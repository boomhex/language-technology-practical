instructions:
To make the spicy salami fritters, first cut the spicy salami into slices about half an inch thick , remove the casing , and then cut the slices into small cubes .
Set aside the chopped salami and prepare the batter: in a bowl, pour in the flour and sparkling water , season with salt and ground black pepper .
Finally, add the instant yeast , mix to combine the ingredients well, and you should have a smooth and slightly runny batter . At this point, add the salami cubes
and mix to distribute them evenly. In a pan, heat the seed oil; for optimal frying, we recommend heating the oil to about 340°F. Once the oil is hot, take a teaspoon of batter and drop it into the oil . Cook the fritters for one minute
then turn them over and continue cooking for another minute until golden . Drain them on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil . The spicy salami fritters are ready to be enjoyed !
Spicy salami fritters are excellent when freshly made but can also be enjoyed warm. We do not recommend storing them in the fridge or freezer after frying.
Try adding a few cubes of provolone cheese to make these fritters even more delicious.
