instructions:
When the weather gets chilly, you really can't beat a legume soup to warm you up. In Italy, they call it "minestra di legumi e curcuma." It's a favorite. Why? Because it's super comforting. This hearty soup mixes cannellini beans, black-eyed peas, and red "Egyptian" lentils. Plus, the turmeric not only gives it that colorful golden hue, but also adds a unique earthy flavor. Which is great. Italians love turmeric for its health perks, so this dish is not just comforting but nourishing too.
And look, whether you call it a bean soup or lentil soup , each spoonful is packed with a soft texture and rich plant-based protein. Perfect for a cozy day, no question. And a classic Italian trick? Toss in some small pasta. It turns the soup from a simple starter into a meal. Pretty simple. This trick makes the soup's texture thicker, almost creamy, blending beautifully with the noodles.
Every bite of this turmeric soup offers a great mix of moist beans, pasta, and veggies. All tied together with turmeric's subtle spice. And here's the thing: this recipe hits all the marks for healthy soup recipes . It's gluten-free if you skip the pasta, totally vegan, and full of stuff that keeps you full and satisfied. This dish is a staple in Italian homes, especially when the temperature drops.
For dinner or lunch, this soup takes everyday ingredients and makes something special. It really highlights Italian comfort food. Call it a chickpea soup , a protein-rich soup , or just a classic comfort dish, it's really all about those warming vibes and super tasty flavors that keep you coming back. So grab a bowl and enjoy the cozy warmth that only a hearty Italian soup can offer.
To prepare the legume and turmeric soup, start by soaking the legumes. Place the legumes in two separate bowls and cover them with cold water (1-2). You can also add the tip of a teaspoon of baking soda to help them soften. Leave them to soak for 10-12 hours. After this time, drain the legumes and proceed with preparing the soup base.
Finely chop the shallot , then let it wilt in extra virgin olive oil over low heat . At this point, add the cannellini beans and then the black-eyed beans and let them season with the shallot.
Cover with about 6 cups of hot water (or broth) and salt. Let it cook for about 50 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the potatoes first into slices and then into rather large cubes .
and immerse them in cold water until ready to use . After 50 minutes, the beans will be tender to the touch, rinse the lentils and add them to the pot .
Then drain and add the potatoes as well . Cook for another 25 minutes or so. Adjust the amount of water or broth by adding more if it has evaporated excessively, season with the rosemary sprig and add the pasta to the pot . Cook for a few minutes, keeping the pasta very al dente, and lastly add the turmeric ,
then adjust the salt and pepper . The soup will be ready when the pasta is cooked but not too mushy, and the rest of the soup will be creamy and well blended . Let the legume and turmeric soup rest for a few minutes and serve it hot, drizzling with raw oil and a sprig of rosemary .
The legume and turmeric soup alone can be stored for up to 3 days in the refrigerator. You can freeze it without pasta.
Add a dice of crispy bacon to your legume and turmeric soup for a more intense flavor!
