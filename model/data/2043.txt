To prepare the cream of polenta, start by boiling water in a large pot; meanwhile, prepare the Brussels sprouts by removing the outer leaves (if there's dirt, you can rinse them under running water), then remove the stem and cut them in half . Peel the shallots, cut them into 2 parts , or if they are very large, divide them into 4 parts.
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a pan, add the shallots , pour 1/2 cup of water , cover with the lid , and cook over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes.
Add the Brussels sprouts to the pot and continue cooking for another 5 minutes, still covered. After the indicated time, remove the lid and continue cooking to let the water evaporate, then add the honey and brown sugar .
Salt and pepper to taste and continue cooking for another 2 minutes or until the vegetables are caramelized . Turn off the heat and set the vegetables aside. Now take care of the soup: when the water in the pot comes to a boil, salt it and add 2 teaspoons of olive oil , pour the instant polenta flour in a thin stream while stirring with a whisk and cook over low heat for 8 minutes, stirring constantly.
Then turn off the heat and pour in the fresh liquid cream and grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese , stir to combine the soup .
Pour the soup into dishes, add the caramelized Brussels sprouts and shallots in the center , enrich with a few tablespoons of vegetable cooking broth , and serve the cream of polenta piping hot !
You can store the Brussels sprouts and shallots for 1-2 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container. The soup tends to solidify, so it's better to serve it immediately. Freezing is not recommended.
You can also serve the soup with speck or bacon strips by sautéing them in a pan to make them crispy.
