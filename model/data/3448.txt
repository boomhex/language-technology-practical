instructions:
To prepare the royal icing, first, pour the egg whites into a bowl . Whisk until you obtain a foamy mixture . Add the powdered sugar .
Whisk vigorously until you get a smooth and dense consistency . At this point, you have obtained your white royal icing. To color it, divide it into several small bowls .
Add a little food coloring and mix . Gradually add the coloring until you get the desired shade. Prepare the other colors in this way; with these quantities, you can make up to 6 .
Now prepare the parchment paper cones and fill them . Get creative with cookie decoration .
Royal icing should be used immediately. It will last about half an hour before becoming hard.
If it dries out too soon, you can warm it in the microwave for a few seconds and then stir vigorously!
We recommend using non-vanilla powdered sugar for a brighter white. To dry the cookies quickly, leave them in a cool place but not in the fridge. Humidity will slow down the drying process of the glaze. You can add a few drops of lemon juice for a shinier glaze. You can add a few drops of flavor to scent the glaze. For food safety, you can use pasteurized egg whites.
