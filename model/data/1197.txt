instructions:
To make the crumble with mortadella and pistachios, first sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl, then add the salt, grated cheese , and cold butter cut into pieces . Quickly mix with your hands .
You should obtain a crumbly dough . At this point, also add the egg yolk and the whole egg . Stir to combine with a fork .
Once the mixture is ready, place it in the fridge . Now, prepare the filling: dice the mortadella and chop the pistachios .
Chop the parsley as well , then place the ricotta, the egg , and the chopped parsley in a bowl .
Season with the chopped pistachios and the mortadella . Add salt and mix to combine the filling .
Line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper, butter the sides, and pour half of the crumbly dough here , compacting it with the back of a spoon . Fill with the ricotta filling, spreading it evenly .
Cover with the remaining dough , then bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 45 minutes. Once cooked, unmold the crumble with mortadella and pistachios , let it cool slightly, and then remove it to serve.
Store the crumble with mortadella and pistachios in the fridge for a couple of days. It can be frozen either raw or cooked.
Do not overwork the crumbly dough as it should remain rather coarse.
