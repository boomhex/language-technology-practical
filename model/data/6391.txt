To make the lasagne with sausage ragu , first peel the carrot, onion, and celery and chop them roughly . Add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to a frying pan , then add the chopped vegetables and brown over high heat for at least 5 minutes .
Meanwhile, take the sausage, make an incision in the skin and remove it carefully using your hands . Once the vegetables have turned golden brown, add the sausage to the pan ,
increase the heat, and break up the sausage using a wooden spoon . Let it brown for about 5 minutes. Then, pour in the red wine and simmer until it evaporates completely. Next, add the tomato puree ,
season with salt and pepper , and stir to combine . Cover the pan with a lid and cook for about 10 minutes.
In the meantime, start making the béchamel sauce: Pour the milk into a saucepan, season with salt and add the nutmeg , then bring to a boil. Melt the butter in another small saucepan , then sprinkle in the flour ,
stirring quickly using a whisk . Next, add the hot milk and, stirring continuously, cook the béchamel until it has thickened .
Once the ragu is ready , all you have to do is assemble the lasagne. Spread a little béchamel on the bottom of a 9x13 inch (20x30 cm) pan and arrange the lasagne sheets on top . Cover with the sausage ragu, another layer of béchamel ,
and a tablespoon of grated Grana Padano cheese . Repeat these steps another five times , alternating the direction of the lasagne sheets each time.
Once you’ve put the final layer of pasta in place, cover with the remaining ragu sauce , béchamel , and Grana Padano . Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 425°F (220°C) for 20 minutes, then switch to broil mode at the highest setting and cook for another 3 minutes.
When the lasagne with sausage ragu is golden brown, take it out of the oven , decorate with oregano and thyme leaves , and serve !
The lasagne can be kept in the fridge for up to 2 days.
It can also be frozen if all the ingredients you used were fresh.
Add fresh caciocavallo cheese between layers to get strings of melted cheese when you cut into it! If you’re not a fan of tomato sauce, you can leave the tomato passata out and just have a “white” version of the ragu with the sausage and vegetables.
