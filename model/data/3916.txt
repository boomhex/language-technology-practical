To prepare tagliatelle with rose petals, start by putting the pasta water on the stove and in the meantime chop the shallot, add it to a pan with the extra virgin olive oil and let it infuse for a few minutes on low heat, stirring to prevent it from sticking; in the meantime cut the cooked ham into cubes and set aside 2 oz for the final garnish . When the shallot is softened, add 3.5 oz of diced cooked ham
let it fry on high heat for a few minutes, until they slightly change color , then add the liquid cream and grate the nutmeg
adjust with salt and ground white pepper and, after mixing everything, turn off the heat and blend with an immersion blender until you get a smooth, homogeneous cream .
As soon as the pasta water reaches a boil, add the pasta and cook it according to the times indicated on the package; meanwhile, gently detach all the petals from the edible roses and clean the petals with a damp cloth, being very careful not to damage them ,
then cut them into thin strips . As soon as the tagliatelle are al dente, drain them, but make sure to keep some of the cooking water to make the sauce creamy and more liquid; mix and add the 2 oz of cooked ham set aside earlier and finally decorate with the strips of rose petals, without further mixing. Serve the tagliatelle with rose petals piping hot .
It is recommended to consume the tagliatelle with rose petals immediately.
Freezing is not recommended.
Tagliatelle is perfect for holding this type of sauce, but if you prefer other shapes, why not try?! For example, you can try with fettuccine, but if you want to "dare" then try with short pasta like penne or farfalle! One last tip, you can also try with roses with pink petals. At the base of each petal, there is a slightly bitter nail, if you want you can remove it to avoid the slight aftertaste.
Flowers, besides being beautiful, colorful, and fragrant, are also edible. Obviously not all of them, and to recognize the edible ones available on the market, even in supermarkets, just read the label for the word "edible," meaning they have not been treated with fertilizers and pesticides. And if you want to be even more sure, try growing roses yourself. Already the ancient Romans used to prepare recipes using flowers. However, they were not the only ones! In fact, among the most recent historical testimonies, it seems that during William Shakespeare's performances, rose water was served.
