instructions:
To prepare the pear and cinnamon jam, wash all the pears well. Cut them into wedges and remove the core , then slice them thinly, about 0.2 inches .
Then cut the slices into julienne strips . Transfer the pear sticks into a bowl and add the sugar .
Add the lemon juice and mix well with your hands. Let it marinate for 15 minutes , then transfer to a not-too-large saucepan to avoid excessive evaporation .
Bring to a boil and let boil for a few moments, then transfer to a bowl . Cover with plastic wrap and let cool. Then place in the fridge for 8 hours.
After this time, take the pears from the fridge and strain them to separate the fruit from the juice which you will pour into another saucepan . Heat over moderate heat and add the cinnamon .
Mix well until dissolved then continue to cook until the syrup reaches a temperature of 221°F. At this point, add the pears .
Mix well and bring to a boil again . The pear and cinnamon jam is ready, transfer it into jars , let it cool, and enjoy it . If you want to use it immediately to prepare the tart, just pour it into a bowl and let it cool.
Pear and cinnamon jam keeps in the refrigerator for about 10 days.
To store the jam for a longer time, proceed with jar pasteurization. Once filled and tightly closed, place them in a pot with cold water and count 20-25 minutes from the boiling point. Then turn off the heat and let them cool in water. The next day, dry them and store them in the pantry. This way they will last about 6 months.
