Torcetti al burro is one of those treats that folks in Piemonte and Valle d’Aosta just love. Really, they do. These traditional Italian cookies are known for that tender, crumbly bite. You know, the kind you get from a dough that’s not just any mix—it's leavened and loaded with rich butter. Gives it that soft feel inside. And the shape? Totally cool. These Italian butter cookies have a twisted look. "Torcetti" comes from how they roll the dough into thin rods, then twist them into ovals or drops before baking. Before popping them in the oven, they get rolled in cane sugar. This gives them a crispy, golden crust that cracks perfectly when you bite in. Seriously good stuff. Makes these cookies work for any time of day—morning coffee, lazy afternoon tea, or a late-night snack.
You won't just find torcetti al burro in fancy pastry shops in northern Italy; they’re a staple in homes across Piemonte . Even if every town has its own little twist on them, what never changes is that light, crumbly texture and the hint of sweet caramel from the sugar. Sometimes people add a touch of honey or lemon zest, but to be honest, butter’s the star. Makes these traditional Italian cookies melt in your mouth. Pair them with a hot espresso or dip them in dessert wine. No question, you’ll see why these Piedmontese cookies are beloved. They're simple yet special, and I mean, they’re the kind of thing that shows up at family gatherings or when you just want something moist and a bit fancy—without too much hassle. Pretty much every bite gives you a taste of something really local, a little slice of the region’s baking history. Perfect for indulging in something rich and comforting, these cookies are really a delight. And you know what? Can't go wrong with that.
To make butter torcetti, dissolve the yeast in warm water (alternatively, you can use 4 g of fresh yeast) . In a large bowl, mix all-purpose flour with salt and sugar (2-3).
Add the dissolved yeast in the water and knead with your hands, initially gathering all the ingredients in the bowl and then working the dough on a countertop ,
until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough ball . Let the dough rise in a bowl covered with plastic wrap, for an hour away from drafts , until it has doubled in volume .
After this time, transfer the dough to a stand mixer bowl (if you don't have one, you can knead by hand), equipped with a hook and add softened butter at room temperature, one piece at a time , kneading at medium speed .
When the butter is completely absorbed, place the dough back in the bowl and let it rise for another hour. If the dough is very sticky, add a little flour or flour the sides of the bowl. When it has doubled in volume , let the dough rest in the fridge for at least half an hour before working it, so the butter firms up. Lightly flour a work surface and divide the dough into small balls of about 0.5 oz each (there will be about 26), which you will shape into a stick about 0.2 inches thick and about 6 inches long .
Twist the stick, rolling the ends and giving it the characteristic twist then join the ends , cross them, and press slightly to secure them . Continue like this until all the dough is used.
Pass the torcetti in brown sugar then place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, well spaced apart . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 25 minutes (convection oven 320°F for 20 minutes): the torcetti should be golden . Remove from the oven, let cool on a rack, and your butter torcetti are ready!
Store the torcetti, once cooled, in a jar with a lid for up to a week! Freezing is not recommended.
The original butter torcetti recipe is contested between the Aosta Valley and Piedmont: both the torcetti of Saint Vincent and those of Lanzo, Agliè, and the Biella valleys are famous. Tracing the origin of the recipe is not easy: as early as the 18th century, the torchietti, twisted cookies made from bread dough, dipped in honey and sugar and baked in the oven, were famous. Torcetti were a pride of the House of Savoy pastry: Queen Margherita loved them and they could not be missing from her table!
Torcetti hold a thousand surprises, so here's what to do in case of:
- dry torcetti: brush them with melted butter before passing them in brown sugar;
- unmanageable dough: leave it in the fridge for at least half an hour.
- torcetti too large: you can halve the size, remembering that in addition to the diameter, the baking time also decreases: from 20 to 12-15 minutes.
