Coffee is an after-lunch treat, but there is another, sweeter way to get your energy hit: crema al caffè . Don’t confuse it with the much more elaborate coffee-flavored diplomat cream or the pastry cream version, both of which are fabulous for filling and decorating a delicious cake! This is the classic whipped cream mixture you get at Italian bars, except better because you can make it yourself with just three ingredients: cream, sugar, and coffee. You can get by with just two ingredients if you like your coffee unsweetened! This fabulous coffee cream can be served as a filling for croissants or with biscuits: We’ve done the research on your behalf and think it tastes best with the gluten-free ones!
When preparing coffee cream , firstly make a batch of coffee in your Italian moka coffee pot, you will need ? cup (70 g). Then add sugar , mix well , and let the coffee cool at room temperature for a few minutes before placing in the fridge for at least 2 hours. When the 2 hours are up, pour the whipping cream into a pre-chilled bowl .
Start to whisk it with an electric beater . As soon as it is half-whipped (i.e., just beginning to thicken) add the previously sweetened coffee that has been chilling in the refrigerator . Pour it slowly onto the cream and carry on beating.
Continue to whisk until the whipped cream is ready . Then cover with plastic wrap and return to the fridge for at least an hour before serving your coffee cream .
The coffee cream can be stored for a day in the fridge. Not suitable for freezing.
You can sprinkle your coffee cream with cinnamon or unsweetened cocoa powder!
