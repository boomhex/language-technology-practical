instructions:
To prepare Gallurese soup, the first thing you need to do is make a good Beef Broth with a strong flavor based on lamb and sheep. Cut the Casizolu cheese in half and grate it ; do the same with the pecorino and gather the cheeses in a bowl.
Add pepper , mix , and set aside. Cut the loaf into slices about 3/8 inch thick .
Then take a deep baking dish measuring about 8x8 inches and lay the slices of bread on the bottom, making sure not to leave any empty spaces . Now distribute a layer of grated cheeses on top to completely cover the slices .
Continue with another layer of bread , one of cheese, and then bread again. You will need to make 4 layers in total. Pour the meat broth over the last layer of bread to cover , poking holes in the bread with a fork so that the liquid can be absorbed better. With the back of a spoon, press the bread on the surface to moisten it well .
Wait a couple of minutes to let the broth be well absorbed, then distribute the rest of the cheese on top , covering completely . Season with another sprinkle of pepper and bake in a preheated oven at 400°F for 30 minutes, or until a golden crust forms on the surface. Once cooked, remove from the oven, let rest for a few minutes, and then serve the Gallurese soup hot .
Gallurese soup can be stored in the fridge for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Casizolu is a stretched curd cheese made from cow's milk typical of Sardinia; if you can't find it, you can use caciocavallo or provola as an alternative.
