Chop the spring onions and let them soften in 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil over low heat for about 10-15 minutes; add the tomato passata , salt, and let cook for about 10 minutes on low heat, then turn off the heat as the tomato sauce should remain fluid and not thick. Add the basil leaves , breaking them with your fingers.
Meanwhile, put 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a pan and add the chopped celery, carrot, and onion , letting them brown over low heat. Then add the crumbled sausage and minced meat . Sauté the meat, trying to make it finer using a spoon to break it up while cooking. When the meat is well-browned, deglaze with the glass of wine , then wait for all the liquid to evaporate over very low heat. Finally, salt, pepper, and turn off the heat.
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the caccavelle for 15 minutes, taking care not to let the boiling become too violent to avoid breaking them during cooking. Meanwhile, cut the mozzarella into cubes not too small (about 0.75 inches per side). Once the caccavelle are drained , place them on a plate. Take the 4 small pans in which you will season and then cook the caccavelle, placing a small ladle of tomato sauce on the bottom of each.
Place the caccavella on top, put a small ladle of tomato sauce inside , then 1.75 oz of crumbled ricotta and a quarter of the ragù .
Then add 1.75 oz of mozzarella . Cover everything with tomato sauce and sprinkle the top with a good tablespoon of grated Parmigiano Reggiano . Prepare all 4 small pans in the same way and then bake in a preheated oven at 392°F for about 30-40 minutes.
