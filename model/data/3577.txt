To prepare the tart with mixed pesto and bacon, start with the preparation of Easy Shortcrust Pastry . Combine in a mixer the flour , cold butter from the fridge cut into pieces , a pinch of salt, and blend everything until you get a sandy and floury mixture .
At this point, place the obtained mixture in a bowl and, adding cold water a little at a time, knead everything quickly , then transfer it to a work surface and continue to knead until you get a firm and fairly elastic dough . Once ready, wrap your shortcrust pastry in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, start preparing the pesto for your filling. Pour the basil, parsley , marjoram , walnuts, and almonds into a mixer.
Then add the pistachios, chives , and garlic clove , then pulse the mixer several times, rather than continuously, pouring the oil in a thin stream .
Once you have obtained a homogeneous pesto , add the ricotta and turn the mixer on for a few moments more to blend everything .
In a separate small bowl, beat the eggs and pour them into the freshly prepared pesto , add salt and pepper, then mix again with a spatula .
At this point, cut the bacon into cubes and sauté it in a pan, without adding anything, for about 5 minutes, until it becomes crispy . Let it cool slightly, then pour it into the pesto mixture .
After 40 minutes, take out the shortcrust pastry, place it on a lightly floured work surface, and start rolling it out with a rolling pin until you get a thickness of about 3/8 inch . Then transfer the pastry to a 10-inch tart pan, previously greased and floured, by rolling the dough around the rolling pin and unrolling it onto the pan. Remove the excess dough, always using the rolling pin, pressing it well on the edges of the pan and set it aside.
Pour the previously prepared pesto into the pan and level it slightly . Take the excess dough, roll it out again, always obtaining a thickness of about 3/8 inch, and cut it into strips .
Place the strips on top of the mixture and brush them with the previously beaten egg . Bake in a static oven at 338°F for 50 minutes (if using a fan oven, bake at 302°F for about 40 minutes). Remove from the oven and let the tart with mixed pesto and bacon cool slightly before serving.
The tart with mixed pesto and bacon can be stored, once cooked, for a maximum of 3 days covered with plastic wrap and placed in the refrigerator, you might also choose to freeze it.
To further enhance the flavor of your tart, add some diced provola and Parmesan once the pesto is prepared!
