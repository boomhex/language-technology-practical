instructions:
To prepare the baked zucchini flowers with Grana Padano and anchovies, start with the filling: place the coarsely broken bread, parsley , Grana Padano PDO , and drained anchovies in a food processor.
Season with olive oil , pepper, and salt. Blend for a few minutes until the ingredients are well combined . Set the filling aside. Now, proceed to clean the zucchini flowers: gently detach the stem, rinse them delicately under running water, and dry them with a cloth. Then, gently open each one and, using scissors, remove the internal pistil .
Fill them with a teaspoon, applying little pressure to avoid breaking the flower . You will need about 3 teaspoons of filling for each zucchini flower. Close them by gently twisting the tips and arrange them alternately in a baking dish .
Sprinkle them with grated Grana Padano PDO , covering them completely , and bake in a preheated grill oven at 450°F for 7 minutes. Serve the baked zucchini flowers with Grana Padano and anchovies immediately .
Baked zucchini flowers with Grana Padano and anchovies can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Freezing is not recommended.
Choose flowers with stems, larger and with a delicate flavor, making them ideal for stuffing!
