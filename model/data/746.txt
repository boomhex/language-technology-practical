In this recipe, there's a mix of type 0 flour and semolina. Gives the loaf a rustic, golden look. And really, every bite? Extra soft.
But here's the thing, it's not just about the texture. The taste is what really stands out.

People slice it for lunch, bring it to picnics, or just pull it apart while it's still warm from the oven. Even though it looks all impressive with its braided shape, it's actually pretty simple. Which is great.
And listen, it's the kind of homemade braided bread that surprises you with how much flavor it packs in.
