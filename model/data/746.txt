instructions:
To prepare the risotto with pumpkin, chestnuts, and gorgonzola, the first thing to do is to cut the Neapolitan pumpkin into slices about 0.4 inches thick . Remove the skin and cut into cubes about 0.4 inches large . In a pot, heat some water that will be used for cooking the risotto. Melt 5 tablespoons of butter in a pot .
Once melted, add the rice and toast it for a few minutes on medium heat, stirring occasionally . Deglaze with white wine , stir, and let it evaporate completely.
Add the now hot water until it covers the rice . Add the pumpkin , a pinch of salt, and pepper .
Cook the rice by adding more hot water as needed and stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, cut the chestnuts into small pieces and add them when the rice is cooked .
Mix well and turn off the heat . Add the gorgonzola and the remaining butter .
Add the parmesan cheese and cream the risotto by stirring well . Plate the rice, add a few thyme leaves, and serve it very hot .
The risotto can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days, closed in an airtight container.
Flavor the risotto with some chopped rosemary.
Instead of water, you can use a delicate vegetable broth to cook the rice.
