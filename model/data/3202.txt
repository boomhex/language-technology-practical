Fondant is a French pastry classic, you know, with its shiny, smooth finish that really makes treats like éclairs and cream puffs pop. When people think of a great fondant recipe , it's all about getting that glossy, tender sugar layer just right. It melts perfectly over desserts—super satisfying. Unlike rolled fondant for cakes, this one's a moist glaze that clings to pastries, giving them an amazing finish. I mean, the trick is working the sugar, water, and glucose at just the right temperature—around 60 degrees Celsius—to create a compact, smooth mixture that keeps its shine without cracking. Pretty important.
Seriously, use the right tools, like a thermometer. You don’t want your fondant to turn out dull or crusty. And look, in many French pastry shops, you’ll find homemade fondant being gently melted—like a silky bath—to cover bignè and éclairs while keeping its tender texture. People love how straightforward it is once you get the hang of it. Tons of options for fondant cake designs . While the sweet taste is classic, it's the texture and appearance that make it essential for anyone into cake decorating techniques .
Adding a bit of glucose can help keep it shiny and prevent those annoying cracks. Seems simple, but nailing the details—especially temperature and mixing—results in a glossy, moist finish that makes any treat look like it came straight from a pastry shop. For sure. If you're looking to boost your baking skills, learning this fondant icing method is a fantastic skill to have. It's more than just taste; it's about making something that looks as amazing as it tastes. And here's the thing: your desserts will definitely stand out on any occasion.
To prepare fondant sugar, start by putting a saucepan on the stove and melting the granulated sugar together with the water and glucose .
Keep the flame on low and stir the mixture with a small whisk, bringing it to a temperature of 237°F-239°F (4-5). To verify the temperature, a sugar thermometer is necessary. Once the sugar has reached this temperature, transfer it to a bowl ,
and stir it with a spoon, cooling it down to a temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit (7-8). At this point, work it in the stand mixer equipped with a paddle attachment until you obtain a white and compact block .
Once you have obtained the block, you can store it in the refrigerator, vacuum-sealed or in a food storage bag, removing as much air as possible . If you wish to use it immediately, skip this step and put the block in a double boiler until it becomes liquid again, being careful not to exceed 140°F , otherwise, when glazing pastries, the fondant sugar will tend to crack and become dull.
At this point, you can flavor the fondant sugar according to the preparation you want to achieve. If, for example, you want to prepare chocolate fondant sugar, dissolve the cocoa powder in a splash of water , add it to the fondant sugar , and mix well until you have a uniform color . We recommend doing this operation while keeping the fondant sugar in a double boiler at a temperature of 140°F.
If you want to flavor it with caramel, prepare the caramel sauce ( Caramel for the recipe) and add it to the fondant, mixing well, always maintaining the temperature at 140°F (16-17). Alternatively, you can also use food colorings, preferably in powder form, and mix them with the fondant sugar to achieve the color shades you prefer . In this case, too, you should keep the temperature at 140°F. If the fondant sugar dries too much, add a little hot water to regain the right consistency. Mix well to blend, and when you reach a dense but creamy consistency, your fondant sugar is ready to make your pastries beautiful, such as the Éclair from GialloZafferano!
Vacuum-sealed fondant sugar can be stored for several months in the refrigerator. When you want to use it, simply melt it in a double boiler, taking care to keep it at a temperature of 140°F.
While decorating your pastries, keep the fondant in a double boiler over very low heat, otherwise, you won't be able to spread it because it will be too thick.
