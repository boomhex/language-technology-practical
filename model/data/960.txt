Palermitan spitini are like a love letter to Palermo's vibrant street food scene. Seriously good stuff. And these aren't just any Sicilian spiedini . Nope, they're something else. Picture this: three layers of soft brioche or sandwich bread, alternating with two layers of rich ragù mixed with peas. The whole thing is slathered in creamy besciamella—oh yeah—and then it's battered, rolled in breadcrumbs, and deep-fried till it's all crispy and golden. Inside? Super moist and flavorful, with bread soaking up that classic Sicilian ragù. It's so, so good.
Generations in Palermo have been chowing down on spitini, and bakeries like the legendary Antica Panelleria Da Nino (seriously, a must-visit) stick to the old-school recipe, making sure each bite feels like a trip back to 1890. Among all the Palermo street food options, these skewers really stand out. They blend the comforting texture of bread with a hearty beef spiedini core, but with a totally unique twist. And the sauce? Perfection. Take a bite, and you'll get a mix of crispy crust, soft layers, and a warm, savory center. Plus, there's a little sweetness from the peas and richness from the meat.
It is not just about taste; spitini are really, really a part of Sicilian cuisine , showing off the care and love in traditional Sicilian recipes . And you know what? They hang out with other street food legends like pane e panelle, ravazzate, and rizzuole. Each bite just screams history, tradition and family vibes. Whether you're all about learning Sicilian cooking techniques or just want a snack that really hits the spot, spitini are a fantastic start. Next time you're dreaming of Italian appetizers or want something with a true sense of place, give these a try. Can't go wrong.

To make the Palermo-style skewers, start the day before with the vegetable broth and the ragù, which will need to rest to become well thickened and manageable. Prepare a classic vegetable broth and keep it warm. Move on to the ragù: finely chop celery, carrot , and onion into a mirepoix .
Place the chopped vegetables in a pan, add a bit of water and a bit of oil . Start cooking on very low heat to wilt everything, and the water should almost completely absorb .
Then add the meat, crumble it , and sauté for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Deglaze with the red wine , and once evaporated, add the hot broth .
You can also add the tomato paste, 2 bay leaves , and finally, the peas . Adjust with salt and pepper and let it cook for 60-70 minutes.
The result should be a nice thick ragù . Let it rest overnight in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container. The next day, you will need 400 g of béchamel (if already prepared, just make sure it is very thick; otherwise, you can make it following our recipe!); slice the small brioches, shaping them with a knife into a square: remove the top and side parts, leaving the base . Divide into three equal parts .
Take some ragù, work it between your hands to create a kind of meatball to insert between two pieces of brioche. Another bit of shaped ragù should be inserted between the second piece of brioche and the last one . In total, you will have in sequence: brioche, ragù, brioche, ragù, and brioche to close the skewer.
Spread the surface with béchamel , sprinkle with breadcrumbs . Turn the skewer and do the same by spreading béchamel and sprinkling breadcrumbs on the other side as well. Let all the skewers rest in the fridge for 1 hour (you will get 12 with these doses).
Prepare a batter by pouring part of the water and the flour , mix and adjust to add more water to obtain a smooth and homogeneous batter. Pass each skewer through the batter .
Now in the breadcrumbs . Heat the seed oil to 356°F (180°C) and fry 1 or 2 pieces at a time .
Drain them on absorbent paper when they are evenly golden . Here are the Palermo-style skewers ready !
You can also prepare the ragù and béchamel one or two days in advance.
Once ready, it is best to consume the skewers on the same day.
You can add an egg to the water and flour batter so that the skewer's breading becomes more golden and crispy.
You can skip the resting phase of the skewers before passing them in the batter, if they are well compact.
The béchamel should be very dense.
You can also use sandwich bread to make the skewers, either in small bites or as large as the bread slices!
Antica Panelleria da Nino in Palermo is an institution for the city's typical street food, like panelle and skewers. It has been open since 1890 and has always been a family-run business. Francesco Lelio, part of the fourth generation, began working in the panelleria in 1977, in full respect of the founder Andrea Lelio's intentions: "to provide future generations with centuries-old knowledge of a straightforward, genuine, typical, and proudly Palermitan cuisine".
