instructions:
To prepare the salmon demi baguettes, start with the quick marination of the salmon. Use a thin, sharp knife to remove the skin and first slice the salmon, then cut it into strips and finally into cubes. At this point, chop it with a knife to create a tartare-like puree. Place it in a bowl and season with extra virgin olive oil, salt, pepper, some sprigs of dill, grated untreated lemon zest, and a few drops of Tabasco. Mix and set aside for a moment. Halve the avocados and remove the seed. Slide a spoon between the skin and the flesh to extract it without damage. Slice thinly and place in a bowl, drizzling with lemon juice. Open the pomegranate and collect the seeds in a bowl. Now that everything is ready, halve the baguettes lengthwise. Generously butter them with salted butter and toast them in a non-stick pan, placing the crumb side down. As soon as they are lightly toasted, remove the baguettes from the pan. Spread some crème fraîche on the two bases, then add the seasoned salmon, avocado slices, pomegranate seeds, and some cress sprouts. Cut in two, obtaining 4 salmon demi baguettes, and enjoy them right away.
Once your salmon demi baguettes are ready, it is recommended to consume them immediately.
Want an extra acidic touch along with a tropical hint? Add some thin slices of mango or sweet and sour ginger.
Before consuming raw, marinated, or undercooked fish, it is recommended to freeze it for at least 96 hours at 0°F in a domestic freezer marked with 3 or more stars, as per Ministry of Health guidelines .
