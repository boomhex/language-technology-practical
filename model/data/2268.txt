To prepare the crispy spiced salmon bites, start by making the coating. Pour the breadcrumbs and cornmeal into a bowl ; then add the ground white pepper, mustard powder , paprika, and pistachio crumbs .
Add the salt and mix everything together. Add the finely grated lemon zest and curry . Mix again and set aside.
Take the salmon fillet, remove any bones , and remove the skin if present. Cut it into slices about 1.2 inches wide, then divide each slice in half to make triangles. Once all the bites are done, transfer them to a small bowl and season with salt , oil, and pepper. Mix to combine the ingredients, ensuring each piece of salmon is well oiled, so the coating adheres perfectly.
Place each salmon bite inside the bowl with the coating , then roll it inside to coat all sides . Lay the triangles on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper
and continue this way until all pieces are done . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 8-10 minutes (if using a convection oven, bake at 320°F for about 6 minutes). Meanwhile, as the salmon cooks, make the faux mayonnaise. Pour the seed oil into the glass of an immersion blender and add the filtered orange juice .
Add the soy milk and blend everything with an immersion blender until you get a creamy mayonnaise, then transfer it to a small bowl .
Add the orange zest and mix to combine everything. Once the crispy and spiced salmon bites are out of the oven , serve them hot with the orange faux mayonnaise .
It is advisable to serve the crispy spiced salmon bites as soon as they are prepared; with the humidity of the refrigerator, they would lose their crispness. Freezing is not recommended.
Flavor the coating with your preferred herbs, and for a bolder taste... prepare a classic mayonnaise!
