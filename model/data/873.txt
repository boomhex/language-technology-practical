instructions:
To prepare the zeppole with mascarpone cream and coffee, first make the choux pastry. In a saucepan, pour the water and butter . Turn on medium heat and bring to a near boil, stirring to melt the butter .
Then pour the flour all at once and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon to obtain a lump-free mixture. Cook until the dough detaches from the sides of the pan and a whitish film forms on the bottom .
Transfer the dough to the bowl of a stand mixer , attach the paddle and mix the dough at medium-low speed. Meanwhile, beat the eggs and yolk together ,
When the dough is no longer steaming, pour the eggs in slowly . This may take a few minutes, but we recommend doing this step slowly to get a good choux pastry. When you have a smooth and homogeneous mixture , turn off the mixer and use a spatula to transfer it into a piping bag with a 1/4 inch star nozzle . Refrigerate until needed.
At this point, make the coffee and let it cool. When the coffee is cold, start preparing the Mascarpone cream . Pour the mascarpone into the mixer, turn on the whisk for a few seconds to soften it, then add the cream . Set the whisks to medium speed and add the powdered sugar gradually . When the cream is almost whipped, slowly pour in the coffee .
When you have a firm and smooth cream , transfer it into a piping bag with a 3/8 inch star nozzle and put it in the fridge to cool. Now proceed to cook the zeppole. Prepare 10 squares of parchment paper, 4 inches large. Pour the oil into a saucepan and heat it to 356°F, using a kitchen thermometer to measure it. Now take the choux pastry out of the fridge and pipe the zeppole onto the parchment paper ,
making a double loop of dough . You should get circles about 2.5 inches large. When the oil is at temperature (check with a kitchen thermometer), transfer the first two zeppole into the pot, face down. The parchment paper will detach on its own after a short time, help remove it with kitchen tongs . Once the paper is removed, turn the zeppole to the other side with a slotted spoon .
The zeppole should cook for about 3 minutes on each side; when they are well golden, drain them and transfer them to a tray with paper towels to remove the excess oil . Continue cooking the zeppole, then place them on a plate .
Decorate the zeppole with a dollop of coffee cream , add a dusting of unsweetened cocoa powder , and serve them !
We recommend consuming the zeppole within a few hours. Alternatively, they can be stored in the fridge for up to one day, well covered.
Instead of unsweetened cocoa powder, you can decorate the zeppole with a little coffee powder.
