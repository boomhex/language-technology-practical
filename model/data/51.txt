instructions:
To make the Christmas punch, first prepare the tea: bring the water to a boil in a saucepan, then add the tea bags and let them steep off the heat for about 6-7 minutes. Remove the tea bags and add the sugar .
Stir and let it dissolve completely , then add the orange peels and the rum .
Squeeze the oranges ; you should obtain 7 oz of juice. Pour the orange juice into the saucepan , then flavor with star anise and cinnamon .
Turn the stove back on and let it simmer for about 2-3 minutes . At this point, strain the mixture with a fine-mesh sieve ; to obtain an even clearer liquid, you can use a cheesecloth or paper towel .
Fill 4 glasses each with a capacity of 6.8 oz and garnish each with half an orange slice and the currants . Your Christmas punch is ready to be enjoyed hot !
The Christmas punch can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days.
