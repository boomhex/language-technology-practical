The porcini and prosciutto roll —it's really something, you know?—brings together those classic Italian flavors in a way that's a bit different from the usual pizza or pasta. Picture this: golden, flaky puff pastry filled with layers of prosciutto cotto , earthy porcini mushrooms, melted Edam cheese, and tangy sun-dried tomatoes. Seriously good. This combo comes together like a savory strudel, mixing tender ham and mushrooms with gooey cheese inside the pastry. And look, while this porcini mushroom roll doesn't hail from a specific Italian region, it combines those favorite ingredients from Italian kitchens in a new way, making it a fun choice for your next gathering.
This prosciutto roll recipe is a hit at parties—no question—especially since it’s easy to make ahead and serve when guests arrive. The crispy puff pastry exterior contrasts with the moist, savory, cheesy interior, making it easy to slice and share. For real. Guests can grab a piece as they chat and sip their drinks. The flavors—prosciutto cotto, porcini, and sun-dried tomatoes—remind you of pizza toppings, but wrapping them in pastry gives it a fancier appetizer vibe. Pretty simple.
Plus, the porcini and prosciutto roll is perfect when you want something that looks impressive but is easy to make. It's got a bit of that "tripudio di sapore" from Italy, where every bite points out sweet and savory flavors, creamy cheese, and that rich mushroom kick. Next time you need a snack that feels special, this porcini mushroom and prosciutto roll is a smart pick—easy to prep, easy to eat, and packed with flavor. Can't go wrong.
To prepare the porcini and ham roll start with the How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms : with a sharp knife blade scrape the dirt from the mushroom and remove the harder and earthy end part of the stem. You can eliminate the remaining dirt with a brush; however, if the porcini has a lot, rinse it quickly under cold water to avoid it absorbing too much water and clean it thoroughly with a cloth . Then, by gripping the stem of the mushroom, perform a twisting motion to separate it from the cap. Cut thin slices from both parts and set them aside.
Take a non-stick pan and brown a peeled and whole garlic clove with the oil ; when it turns golden, add the mushrooms , seasoning with salt and pepper. Let cook over low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Once cooked, remove the garlic clove and set the mushrooms aside, allowing them to cool slightly. Now roll out the puff pastry on a work surface and place the slightly overlapping slices of ham in the center: make sure to leave about 3/4 inch (2 cm) from the side edges so that when rolled, the filling remains well sealed. Arrange half of the now cooled porcini mushrooms on top and the sun-dried tomatoes .
Also lay down slices of cheese , then create a layer with the remaining mushrooms and more sun-dried tomatoes .
Finally, add another layer of cheese and ham . Brush the edges of the pastry with beaten egg . Take the short sides of the pastry and fold them inward, over the filling .
Then start to roll up from the long side of the pastry : bring it inward over the filling, gently rolling until you form a compact cylinder . Seal all edges well to prevent the filling from leaking during cooking . Place the roll on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush the entire surface of the roll with the remaining beaten egg .
Now it's ready to be baked: cook it in a preheated static oven at 392°F (200°C) for 25 minutes (if using a fan oven, at 356°F/180°C for 15 minutes). Once the cooking time is up, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes to better compact the filling. Then cut it into slices and serve the porcini and ham roll to your friends!
We recommend consuming the porcini and ham roll while still warm. If there are leftovers, you can store it for up to 2 days covered with transparent plastic wrap in the refrigerator.
If you have used fresh and not thawed ingredients, you can also freeze it, preferably raw, and cook it directly in the oven without thawing (however, it will require a few more minutes of cooking).
Don't like Edam? No problem: replace it with other cheese such as Latteria or Pecorino! We do not recommend using mozzarella as a substitute though, as the prolonged baking would release too much liquid!
