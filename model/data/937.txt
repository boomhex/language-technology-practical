instructions:
To prepare the chestnut cake, first fill a saucepan with water, add a little coarse salt , and pour in the chestnuts . When it starts boiling, cover with a lid and cook for about 30-40 minutes (depending on the size of the chestnuts).
After the time has passed, drain and start peeling them while still hot , making sure to remove the skin underneath the shell. As you clean them, transfer them to a bowl , you will need to obtain 7 oz.
Let them cool. Set aside a couple for decoration and transfer the rest to a mixer . Blend until you get a kind of grainy flour , then set aside. Separate the yolks from the egg whites into two bowls. In the bowl with the yolks, add the brown sugar ,
the blended chestnuts , the rum , and the sifted flour .
Work with electric beaters until you get a creamy mixture . Scrape all the mixture well with a spatula, including from the edges of the bowl. Now attend to the chocolate: break it into pieces and put it in a small saucepan with the butter .
Melt everything over very low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon , alternatively, you can use the microwave for this operation. Let the chocolate cool, then add it to the mixture and mix with a spatula .
Whisk the egg whites until very stiff , then add them to the mixture, gently incorporating them with upward movements . When you have obtained a homogeneous mixture ,
add the sifted baking powder and mix gently again to incorporate it . Butter a rectangular 9x6 inch mold and pour the mixture into it .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F on the lower shelf for about 30 minutes. Always check the cooking by doing the toothpick test. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool. Dust with unsweetened cocoa powder , decorate with the chestnuts set aside earlier, brushing them with a little honey, and serve your chestnut cake .
Store the cake under a glass dome for a couple of days at room temperature.
If you don't like rum, you can use the same amount of milk.
If you prefer to use a round mold, you can use a 9 inch one.
