instructions:
To prepare the oven-baked gratin mushrooms, start by cleaning the mushrooms: cut off the dirtiest part of the stem base, then gently remove excess dirt by rubbing both the pleurotus and honey mushrooms with a damp cloth. If necessary, scrape them with a smooth-edged knife . If there's a lot of dirt, you can quickly rinse the mushrooms under cold water, but it’s preferable not to soak them to avoid water absorption. Cut the pleurotus caps and slice them into slices about 1/8 inch thick.
Slice the stems in the same way . Leave the honey mushrooms whole. Crumble the stale bread with your hands . Blend it with a mixer and place it in a bowl.
Chop the fresh parsley and garlic . Season the bread with parsley and garlic
and the grated zest of half a lemon . Finally, add the salt and mix to combine the ingredients. Arrange the mushroom slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , slightly overlapping each other. Drizzle with 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil .
Distribute the breadcrumb mixture with parsley, garlic, and lemon over the mushroom surface . Drizzle with the remaining 1 tbsp of oil and garnish with lemon slices . Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F, in static mode, for 15 minutes. Switch to fan mode, still at 350°F, and continue baking for another 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and enjoy immediately .
Gratin mushrooms should be consumed immediately. Freezing is not recommended.
Serve the oven-baked gratin mushrooms with a Roast veal with potatoes , a Meatloaf , or Veal scalloppini with white wine and parsley !
