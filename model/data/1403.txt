Corn blinis. Seriously good. These little pancakes from Russia are perfect when you want something tasty and unique. Really, they're a cross between a pancake and a crepe, with a hearty feel—so so satisfying. This version uses fine cornmeal—which gives each bite a slightly crispy edge. And the topping? Skyr —an Icelandic yogurt—adds a light, moist touch. It’s a fresh, airy layer that’s way way better than heavy toppings.
When summer comes around, these make an awesome choice for a laid-back dinner on the patio or just hanging out with friends. Adding avocado and roasted cherry tomatoes really really kicks things up a notch. The avocado? Cool and smooth. Works great with the tangy skyr. And look, those cherry tomatoes—they're roasted to golden perfection, bursting with a sweet pop of juiciness.

To prepare corn blinis with skyr, avocado, and roasted cherry tomatoes, pour the cornmeal and all-purpose flour into a bowl , add the instant yeast and stream in the milk while stirring with a whisk .
Separate the yolk from the egg white and add the yolk to the batter . Stir and add the salt and oil , mixing to incorporate all the ingredients.
Cover with plastic wrap and let it sit at a temperature of 80°F for about 90 minutes. In the meantime, take care of the cherry tomatoes: take the bunches without detaching the tomatoes and wash everything under running water. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, drizzle with oil and dried oregano .
Add salt to taste and bake in a preheated static oven at 390°F for 40 minutes. After the cooking time, remove the cherry tomatoes from the oven and let them cool . Using an electric whisk, whip the reserved egg white along with another 35g of egg white until stiff peaks form (11 and 12).
Take the rested batter and gently fold in the whipped egg whites a little at a time . Once the batter is ready , cook the blinis: heat and lightly oil a flat pan (you can use a paper towel to spread the oil over the surface). Pour a few spoonfuls of batter to create disks about 2.5 inches in diameter and cook over medium-low heat.
Once the base is golden, gently flip them to cook the other side as well . Continue this way with all of them, and once cooked, place them on a serving plate . With these quantities, you will get about 20 blinis.
Cut an avocado in half, remove the pit . Peel the avocado and then dice the flesh .
Pour into a bowl and squeeze the juice of a lemon, filtering it with a strainer ; this will prevent the avocado flesh from oxidizing. Season with a drizzle of oil and white pepper to taste. You can decorate each corn blini with a spoonful of skyr ,
diced avocado and roasted cherry tomatoes . Your corn blinis with skyr, avocado, and roasted cherry tomatoes are ready to be served .
Store the untopped blinis under a glass dome for 1-2 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
