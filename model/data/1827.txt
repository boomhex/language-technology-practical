instructions:
To make the whole wheat crepes, beat the whole egg , and in another small bowl, melt the butter. Pour the whole wheat flour into a larger bowl, add the salt , then gradually pour in the milk while stirring with a whisk, to prevent lumps from forming.
Once the milk is absorbed, add the beaten egg and the melted butter at room temperature , continuing to stir with the whisk to obtain a homogeneous batter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Heat a crepe maker or a non-stick skillet about 8 inches in diameter, grease the bottom with a little butter , and pour a ladleful of batter . Tilt the pan to allow the mixture to spread evenly on the bottom and cook for 3 minutes on one side
and 2 minutes on the other . As the whole wheat crepes are ready, place them on a plate and then fill them with sweet or savory ingredients of your choice !
The whole wheat crepes can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days, covered with plastic wrap, to prevent them from drying out. The crepe batter can be left to rest for up to 12 hours in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap. The crepes can be frozen after cooking: just stack them on top of each other with a sheet of parchment paper between each crepe and finally wrap them with plastic wrap. Before using the desired amount, simply let them thaw and then fill as you like.
