the chestnut flour and all-purpose flour . Then add the baking powder ,
mix with a fork and add both the chocolate chips and the whole unpeeled almonds .
Mix again and if necessary add more all-purpose flour, then transfer the mixture onto a lightly floured surface and compact it with your hands .
Then divide the dough into 3 parts and shape each portion into a sausage about 10 inches long (17-18).
Arrange them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them apart . Bake in a static oven at 356°F for 20 minutes on the middle shelf, then take them out and wait a few minutes. When they are not hot, transfer the first log onto a cutting board and cut it into oblique slices about 0.6 inches thick .
place the cantucci back on the baking sheet and bake them again for another 5 minutes. Then take the cookies out and let them cool before serving .
You can store the cantucci for a week in a tin box.
For a more delicate flavor, use 150 g of chestnut flour and 150 g of all-purpose flour. You can also replace the chocolate chips with 3.5 oz of dark chocolate cut into small pieces.
