Sfoglie alle olive is one of those Italian snacks that's really something special. I mean, the crispy texture and strong taste are just, well, amazing. Picture layers of pasta sfoglia (puff pastry) topped with juicy pomodorini ciliegino , sweet cipolle rosse di Tropea , and plenty of chopped olives. It's all mixed with fresh mint—so so good. This isn't your everyday appetizer—it's a classic antipasto vegetariano , perfect for an aperitivo or if you're craving something tasty. And you know what? The colors are super inviting, with red tomatoes and deep purple onions. Pretty much a visual feast.
Plus, the aroma? Seriously amazing, thanks to the blend of tangy onion and fresh mint. It gives you that real Mediterranean vibe—like a vacation in a bite. And here's the thing, if you're into strong, intense flavors, these sfoglie alle olive are a hit. Tropea onions have this unique sweetness—softer and a bit sweeter than regular ones. Mix that with moist cherry tomatoes and salty olives, and it's just super satisfying.
These snacks? They disappear fast at parties, no question. They're tender and easy to eat by hand, but mostly people just can't resist grabbing another. Really.

To prepare the puff pastries with olives, onions, and cherry tomatoes, you can start by cleaning and finely slicing the Tropea onion . To reduce its strong flavor, you could soak it for about 1 hour in cold water. Then move on to the cherry tomatoes: rinse them under running water, then cut them in half, remove the seeds, and cut them into wedges . Place them in a small bowl and add the sliced onion .
Then take the fresh mint leaves (you can also use dried mint) and chop them very finely. In another small bowl, pour the olive oil and a teaspoon of white wine vinegar , then salt and pepper to taste.
Mix to emulsify and add the mint to the emulsion then season the cherry tomatoes and onion slices . Mix and let rest for a few minutes so the vegetables can absorb the flavors. Then you can assemble your puff pastries with olives: spoon a teaspoon of the tomato and onion salad onto each pastry . You can serve your puff pastries with olives, onions, and cherry tomatoes!
You can store the puff pastries with olives, onions, and cherry tomatoes for 1-2 days in the refrigerator. Freezing is not recommended.
