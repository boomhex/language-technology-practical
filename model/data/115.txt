Risoni with leeks , robiola cheese , and hazelnuts is a beloved dish from Northern Italy. Honestly, it’s a favorite in regions like Piedmont and Lombardy. This dish? All about bringing cozy vibes to your table. Risoni, a pasta shaped like plump rice grains, is perfect when you’re craving something creamy and comforting.
So here’s the thing, the magic really happens when you treat the risoni like a risotto: toast it a bit, then simmer slowly in vegetable broth until it’s soft and tender. The result? A creamy pasta dish that feels like a warm hug on a chilly day. You know the leeks are cooked until they're sweet and mellow, blending into the robiola for a rich, melty sauce that wraps around each grain of pasta. Pretty simple. Topping it off are roasted hazelnuts —adding a crunchy texture that makes every bite exciting.

What’s wonderful about this risoni recipe is that it doesn’t require any rare ingredients—just a few quality ones to create layers of flavor.
The mix of creamy robiola, mellow tender leeks, and nutty hazelnuts keeps it interesting without being overpowering. Some versions might swap in orzo pasta. Which is great. But the traditional risoni shape gives it that almost-risotto feel. Whether you think of it as a vegetarian pasta recipe or just your new favorite comfort food, it’s easy to see why this dish is a staple in Italian homes. And look, it’s the kind of meal you make again and again, because everyone loves diving in, and you never tire of the crunchy nuts paired with that silky, creamy sauce.
