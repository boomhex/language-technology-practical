instructions:
To prepare the little octopuses in purgatory, start by cleaning the little octopuses: empty and rinse the inside of the head under running water , then remove the beak located between the tentacles . Move to the stove: in a saucepan, heat the oil with the cloves of garlic in their skins, the parsley stems, and the chili pepper split in half .
Add the little octopuses and brown them, stirring often, until the water has dried out and the little octopuses have changed color . At this point, pour in the previously crushed peeled tomatoes .
Cover with a lid and cook over medium heat for 40 minutes . Meanwhile, chop the parsley leaves set aside . After this time, salt, pepper, and flavor with parsley, keeping a little aside for garnishing .
Continue cooking for another 20 minutes, this time without the lid . Plate and garnish with the reserved parsley . Your little octopuses in purgatory are ready to be served !
The little octopuses in purgatory can be stored for 2-3 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container.
You can add tomato paste to make the sauce even creamier if you wish.
If you want to use the little octopuses in purgatory to dress pasta, slightly increase the dose of peeled tomatoes.
