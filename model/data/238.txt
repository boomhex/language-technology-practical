Today we are taking you to Belgium and the Netherlands to taste the delicious and crunchy speculoos, aromatic cookies characterized by a hazelnut color due to the presence of various spices in the dough, among which cinnamon stands out. The origin of their name is much debated: some claim it derives from the Latin species meaning spices, while others believe the word speculoos comes from the wooden molds used for these cookies, upon which traditional character shapes are carved and "imprinted" on the cookie dough with slight pressure, "specularly" so to speak. Speculoos are now widespread in many Northern European countries and America; their fame increased after the commercialization of a spreadable cream made of butter and crumbled speculoos was introduced a few years ago. Tasty and fragrant, speculoos are a delicacy to try as a holiday treat! And to create a bag of Christmas cookies to give as a gift, you might consider pairing them with typical Spanish sweets of the period like polvorones !
To prepare the speculoos cookies, start by placing the flour and cold butter cut into pieces in a blender , blend until you get a sandy texture . Place the mixture obtained on a work surface, add the brown sugar, and mix everything with your hands, giving the flour the classic fountain shape .
Add the ground black pepper (about 2 grams) and ground cloves , then the grated nutmeg and baking soda , and finally the cinnamon .
Pour the water into the fountain and knead with your hands until you get a compact dough. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 3-4 hours (or even overnight), so that the dough compacts and the spices can better permeate and release their aroma . After this time, take the dough, slightly soften it with your hands if you can't work it, and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface using a rolling pin .
Roll out a sheet about 1/8-1/4 inch thick and use a cookie cutter with a diameter of 2.5 inches x 1.5 inches to cut out the speculoos . Gather the dough scraps, re-knead very quickly, and roll out the dough again to get the other cookies: doing so will yield about 20 pieces. Gradually place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Before baking, it's preferable to let them rest for 5-10 minutes in the refrigerator so they retain their shape. Then bake them in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 15 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack. Your speculoos are ready to be eaten !
Store the cookies in a tin box or glass jar for up to a week. You can freeze the shortcrust pastry dough, making sure to thaw it in the refrigerator.
Experiment with the spice blend of the speculoos according to your taste, feeling free to try new flavors and aromas. You can also add ginger for a fresh scent or replace the spices with poppy seeds or black pepper. You can use white sugar as a substitute, but the molasses note really makes them special: our advice is to try them with brown sugar!
Speculoos, now available all year round as a sweet product, originated as typical sweets of Belgium and the Netherlands, produced and consumed on the occasion of St. Nicholas Day, December 6th. Speculoos are also popular in Northern France and Germany, where they are mainly found under the name spekulatius during the Christmas holidays. In the town of Eeklo, Belgium, local workers used to eat a sandwich filled with butter and speculoos for breakfast: hence the idea of turning speculoos into a spreadable cream!
