instructions:
To prepare pumpkin in saor, first, make the Vegetable broth using our recipe, and keep it warm. Cut the pumpkin in half, remove the seeds and inner filaments , then peel the skin and slice the flesh .
Heat a little oil in a pan, then add the pumpkin and season with salt and pepper . Cook over medium heat for 2 minutes, then pour in a ladle of vegetable broth .
Cover with a lid and continue cooking over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, clean and thinly slice the onion . In another pan, pour a little oil along with the onions .
Add salt , bay leaf , and a ladle of vegetable broth . Let simmer over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes.
At this point, add the vinegar , sugar , and raisins .
Also add the pine nuts and half a ladle of vegetable broth . Stir and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, just enough time to let them dry .
Now transfer both the pumpkin and the onion into a baking dish, alternating the layers . Place in the refrigerator and let rest for 6 to 12 hours to allow the flavors to blend well.
After the resting time, plate and finish with chopped parsley . Your pumpkin in saor is ready to be enjoyed !
Pumpkin in saor can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 2-3 days.
If you prefer, you can replace the raisins with dried cranberries or chopped dried apricots, or you can add anchovies in oil to echo the original Venetian saor version.
