Peel and julienne both the apple (after removing the core) and the celeriac; since both tend to darken after being peeled and cut, immediately place them in a bowl where you've already mixed the Mayonnaise with vinegar (or the juice of one lemon), and blend everything well. Adjust the seasoning with salt and place the mixture on a serving plate, which, if you like, you can decorate all around with dollops of mayonnaise and walnut halves or a sprinkle of finely chopped chives.
Celeriac is a vegetable known mainly in northern Italy, especially in the Veneto region; it's also called Verona celery. Having a milder taste than stalk celery, it's often used as the main ingredient in gratin dishes, soufflés, etc...
With homemade mayonnaise, well, it's a different story! Once all the ingredients, including the celeriac and apple, are mixed, let them rest for at least half an hour before serving. 
As for storage, know that this delight can last a few days if you store it in the refrigerator, in a glass or plastic container with a lid or covered with plastic wrap.
