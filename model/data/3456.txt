To prepare the tower of stuffed ziti, start by cooking the ziti al dente and letting them cool. Prepare a Béchamel sauce with the quantities of ingredients listed above. Cut the slices of speck into julienne strips and toast them slightly in a pan without oil. Mix the toasted speck with the béchamel and set aside.
Even out the ziti and cut them all to the same length with the help of scissors. Put the fresh spreadable cheese in a bowl, add finely chopped chives and basil , and mix everything together. Use a pastry bag fitted with a small plain tip to fill the ziti with the prepared cream .
Take a baking dish and start assembling: place two tablespoons of béchamel with speck and arrange a layer of stuffed ziti side by side . On top of the ziti, place another layer of béchamel and Parmesan cheese . Finish with some pine nuts . Arrange more stuffed ziti on top of the béchamel in the opposite direction. Repeat the process until the ingredients are used up and a tower of ziti is created. Finish with grated Parmesan and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about fifteen minutes until the tower of stuffed ziti is well gratinated!
