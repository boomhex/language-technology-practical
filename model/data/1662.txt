Crunchy chocolate cups with mascarpone cream filling are a tasty, Italian-inspired treat that really, really brings fun and creamy flavor to your table without much fuss. Picture this: warm summer days in Italy—folks love a dessert that doesn’t need an oven. These chocolate dessert cups hit the mark. Seriously good. You use corn flakes for the shell—which adds a modern twist—something you wouldn’t find in traditional Italian desserts—but it’s way, way better for that crunchy texture.
The combo of crispy chocolate and the smooth, rich mascarpone filling? It’s a hit. Add toasted hazelnuts and the nutty taste just sings with the sweet chocolate and mellow, creamy cheese. And every bite is balanced and just so, so delightful. Plus, these are super easy to customize—try adding berries, cookie bits, or even a spoonful of jam to make it yours. Pretty much. In northern Italy, mascarpone shines in desserts like tiramisu, but here? And look, it takes on a new role in this mascarpone chocolate recipe .
The filling is extra moist and fluffy, thanks to whipped cream. It’s like eating a little cloud inside a crunchy shell. Which is great. This contrast is what makes these homemade chocolate cups so exciting—you get a bit of everything: crispy, creamy, and sweet. Kids love them as an after-school snack, and adults can toss in a dash of espresso powder or a splash of liqueur for a fancier touch.
These no-bake chocolate treats fit in perfectly at a picnic, a quick summer party, or just for enjoying on a hot afternoon when nobody wants to turn on the stove. And the sauce? To be honest, you end up with a super tender, tasty snack that feels special but comes together in hardly any time. It’s all about blending Italian flavors with a fresh, easy-going vibe. This captures the core of modern Italian desserts—mixing tradition with a playful twist, creating food that brings everyone together.
To prepare the crunchy chocolate cups with mascarpone cream, start by chopping the dark chocolate . Transfer it to a bowl or a bain-marie bowl and melt it in the microwave at low power in several intervals, or in a bain-marie. Then pour the corn flakes into a bowl , add the melted chocolate
and gently mix with a spatula without breaking the cereal . Then place the paper cups on a tray, stacking two on top of each other, so they are more rigid. Then transfer a little of the mixture into each cup and spread it both on the base and the edges using the back of a teaspoon . Repeat the same operation to create all 6 cups . Then transfer them to the refrigerator to set.
Meanwhile, take care of the filling cream: whip the cream with well-chilled whisks and bowl and set aside. Pour the creamy cheese into a bowl , then add the powdered sugar
and the vanilla essence . Then mix with a spatula until you get a smooth mixture .
Then add the chopped hazelnuts , the mascarpone , and mix again. Then add the whipped cream and mix from bottom to top to not deflate the mixture.
Once it is smooth and fluffy , transfer it to a piping bag with a star nozzle . As soon as the cups have solidified, take them out of the fridge
and fill them with the freshly prepared cream . Garnish with melted white chocolate , chopped hazelnuts
and place a whole hazelnut in the center of each cup (22-23). Do the same for all the other cups and serve them .
The filled cups can be stored for 1-2 days in the refrigerator.
Garnish the cups with raspberries or other red fruits!
