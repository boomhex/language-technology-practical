instructions:
To prepare the seared sea bream on carrot cream, start by peeling the ginger and finely chopping it . Peel the carrots and roughly chop them into chunks .
In a pan, let the oil infuse with the ginger and garlic , then add the carrots and cook over medium heat for about ten minutes. Once softened, remove the garlic and transfer the carrots to a jug .
Add the water , oil, and salt, then blend with an immersion blender until you get a smooth and homogeneous cream .
Set the cream aside and proceed to make the basil oil: blanch the basil leaves for a few seconds , then drain in ice water . Squeeze the leaves well .
Transfer them to a jug , then add the oil and blend with the immersion blender. Strain the mixture through a cheesecloth and set aside the basil oil obtained .
At this point, take the sea bream fillets, remove the bones, and cut each in half, keeping the skin on . In a very hot pan with a drizzle of oil, place the fillets skin side down and press them slightly with a spatula . Cook over medium-high heat until they start to turn white in the center, then season with salt .
You are ready to plate: spread the carrot cream on the bottom, then add the basil oil and place the sea bream fillet on top . Your seared sea bream on carrot cream is ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the seared sea bream on carrot cream immediately.
The carrot cream can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days, in an airtight container.
The basil oil can be stored in the refrigerator for a week, or it can be frozen.
The pungent note of ginger helps balance the sweetness of the carrots; if you prefer to replace it, however, you can deglaze the carrots with a splash of white wine vinegar.
