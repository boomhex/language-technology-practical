The upside-down peach cake is, no question, a beloved dessert in Italy. Especially during summer—when fresh fruit is everywhere. Really good stuff. This traditional treat? Pretty much a staple at family gatherings and casual dinners. The magic starts by placing slices of juicy peaches at the bottom of the pan. And here's the thing: they caramelize and become golden under a layer of homemade caramel. As it bakes, the peaches soak up the sweet syrup, while the sponge cake on top turns tender and soft. Super tender. Soft enough to break with a spoon.
This isn't just any cake—it is a peach upside-down cake that really really blends the heart of summer fruit with the simplicity of Italian baking. And you know what? Italians often create single-serve versions. Seriously good. Everyone enjoys their own little cake topped with caramelized fruit.
