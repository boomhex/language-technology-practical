instructions:
To prepare the Wiener Schnitzel, start by pouring the clarified butter into a low, wide pan , turn the heat to low and let it melt . Meanwhile, prepare three separate plates with breadcrumbs, flour, and beaten eggs .
Now take the veal loin and with a sharp knife cut two slices of about 1.18 inches (they will be about 8.8 oz each) . On the same cutting board, pound the veal slice with a meat mallet , moving from the center outwards, until you get a diameter of about 9 inches (it doesn't have to be perfectly round). The thickness will be about 0.2 inches .

Bread the cutlet starting by passing it in the flour , then in the egg and finally in the breadcrumbs . Press well with your fingers so that the breadcrumbs adhere well to the meat.
Increase the flame of the clarified butter which should reach 320°F (check with a kitchen thermometer). Immerse the cutlet in the clarified butter and let it fry for about 5 minutes, then gently turn it over with the help of tongs and let it cook for another 5 minutes .
When the cutlet has achieved the right golden color, it will be ready. Remove it from the pan with tongs and let the excess butter drain on frying paper . Salt it to your liking and serve the Wiener Schnitzel hot with a slice of lemon .
It is preferable to consume the Wiener Schnitzel immediately, but it can also be stored in the fridge for a couple of days.
To guarantee the typical taste of this cutlet, it is necessary to fry it in butter or lard; oil is not recommended.
