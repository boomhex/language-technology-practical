instructions:
To prepare the frittata with green beans in the air fryer, start by cleaning the green beans: wash them, trim them , and cut them into pieces . Cook them in plenty of salted boiling water for about 8 minutes , then drain and let them cool.
Crack the eggs into a bowl , add salt , pepper, and grated Parmigiano Reggiano .
Also add the chopped parsley and whisk everything , then add the now warm green beans .
Mix everything well . Now take a large baking dish, 22x22 cm (about 8.66x8.66 inches), we used a glass one that fits comfortably inside the air fryer basket, and brush it with a little oil . Pour the egg mixture inside .
At this point , place the dish into the air fryer basket (we used an air fryer with a capacity of about 6 quarts) and cook at 356°F (180°C) for about 20 minutes. Once cooked , wait a couple of minutes, then transfer the green bean frittata from the air fryer to a chopping board and serve!
The green bean frittata in the air fryer can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day.
If you wish, you can enrich the frittata with mint leaves or cubes of provola!
