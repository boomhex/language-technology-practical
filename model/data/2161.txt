instructions:
To make the fava bean and cheese sandwich, start with the How to Clean Fava Beans : remove the filament from the pod, open it gently to remove the fava beans and remove the outer skin , place the shelled fava beans in a bowl and season with salt, pepper, and olive oil , blend the fava beans with an immersion blender
to obtain a puree . Now toast the bread slices on a grill on one side only to make them just crispy . You will need 3 slices of bread for each sandwich. Also, slice the Pecorino thinly and remove the rind from each slice
drain the sundried tomatoes from the preservation oil and cut them into strips . Everything is ready for the assembly of the sandwiches: start with the first one: fill a slice of bread with half of the Pecorino, spread the fava bean cream on top
place half of the sundried tomatoes on top and close with another slice of bread , spread half of the burrata stracciatella on top , lay a few previously washed and dried salad leaves
season with a drizzle of oil and close with the third slice of bread . Your first fava bean and cheese sandwich is ready; finish the ingredients to prepare the second and share this genuine goodness outdoors !
