instructions:
To prepare the paprika fried prawns, first clean the prawns by removing their heads and shells . Use a toothpick to also remove the vein from the back . Once you have finished these operations, quickly rinse the prawns.
Take the stale bread, place it in a mixer, and chop it coarsely until you obtain crumbs . Transfer the bread to a bowl and season it with paprika and a pinch of salt . Mix well to combine the ingredients.
Beat the eggs in another bowl . Place the flour in a third bowl. Now take the first prawn: first pass it in the flour and then in the beaten egg .
Finally, pass it in the breadcrumbs , covering it well on both sides . Do the same for all the others and gradually transfer the breaded prawns to a tray lined with parchment paper. Transfer to the refrigerator for 10 minutes and in the meantime heat the oil. When it's hot, immerse a few pieces at a time .
Cook them for a couple of minutes, and when they are golden brown, drain them . Transfer to a plate lined with absorbent paper, add a pinch of salt , and serve immediately .
You can prepare the prawns a few hours before frying and keep them breaded in the refrigerator. Once cooked, we recommend consuming the fried prawns immediately.
Accompany the prawns with a sauce: yogurt, sweet and sour, or soy will do just fine!
