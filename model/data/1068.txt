instructions:
To prepare chickpeas with tomato, soak the chickpeas in cold water with a pinch of baking soda and leave them in water for at least twelve hours (the night before for the next day). Take the chickpeas, rinse them under running water , and cook them in a pot, covering them with water and adding a bay leaf .
Cook them like this for at least seventy minutes, or until they are cooked, fairly firm, and not mushy . In a separate pot, pour a drizzle of oil and sauté the garlic and the chili pepper .
and the aromatic herbs . Also add the peeled tomatoes, torn into pieces , and the tomato paste .
Mix everything well and add the well-drained chickpeas , keeping aside the cooking water. Salt and pepper to taste, increase the heat, and deglaze with red wine . Mix everything, add about two ladles of chickpea cooking water , and cook over low heat for about 20 minutes.
Before turning off the heat, remove the garlic clove and the herbs . The chickpeas with tomato are ready , serve them with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
Chickpeas with tomato can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 days. You can freeze them after cooking.
We recommend not skipping the tomato paste, which gives the dish an even more intense flavor.
You can add some fresh chopped parsley at the end of the preparation.
