With the recipe for mixed pasta with mantis shrimp and shrimp tails, we bring you into the fine dining of chef Daniel Canzian , who takes inspiration from typical ingredients of Italian culinary tradition, enhancing them with a touch of contemporary creativity. In the recipe we present here, a format of pasta from peasant cuisine is revived, originally born as an anti-waste necessity and perfect for absorbing the shellfish sauce.
