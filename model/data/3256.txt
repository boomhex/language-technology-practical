Discover the charm of Paste di Meliga , those classic little treats from the gorgeous Piedmont region, especially around Cuneo and Mondovì. And here's the thing, these traditional Piedmontese biscuits have a really interesting backstory. Way back when wheat prices soared, locals got creative and used fioretto corn flour instead. This switch gives each cookie a really good crunch while keeping the inside tender and moist—thanks to all the butter and eggs. I mean, the dough is soft and fluffy, so these cookies are light and never too heavy.
Often, you'll find these Italian cornmeal cookies paired with a glass of Moscato or Dolcetto d’Alba. And sometimes, they're served with zabaione—which is great—adding an extra layer of sweet richness. It's a perfect example of Italian baking using simple ingredients in really clever ways.
When you bite into a genuine Paste di Meliga cookie, you’ll notice a crumbly exterior with a buttery melt-in-your-mouth center. It totally sets it apart. The fioretto corn flour, which is finer than regular polenta, makes these cookies extra light and slightly sandy. And you know what? It's a good thing. Regional twists abound: some add a bit of lemon zest for a tangy twist, while others bake them longer for an extra golden and crisp finish. Seriously good.
Whether you're enjoying them at a local café in Piedmont or baking them at home, these cornmeal cookies hold local tradition. Sharing them with friends—especially alongside sweet wine or zabaione—pretty much captures the essence of Piedmontese desserts. Simple, genuine, welcoming. It’s no wonder these Paste di Meliga delights remain a staple at family tables. Year after year, they give everyone a taste of authentic Italian warmth and hospitality. So next time you crave something sweet, remember these really, really good cookies. Full of history and flavor. Bring a bit of Piedmont into your home.
