Panna cotta with agar agar? Oh yeah, it's a fun twist on the classic Italian dessert from Piedmont . Perfect if you're craving a dairy-free panna cotta or need something vegetarian-friendly. Thing is, instead of the usual gelatin, this version uses agar agar. It is a plant-based gelling agent from red algae, super handy for vegan panna cotta fans. And look, it’s totally free of animal products.
Now, agar agar needs thorough heating to activate. And so, it gives the texture a slightly more smooth and set feel. But it still keeps that creamy goodness. Really good stuff. Lining your cups with fresh strawberry slices? Super tasty idea. It not only looks fantastic but adds a burst of sweet fruitiness with each bite. For real, it creates a super refreshing vibe.

It melts in your mouth, that moist and delicate finish. Combined with fresh strawberries, it provides a light dessert that’s not too heavy.
Many Italians serve these at parties or casual gatherings. And it's an easy vegan dessert that looks fancy with little effort.

To make the strawberry panna cotta, start by washing the strawberries under plenty of fresh running water; slice about half of them , place them on a large enough plate side by side, sprinkle them with 20 g of sugar, and let them macerate . Pour the remaining strawberries into a blender with blades and add 30 g of sugar .
Blend the strawberries finely , then pass them through a sieve, using a spatula , to remove the seeds, then set the mixture aside .
In a pot, pour in the fresh cream along with the sugar and add the agar agar ; stirring with a whisk, bring to a boil and let it boil for about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the strawberry mixture you prepared .
Mix with the whisk until you get a homogeneous mixture. At this point, line 4 glasses with a capacity of 5 oz with the previously sliced strawberries and pour in the panna cotta, filling to the brim .
Place the glasses in the refrigerator for at least 3-4 hours. Afterwards, gently run the tip of a smooth knife along the edge of each glass and invert your strawberry panna cotta with agar agar onto the serving plate . Finally, decorate as desired with a strawberry and a mint leaf .
You can store the strawberry panna cotta with agar agar, wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 2-3 days in the refrigerator.
Prepare your strawberry panna cotta glasses with agar agar a day in advance to allow it to set well overnight!
