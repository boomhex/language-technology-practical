To prepare the quiche with escarole and diced ham, start by washing the escarole under running water , then roughly chop it . Clean and slice the leek .
In a large pan, pour a drizzle of oil, the whole peeled garlic clove (you can remove it at the end of cooking); also add the leek , let it wilt for a few minutes, then add the chopped escarole .
Cook it for about ten minutes with the lid on . Meanwhile, beat the eggs with a whisk , then add the milk
the grated provolone cheese and mix with a spatula to combine the ingredients . Add half of the diced ham to the mixture
and the escarole, mixing again ; salt and pepper to taste. Set the filling aside for a moment and take the puff pastry roll: roll it out slightly with the rolling pin , then roll it onto the rolling pin and unroll it onto the 11-inch diameter mold lined with parchment paper .
Make the pastry adhere to the edges, letting some of it hang over the side ; then gently pour the filling inside and distribute it evenly with the help of a fork .
Distribute the remaining diced ham on the surface , then fold the edges inward and bake the quiche in a static oven preheated to 355°F for 60 minutes (320°F for 50 minutes). Once cooked, take it out of the oven and let it cool slightly , then serve it!
You can store the quiche with escarole and diced ham in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. It can be frozen if you used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
If you prefer, you can replace the leek with onion and substitute the provolone with another cheese of your choice, such as a semi-aged caciotta!
