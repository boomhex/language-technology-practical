instructions:
To prepare salmon with apples, start with the apples. Wash them, cut them in half , and use a small knife to remove the core . Then slice the apples into not too thin slices
and cut each slice into three triangles . Take your salmon fillets and lay the apples on top . Take another small bowl and add paprika and turmeric powder (a pinch of each will suffice)
a pinch of salt and mix everything with a teaspoon . Lay the salmon fillets on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, slightly greased , and sprinkle with spices . Bake in a preheated static oven at 428°F for 20 minutes.
In the meantime, deal with the red cabbage: cut it finely , transfer it to a bowl and add the salt . Mix with a fork , wait 15-20 minutes,
then drain it from the liquid it will have released and rinse it under running water ; this step is to tenderize the cabbage. Transfer it again to a bowl and season with pepper and oil . It will not be necessary to add salt.
Remove the cooked and well-browned fillets ; arrange a bed of red cabbage on a serving plate and place the fillets on top , decorate with mint leaves and serve immediately .
It is recommended to consume the salmon with apples as soon as it is prepared; alternatively, you can store it for a maximum of one day in the refrigerator.
If you don't like red cabbage, you can replace it with grilled vegetables. Instead of turmeric, add a pinch of cinnamon, or for an even fresher note after placing the apples on the salmon, add a grating of lemon zest.
