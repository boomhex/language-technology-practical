melt it over low heat while stirring , then position the food thermometer inside the pan to control the temperature: the lard should not exceed 320°F. Then dry the fries perfectly , and once dry, immerse a few at a time in the 320°F lard (the temperature should not drop) .
Fry for a few minutes until the fries rise to the surface , then drain them on a tray lined with paper towels ; bring the hot lard to 356°F, then proceed with the second frying for a few minutes.
