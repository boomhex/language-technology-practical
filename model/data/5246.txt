Here's an original idea to present sausages for the Halloween party: transform them into "scary mummies"! Mummy sausages are tasty savory snacks for Halloween, simple and quick to make for your themed Halloween appetizers: just wrap each sausage with a strip of puff pastry, like the bandage of a real mummy, bake them in the oven, and decorate by creating eyes with two poppy seeds. And for a themed menu to prepare with your kids, how about tempting them with some pasta mummies ? Fun and taste guaranteed!
To prepare mummy sausages, start by taking a roll of ready-made puff pastry (or you can make it yourself by following the recipe clicking here ); cut it into 12 strips, about 3/8 inch wide, using a pastry wheel . Wrap each sausage with a strip of puff pastry, spiraling it around (leave the last part of the sausage uncovered, which will serve as the mummy's face) . Once all the sausages are "bandaged," place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper .
Separately, beat the egg yolk in a small bowl with a fork , add the milk , and brush the obtained mixture onto each mummy .
Bake everything at 350°F, in a preheated oven, for 40 minutes . As soon as the mummies are golden, turn off the oven, let them cool, then proceed to create the eyes: with a wooden skewer, make two holes on the uncovered part of the sausage and place a poppy seed in each hole . Your mummy sausages are ready: Happy Halloween!
You can store your mummy sausages in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to 24 hours.
If you like, you can brush the puff pastry strip with a little mustard before wrapping it around the sausage. With the leftover puff pastry, you can make some puff pastry pizzas , or some cheese puff pastry sticks .
