instructions:
To prepare the pork chops, pat them dry with paper towels , salt them generously , and set them aside for about ten minutes. In a high-sided pan, pour abundant and bring to a boil. Wash the potatoes and cut the larger ones into wedges without peeling them.
When the water boils, add the potatoes and cleaned onions . Salt to taste and cook for 5-8 minutes from boiling until they are soft, then drain them and set aside. In the same pan, heat the vegetable oil .
Pat the chops again as they will have released some water, then place them in the pan and leave them there for 3-4 minutes, then flip them to brown the other side as well . Once a nice crust has formed on both sides, add the butter in pieces .
Season with whole garlic , sprigs of thyme, rosemary, and sage leaves . Baste the chops by tilting the pan and drizzling them with the cooking liquid. Cook for a total of about 8-10 minutes (until reaching an internal temperature of about 150°F, as measured with a food thermometer) .
Once cooked, transfer them to a plate with the cooking liquid and the herbs. Cover with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes. In the same pan, add the potatoes and onions and let them brown for a few minutes.
Salt, pepper, and deglaze with brandy . Once the potatoes are nicely golden , serve them with the pork chops .
We recommend consuming the pork chops immediately. However, you can store the potato and onion side dish in the refrigerator for a couple of days. We do not recommend freezing.
We used new potatoes with thin skin, so it is not necessary to peel them.
