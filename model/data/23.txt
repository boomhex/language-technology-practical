Baked cheesecake with twaróg is something special, really. It's a dessert that's not quite like the usual cheesecakes you might know. Seriously good. In Ukraine, this treat has a unique texture and flavor thanks to twaróg . It's like Italian ricotta, but a bit more compact with a slight tang. This tang makes the cheesecake feel almost velvety—so so smooth. Unlike New York cheesecake, which is rich and dense, this version is softer. Pretty simple. Perfect for breakfast or a lazy afternoon snack.
The Polish cheesecake recipe shares some roots here, but the Ukrainian twist shines with the twaróg. And look, it makes the filling not just tender, but distinctively Eastern European. Some say this gives an authentic Polish cheesecake a different taste from what you'd find elsewhere.
Other types like Basque or Japanese versions are unique in their own ways, but the baked cheesecake with twaróg is really really different. People in Ukraine—and other Eastern European countries—love twaróg for many traditional desserts. This one ranks high. The subtle, sweet flavor and golden top are inviting, while the lightness keeps you reaching for another slice. Which is great.
It pairs beautifully with tea or coffee, but honestly, it is just as satisfying solo. Exploring traditional Polish cheesecake and Ukrainian sweets leads to discovering other cool recipes—like syrniki or pampushky—that use twaróg in different ways. For sure. This cheesecake isn't just delicious; it's a gateway into a world of Polish dessert recipes and Eastern European treats. Anyone curious about homemade cakes will love this tangy, creamy dessert. Always hits the spot. Whether you are a fan of classic cheesecakes or looking to try something new, the baked cheesecake with twaróg is sure to become a favorite. And you know what? You can't go wrong.

To prepare the baked cheesecake with tvorog, first, melt the butter and let it cool slightly. Pour the tvorog cheese, eggs , salt , and sugar into a large bowl.
Add the sour cream and cornstarch , then grate the lemon zest .
Finally, add the melted and slightly cooled butter and blend with the immersion blender until you get a homogeneous mixture .
Pour the mixture into a loaf pan measuring 10x4.3x2.8 inches lined with parchment paper and level the surface . Insert the syrup-soaked cherries in two evenly spaced rows, pressing slightly .
Finish by drizzling the cherries with their syrup and tap the pan on the work surface to remove any air bubbles . Bake the cheesecake on the middle shelf of a static oven for 60 minutes at 356°F, placing a container with hot water on the bottom of the oven to ensure the right humidity during baking. After the cooking time, slightly open the oven door and let the cheesecake cool completely inside before removing it from the mold . Once cooled, place the baked cheesecake with tvorog in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours before serving!
The baked cheesecake with tvorog can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days.
It can be frozen when baked, preferably in slices.
To make the baked cheesecake with tvorog even more delicious, you can glaze it with a drizzle of melted white chocolate, as we did!
If you prefer, you can replace the syrup-soaked cherries with berries or with raisins and chocolate chips, as in other delicious variants of this traditional dessert.
