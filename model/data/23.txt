instructions:
To prepare the asparagus and scampi risotto, start by cleaning the : detach the head from the body and set it aside, then use scissors to open the tail and extract the prawn meat, saving the tail with the head. Remove the intestine by pulling it with your fingers or using a toothpick.
Now prepare the broth: cut the vegetables into irregular chunks , heat a pot very well over high heat, add a drizzle of oil and add the shells and vegetables .
Sauté over high heat for about 5 minutes. When the shells have taken on a bright color, deglaze with white wine and let it evaporate, then add water to cover and let it simmer for about 10 minutes . Once done, strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into another small pot and keep it over low heat, as it will be used for cooking the risotto.
Cut the scampi into pieces about 1 cm . Sauté them briefly in a non-stick pan over high heat and then set them aside .
Clean the asparagus, remove the hard part of the stalk and peel the rest of the stem with a vegetable peeler, leaving the tip intact . Cut into slices about 2 mm thick and halve the tips .
Sauté the asparagus with a drizzle of oil in a high-sided saucepan that you will then use to cook the rice . Remove them from the saucepan and set them aside .
Keeping the heat on medium, add the rice and toast it for a few moments, then deglaze with a ladle of broth . Continue cooking using the broth to moisten the rice and after about 5 minutes, add the asparagus (saving some for plate decoration).
Salt, pepper, and continue cooking until the rice is ready. At this point, turn off the heat, add the scampi (saving some for plate decoration) and stir in the oil . If needed for stirring, you can add a little broth. Adjust salt and pepper, and your risotto is ready to be served, decorated with asparagus and scampi set aside, and a grind of pepper. Serve the asparagus and prawn risotto hot .
Store the risotto for 1-2 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended to avoid altering the dish's texture.
You can replace the asparagus with another delicate vegetable, such as zucchini or artichokes, which will give a more distinctive flavor. Do not throw away the asparagus cleaning scraps but use them to enrich a vegetable broth.
