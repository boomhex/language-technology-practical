instructions:
To make the seafood salad in jar cooking, first prepare all the ingredients you will need: remove the heads and shells from the shrimp , then cut along the back to remove the black vein inside . Take the already cleaned baby squid, separate them from the tentacles, and cut them into thin strips .
Now peel the carrot and slice it thinly on the diagonal , then cut each slice into 4 parts . Finally, clean the spring onion and slice it into thin rings, always on the diagonal .
At this point, you can assemble your jars (choose new jars suitable for jar cooking with airtight seals and rubber gaskets): place the shrimp at the bottom , then add the baby squid , the carrots ,
and the spring onion . Season each jar with a tablespoon of oil , salt, pepper, and some fresh thyme leaves .
and grated lemon zest . Close the jar tightly and cook in the microwave at a power of 450W for 3 minutes. Once ready, let it cool for a couple of minutes before opening: to open the jar, keep the lid, release the locks, and pull the rubber tab; serve your seafood salad in jar cooking !
