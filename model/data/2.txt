Egg white pancakes are a real game changer for breakfast lovers who want something lighter and healthier. These egg white pancakes are different because they use only the whites, giving you that fluffy, tender texture everyone craves, but without the extra calories and fat from the yolks. People often say they’re surprised by how moist and soft these turn out—even though you’re skipping most of the usual stuff. Really good stuff.
This easy twist on classic American pancakes is a go-to for anyone interested in healthy pancakes that don’t taste bland. Just a few basic things, and you’re set for a stack that feels a little lighter than usual. Whether you’re into working out, watching your diet, or just want to mix things up at breakfast, these pancakes fit right in. Pretty much.
People sometimes call them high protein pancakes because egg whites pack a solid protein punch without adding much else—making them super popular with athletes and anyone who likes to keep things healthy. It’s not uncommon to serve them with fresh fruit, honey drizzle, or maple syrup for a bit of sweetness. They go great with a dusting of cinnamon too. Really.
The pancakes come out golden on the outside and stay soft inside—which is kind of the best of both worlds. It's a pretty good easy pancake recipe for those mornings when you don’t want to fuss. You know? You can even mix things up—some folks add berries or a scoop of protein powder for more flavor. Plus, since they’re naturally low calorie pancakes , they work for anyone trying to keep breakfast light. So here's the thing: you don’t feel like you’re missing out, because every bite is fluffy and satisfying.
Whether you’re after new breakfast ideas or just want to change things up, egg white pancakes are a smart and tasty pick. Seriously good. They really make mornings better with their simple yet delicious appeal.

To prepare the egg white pancakes, pour the egg whites and sugar into a large bowl , then beat the mixture with electric whisks .
When the egg whites are stiff, add a pinch of salt , sifted flour , and vegetable oil . Blend the mixture again with the electric whisks until you get a rather thick batter.
At this point, pour in the milk in a steady stream while keeping the whisks running . After the milk has been fully absorbed, sift in the baking powder and mix one last time with the whisks to combine .
Heat a non-stick skillet with a dash of oil , removing any excess with a paper towel . Pour a ladle of batter into the center .
Cook over moderate heat for about 2 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface . Then, flip the pancake and cook the other side for another 2 minutes, or until golden brown . Continue in the same way until the batter is finished, stacking the pancakes on a plate; with these quantities, you'll get about 12 . Serve your egg white pancakes with maple syrup, honey, or fresh fruit as you like!
The egg white pancakes can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer, you can replace the vegetable oil in the pancake batter with the same amount of extra virgin olive oil or a knob of butter.
