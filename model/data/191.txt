instructions:
To prepare the fried corn on the cob, start with the corn cobs. We used pre-cooked ones, just cut them in half and then stick them in the center with a skewer , like a popsicle stick. Use a meat tenderizer to help with this operation because the central part of the cobs is quite hard. Move on to the breading: first pass them in flour .
Then in the beaten eggs and finally in breadcrumbs . Fry 1-2 pieces at a time in oil at 340°F for about 5-7 minutes .
Make sure they are well immersed in the oil and when they are beautifully golden , drain them on a tray lined with paper towels . Salt to taste.
While you fry the corn cobs, you can prepare the spicy sauce: pour the mayonnaise into a bowl and add the chili paste . Mix and transfer to a pastry bag .
For plating, place the corn cobs with the stick upwards, squeeze dollops of chili mayonnaise and garnish with arugula , dill, and chives. Your fried corn on the cobs are ready, enjoy them immediately !
It is recommended to consume the fried corn on the cob immediately.
As an alternative to the spicy mayonnaise, you can accompany the fried corn cobs with Greek yogurt flavored with lemon zest and juice, and maybe a touch of fresh mint!
