To prepare the quick Nutella cake, first pour the eggs and sugar into a bowl . Mix with a hand whisk , then add the milk gradually, continuing to mix .
Do the same with the vegetable oil . Add the Nutella and mix well, then add a pinch of salt .
Sift the flour and baking powder directly into the bowl and mix thoroughly to avoid lumps . Also, add the sifted cocoa powder .
Finally, sift the potato starch and mix one last time . Pour the batter into a 9-inch springform pan lined with parchment paper .
Level it and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 50 minutes. Check the baking with a toothpick, then remove from the oven and let it cool before transferring the cake to a serving plate . Proceed with the decoration: roughly chop the hazelnuts with a knife .
Spread the Nutella on the surface of the cake with a spatula , then sprinkle with the chopped hazelnuts . Your quick Nutella cake is ready to be enjoyed !
The quick Nutella cake can be stored at room temperature for 2-3 days, covered with a glass dome. It can be frozen but without decoration.
If you wish, you can flavor the batter with citrus zest or vanilla extract.
