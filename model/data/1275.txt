instructions:
To prepare the cranachan, pour the chilled fresh cream into a bowl along with the mascarpone and honey .
Whip the mixture with electric beaters , then add the whiskey and fold it in with a spatula .
Add 1.8 oz of raspberries, which you have washed and dried previously , and gently mix everything to combine . Heat a non-stick pan and toast the oats for about 3 minutes until golden .
Now you are ready to assemble the cranachan: take 4 clear glasses with a capacity of 6.8 oz and place some slightly crushed raspberries at the base , then add a layer of cream and a layer of toasted oats .
Repeat the layers by adding more raspberries and cream . Finally, decorate the surface with toasted oats, whole raspberries, and shortbread: after an hour of resting in the refrigerator, your cranachan is ready to be served !
Cranachan can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day. If you wish to prepare the cream in advance, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, without the raspberries.
If possible, choose cream with 48% fat content (double cream) or alternatively with 36-38% fat content (heavy cream): in this case, adding mascarpone won't be necessary. The whiskey must be strictly single malt, preferably of Scottish origin, while the oats can be used either as rolled oats or steel cut oats, though the latter is hard to find in Italy.
If you love the alcoholic aftertaste, you can let the oats marinate in whiskey overnight; alternatively, you can omit the whiskey to make it kid-friendly!
