instructions:
To prepare the potato, cheese, and ham terrines, first boil the potatoes in salted boiling water . Once they are soft, mash them with a potato masher in a large bowl, then add the cream .
Add the eggs , the Parmesan , and a sprinkle of nutmeg .
Continue with the thyme , adjust with salt and pepper and mix until you get a homogeneous mixture .
Slice the Emmentaler thinly . Butter 4 ramekins with a capacity of 170 ml (5.75 oz), with a diameter of 3 inches and 2 inches high . Fill them halfway with the potato mixture and level the surface. Place 3 slices of cheese in each terrine .
Continue with a slice of cooked ham , another 3 slices of Emmentaler and cover with another layer of the potato mixture .
Sprinkle the surface with Parmesan and finish with a few sprigs of thyme . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 25 minutes or until the mixture is well cooked and the surface is golden brown. Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly. Your potato, cheese, and ham terrines are ready to be enjoyed .
The potato, cheese, and ham terrines can be stored in the refrigerator in a closed container for up to 2 days.
For a stronger flavor, you can use Gorgonzola instead of Emmentaler. You can also replace the cooked ham with speck or bacon to add a smoky touch. If you love aromatic herbs, you can enrich the potato mixture with finely chopped chives or parsley.
