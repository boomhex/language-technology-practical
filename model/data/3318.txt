To prepare the puff pastry hearts, start by preheating the oven to 400°F, unroll the puff pastry and using a heart-shaped cutter, cut out 24 hearts, leaving 8 whole while cutting the remaining 16 with a smaller heart cutter (1-2). Stack two cut-out hearts on each solid heart, making sure to brush the surface of each layer to adhere well to the edges . Also, brush the final layer of puff pastry well and bake the hearts for about 10 minutes. Remove the puff pastry hearts from the oven and let them cool completely on a rack. It is now time to garnish your little hearts: here are our suggestions (the quantities indicated for each filling are sufficient for 4 little hearts).
For the ricotta and chocolate filling, beat the ricotta with the powdered sugar and the teaspoon of cream until you obtain a creamy mixture, at this point, add the chocolate shavings mixing well. Fill the little hearts with the ricotta and chocolate cream and cover them with chocolate shavings you have set aside.
For the cherry and chantilly filling, start by preparing the chantilly with the ingredients listed above and Chantilly cream for the procedure . Once ready, add 4 tablespoons of cherry syrup , continue to whip the cream , and fill the little hearts. To complete, cut cherries in half (or if you prefer leave them whole) and place them on each little heart to decorate. Happy Valentine's Day!
For convenience, you can decide to prepare the puff pastry hearts in advance and then store them raw in the freezer: place them in a box, separating them in layers with wax paper to prevent them from sticking together. When ready to use, just brush them with beaten egg and bake. With the remaining pastry scraps, you can make these delicious snacks. Brush the scraps with beaten egg and add poppy seeds, sesame seeds, oregano, or pink salt! Then bake them together with the vol-au-vents!
