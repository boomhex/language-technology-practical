To make the lasagna with vegetable confetti, start by cleaning the vegetables, then wash and trim the baby carrots , slice them , then wash the zucchini and slice them as well ,
wash and peel the potatoes and cut them into small cubes . Now take care of the pumpkin: cut it into wedges, remove the rind
and cut it into cubes like you did with the potatoes . In a saucepan, pour a drizzle of olive oil, add a garlic clove , chopped parsley, and the pumpkin ,
the potatoes , and the carrots, which require a longer cooking time , then moisten them with some Vegetable broth or hot water to continue cooking.
After 10 minutes, add the zucchini and continue cooking for another 5 minutes; it is important that the vegetables remain slightly crispy; otherwise, they might fall apart . Once cooked, turn off the heat and remove the garlic clove with kitchen tongs ,
finally, season with salt and pepper . Meanwhile, prepare the Parmigiano Cream , then in a small pot, melt the butter, add the flour and mix to get a roux . Then pour the hot milk into the roux
and stir the whole mixture, mixing well with the whisk and cooking over low heat. When it has thickened, remove the pot from the heat and add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano , thus obtaining a sort of creamy béchamel .
Start assembling the lasagna: in a rectangular baking dish measuring 8x12 inches, brush olive oil on the bottom and spread a layer of Parmesan cream , then take the thin sheets and place them in the dish side by side ,
cover with another layer of cream and at this point, fill with the previously cooked vegetables , and with the cheese cream , now cover with another layer of thin sheets,
one of vegetable ragout and one of Parmesan cream , continue alternating the layers until the ingredients are used up. Finish with a layer of vegetables and bake in a preheated static oven at 400°F for 12 minutes (or in a convection oven at 355°F for 10 minutes). Once cooked, take your lasagna with vegetable confetti out of the oven and enjoy them !
You can store lasagna with vegetable confetti in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container for 1-2 days. They can be prepared the day before, kept in the fridge covered with plastic wrap, and cooked the next day. They can be frozen, only if all fresh ingredients have been used, preferably uncooked: to cook them, simply defrost them in the fridge about 24 hours before and then bake them in the oven.
You can fill the lasagna with the seasonal vegetables available and with those you prefer: peas, peppers, mushrooms will work just fine. If you are looking for a stronger taste, as an alternative to béchamel, you can use a creamy taleggio sauce.
