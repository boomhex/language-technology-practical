To prepare the salmon pasta, first bring a pot of water to a boil for cooking the pasta and add salt once it boils. Cut the salmon into strips ; do not cut the salmon into too small pieces as they will break apart in the pan. Clean and finely chop the onion , then also chop the parsley .
Heat the oil in a pan and sauté the onion , then add the salmon and turn up the heat. After sautéing the salmon for a few minutes, deglaze with brandy and let it evaporate completely, then turn off the heat.
At this stage, the water should be boiling, so salt it and cook the tagliatelle for the time indicated on the package . Meanwhile, pour the cream into the pan with the salmon, keeping the heat off . When the tagliatelle is cooked, drain it and transfer it directly into the pan .
Relight the flame and stir everything well to reduce the sauce . Finish with chopped parsley and a grind of pepper , and serve your smoked salmon pasta immediately !
It's best to consume smoked salmon pasta immediately. Freezing is not recommended.
As an alternative to brandy, you can deglaze with white wine. The cream can be substituted with whole milk, and instead of parsley, you can use dill. Taste the sauce and adjust the salt if necessary, but keep in mind that the salmon should already make it quite savory! Salmon pasta is a tasty recipe, perfect even for an easy yet delicious holiday menu!
