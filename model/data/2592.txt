To prepare the chicken in soy sauce with steamed vegetables, start with the meat: from the whole chicken breast remove the central bone and the fattier parts, then cut into slices ; then remove the seeds from the chili pepper and cut it into strips , then grate the orange and lemon zest;
squeeze the orange juice and filter it. Then in a baking dish pour the soy sauce , extra virgin olive oil, and filtered orange juice
then add the zest of both the orange and the lemon ; continue with the chili pepper, marjoram, and sweet paprika ; mix the marinade and place the chicken breast fillets .
Sprinkle with peppercorns make sure all the fillets are covered in the marinade then cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to season. Meanwhile, in a steamer, pour the water, add the lemon sliced, peppercorns, and marjoram and bring to a boil.
In the meantime, prepare the vegetables to cook in steam: remove the trunk and outer leaves of the cauliflower and separate the florets from the main trunk ; rinse them under running water, then peel the baby carrots with a vegetable peeler leaving the green tuft intact; then trim the ends of the snow peas and rinse them under running water too.
When the water boils, place the steamer basket over the water and distribute the carrots and cauliflowers, then cook with the lid for at least 7-8 minutes: after this time also add the snow peas, slightly salt and pepper to taste, because the seasoning will be quite tasty already. Cook the vegetables for another 5-6 minutes; once ready, set them aside. Meanwhile, prepare the soy reduction: in a saucepan pour the honey and soy sauce ,
mix and let it reduce over low heat for 4-5 minutes . Then transfer the obtained sauce to a sauceboat to serve it later with the vegetables . Then drain the chicken breasts from the marinade ,
heat a cast iron grill well and grill the chicken breasts for 3-4 minutes on each side . Then on a serving plate place the chicken breasts and sprinkle them with black and white sesame seeds , then place the steamed vegetables alongside and serve with the soy sauce reduction !
Store the chicken in soy sauce with steamed vegetables in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 1-2 days. The soy reduction can also be stored in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 1-2 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of chicken, you can use turkey breasts and also season the meat with poppy seeds. While to flavor the marinade, you can use lime zest instead of lemon.
