instructions:
To prepare the madeleines, first melt the butter and let it cool slightly. In a bowl, pour in the flour and sugar , the baking powder , and the salt .
Flavor with grated lemon zest and bitter almond essence , then add the cooled melted butter .
Vigorously mix with a whisk to combine the mixture . At this point, add one egg at a time , mixing each time with the whisk to fully incorporate .
When you have obtained a smooth consistency , let the batter rest in the fridge for at least an hour , covered with plastic wrap. After this time, butter a madeleine mold and fill each cavity with half a tablespoon of batter , using another spoon to help it slide in.
Do not overfill the molds; otherwise, the batter will overflow during baking . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 13 minutes. Once golden, remove from the oven and invert the mold to release the madeleines. Let cool slightly and serve !
Madeleines can be stored at room temperature in a metal box for 2-3 days.
You can freeze them after baking.
If you prefer, you can flavor the madeleines with vanilla bean seeds or enrich them with chocolate chips. For a cocoa version, simply replace 20 g of flour with the same amount of unsweetened cocoa!
