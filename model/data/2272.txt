To prepare the grilled salmon with couscous salad, start with the vegetable broth that will be used to revive the pre-cooked couscous: wash the vegetables, then peel the carrot and trim it. Then cut it into pieces ; remove the green part and the beard of the leek, then cut it lengthwise and peel off the first layer
place the chopped vegetables in a large pot , add the peeled fresh ginger and the cardamom pods
the cinnamon stick , then the coarse salt and black peppercorns . Then add the water and let the broth cook for about 40 minutes over moderate heat.
In the meantime, prepare the vegetables for the couscous: Wash the bell pepper, cut it in half and remove the green part and the seeds inside ; then cut it into thin strips , then chop it finely .
Trim and peel the carrot, then cut it into strips, and chop it into small cubes as well . Wash and trim the green beans, then cut them into small pieces . Afterward, in a large pan, pour the sesame seed oil
and add the diced vegetables ; salt and pepper and sauté for a few minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally. They should soften without falling apart. Meanwhile, pour the pre-cooked couscous into a small bowl and when the vegetable broth is ready, strain it directly over the couscous .
Cover with cling film and let the couscous soak for about 2 minutes, just enough time to swell . Then spread it on a platter to fluff it up , then add it to the pan with the sautéed vegetables, with the heat off .
Also add the toasted and coarsely chopped pistachios and set aside. Move on to the salmon: remove any bones from the fillet ; then cut the salmon into fillets. Lightly brush each fillet with oil
then pepper to taste, and sear the Norwegian salmon fillets on a hot grill : five minutes of cooking in total will suffice, turning it halfway through to the other side . Once ready, serve the grilled salmon with vegetable couscous salad .
It is recommended to consume the grilled salmon with couscous salad as soon as it is ready.
The couscous can be stored for 1-2 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
For an even more aromatic dish, marinate the Norwegian salmon with oil, lemon juice, and honey before grilling. Snow peas, Taggiasca olives, and croutons can enrich your couscous!
The recommended couscous to water (or broth) ratio is 1:1, but it may vary depending on the type of couscous used, so we always recommend reading the instructions on the packaging.
