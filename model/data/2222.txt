Pommes Anna is one of those dishes where French cuisine really shines. Seriously, it takes simple ingredients and turns them into something golden and delicious. You stack thin layers of potato, press them together, and bake with lots of butter—plus a sprinkle of salt and pepper. What comes out is this classic French potato dish that’s crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. And those edges? Everyone wants to snag them from the pan.
There’s a reason this recipe has been around since the Napoleonic era—it’s got real history. Created by chef Adolphe Dugléré and named after Anna Deslions, who was quite famous, this layered potatoes recipe has become a sort of secret weapon in French cooking. Even though it skips the fancy stuff, it feels, you know, special.
In France, Pommes Anna is often a fancy dinner star, but it’s just as awesome at a regular family meal. How the butter melts and gives the potatoes that moist and crispy feel—kind of addictive. Some regions tweak the slice thickness or butter amount, but the main idea stays the same: thin slices, lots of butter, and a good bake. You get that golden color and almost melt-in-your-mouth center.
People call it a traditional French side dish or a crispy potato cake —and look, it goes with anything, from roast meats to a simple salad. It's not just about taste; it’s the elegance of simplicity. The result is always elegant and a bit sinful. It reminds you that sometimes the best food is about keeping it simple and letting the ingredients shine.
French food fans and potato lovers alike say, "This Pommes Anna is a must-try." Just to see how much magic can come from something so straightforward. Pretty much. Can’t go wrong with that.
To make Pommes Anna, start by peeling the potatoes , then slice them with a mandoline set to a thickness of 1/16–1/8 inch (you can also slice them with a knife to the indicated thickness). Place a pan suitable for oven cooking on the stove, melt 1.5 tablespoons of butter over moderate heat ,
then, still keeping the heat moderate, lay the potato slices on the bottom creating a concentric circle pattern: the potatoes should be very close to each other, slightly overlapping, so they adhere well to the bottom of the pan. Once the first layer is finished, season with pepper and salt to taste ;
Melt the remaining 3.5 tablespoons of butter, then distribute some over the first layer of potatoes with a teaspoon . Create another layer of potatoes and press them with a spatula
season again with salt and pepper and a little melted butter . Continue layering until all the potatoes and melted butter are used up, always seasoning with salt and pepper . Now turn off the heat and transfer the pan to a preheated static oven at 390°F for 30 minutes, (or in a convection oven at 355°F for 20 minutes) then switch to grill mode for 3 minutes or just enough time to brown the surface. Once cooked, take the pan out of the oven
cover with the serving plate and flip everything over ; the Pommes Anna will be well caramelized on the surface , serve them hot!
Pommes Anna can be stored in the fridge covered for 2-3 days. It is advisable to reheat them before serving.
Freezing is not recommended.
