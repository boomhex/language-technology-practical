instructions:
Lasagna with seitan ragu totally mixes that old-school comfort from Central Italy with a fresh, plant-based twist. It is both familiar and new, you know? In Lazio, lasagna's always been a hearty, family-style dish. The kind that fills the house with those rich, slow-cooked smells on a Sunday.
The switch to seitan gives the vegan lasagna a surprisingly tender bite. Really, it’s like the classic but with its own mellow flavor. Plus, it soaks up all the tomato sauce and herbs. You still get that moist and saucy layering everyone loves. Even skeptics at the table might be shocked at how the plant-based lasagna keeps all the tradition and comfort but leaves the meat behind.
Folks who know their ragù will catch that same cozy, savory feeling here. But honestly, it feels lighter, kind of making room for new ways to gather around the table. And the magic? Some people in Lazio say it's how it brings everyone together, and this seitan ragu version keeps that spirit strong.
Instead of heavy meat, seitan soaks up flavors from garlic, onions, and that slow-simmered tomato sauce. So, you end up with a golden top and crispy edges just like nonna’s—awesome, right?—but with a twist that works for vegetarians or anyone trying something different. It's a dish that really fits anywhere—special Sunday lunches, casual weeknights, or big gatherings—because it holds onto everything people love about traditional lasagna, just with a nod to today’s tastes.
Vegan lasagna like this shows you don’t have to lose any of that savory, nostalgic feeling, even if you swap out the meat. Whether you’re all-in on vegetarian food or just want to try something new, this approach to plant-based lasagna keeps the door open for everyone. Mixing old memories with new ideas, making sure nobody misses out on the good stuff. Add a fresh salad and some crusty bread, and look, you've got a meal that's both satisfying and inclusive, perfect for any occasion. It's a tasty reminder that embracing change doesn't mean leaving tradition behind. For real.
To prepare the seitan ragù, start by preparing the vegetables for the classic aromatic base. Peel the onion, celery, and carrot; cut them into large pieces . Place everything in a food processor and blend until you get a very fine mixture .
Heat the oil in a large pan and add the aromatic base . Let it sauté over low heat for at least 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is dry. Meanwhile, take care of the seitan. Insert it gradually into a meat grinder to obtain a mince . If you don't have a meat grinder, you can finely chop the seitan with a knife.
Add the seitan to the sautéed vegetables and let it brown for a few minutes, stirring often with a wooden spoon. At this point, deglaze with white wine and let it evaporate. Once the ragù is dry again
add the tomato purée , rinsing the bowl with a little water to collect all the purée and make the ragù a bit more moist . Mix well and add the tomato paste .
Continue cooking over low heat for 40 minutes, stirring often to prevent the ragù from sticking . Towards the end of cooking, add salt and pepper and mix well. The seitan ragù is ready .
Then proceed with preparing the béchamel: in a saucepan, heat the milk , flavoring it with nutmeg and a pinch of salt. In another pot, place the butter
And when it's melted, remove it from the heat and add the sifted flour . Stir vigorously with a whisk to obtain a lump-free mixture (the roux). Then put the pot back on the heat to lightly brown the mixture. Add the hot flavored milk and stir vigorously with the whisk ; let it thicken, cooking the béchamel over low heat for 5-6 minutes, stirring often.
It's time to assemble your lasagna! Take a 12x8 inch rectangular baking dish, spread some béchamel on the bottom and lay the egg lasagna sheets on top: 4 sheets, placed horizontally and slightly overlapping, to create a thick layer . Cover with a thin layer of béchamel ,
spread it well and then distribute the ragù on top in an even layer. Finally, distribute a little grated Grana Padano PDO , sprinkling it evenly. Cover with a second layer of lasagna, this time laying 3 sheets, in a vertical direction opposite to the first layer so that they are crossed .
Cover this layer with béchamel and continue with the ragù, the parmesan, and a new layer of lasagna placed horizontally. Continue like this, alternating ingredients and the direction of the egg lasagna layers, until you get 6 layers. Finish by sprinkling the last layer with plenty of parmesan , then bake the composed dish in a preheated static oven at 390°F for about 30 minutes (or in a fan oven at 355°F for 20-25 minutes), until the layers are soft and the parmesan crust is golden brown. Your lasagna with seitan ragù is ready to be enjoyed!
The seitan ragù can be stored in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for 2-3 days. You can freeze it (in the appropriate airtight containers) if you have only used fresh and not defrosted ingredients. You can store the lasagna with seitan ragù in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap, for 1-2 days. They can be prepared the day before, kept in the fridge covered with plastic wrap, and baked the next day. You can also freeze them if you have used fresh ingredients, better if uncooked: before cooking them according to the recipe, thaw them in the fridge about 24 hours before.
