To prepare the mini penne casserole with ham and mozzarella, start by preparing the Parmigiano Cream . Heat a small pot with the milk (it should just come to a simmer), while in another pan melt the butter over low heat and add the flour gradually . Stir vigorously with a hand whisk to obtain the roux. When it reaches a golden color, add the milk and mix it with the other ingredients while continuing to cook on low heat. When the béchamel thickens, remove from heat and gradually add the Parmesan to blend well, continuing to stir with the whisk. When the ingredients are fully combined, the Parmesan cream will be ready: set it aside.
Proceed with the other ingredients for the pasta: cut the cooked ham into slices about 0.4 inches thick , then into strips, and finally into cubes . Repeat the same with the mozzarella .
Now take a pot, pour in the water, and bring to a boil. Then add salt and cook the pasta . When it's al dente, transfer it to a large bowl with high sides and pour in the parmesan cream . Mix it well with the pasta and add the ham .
Then also add the mozzarella , salt , and pepper .
Flavor with finely chopped marjoram and mix the ingredients with a spatula . Then transfer the seasoned pasta to an 11-inch diameter baking dish , distributing it evenly.
Sprinkle with grated Grana cheese and bake in a static oven preheated to 392°F for 5 minutes, then switch to grill mode for an additional 2 minutes to create a light crust on the surface. Then remove from the oven , let it cool slightly to compact the ingredients, and serve your mini penne casserole with ham and mozzarella!
It is preferable to consume the mini penne casserole with ham and mozzarella as soon as it is ready. You can also store it in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to 2 days.
Furthermore, it can be frozen for up to 1 month.
