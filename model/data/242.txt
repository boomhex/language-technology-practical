instructions:
To prepare lactose-free crepes, first crack the eggs into a bowl, then add the coconut milk , the oil , and a pinch of salt .
Mix with a whisk . Add the flour and stir again to incorporate it evenly and obtain a smooth, lump-free mixture .
Heat an 18 cm (7-inch) crepe pan (or a non-stick pan of the same size) and lightly grease it with oil, then pour a ladle of batter into the center . Rotate the pan to distribute it evenly to the edges . Cook on medium-low heat for 2 minutes on each side. Continue this way until the batter is finished; with these quantities, you will get about 6 crepes. As the crepes cook, stack them on a plate or parchment paper. Fill the crepes as you like: for example, you can spread your favorite jam on half of the surface .
Fold the crepe in half and then in half again to form a triangle . Garnish with blueberries and sliced almonds .
Finally, finish with a dusting of powdered sugar and raspberries . Your lactose-free crepes are ready to be enjoyed !
Lactose-free crepes can be stored at room temperature, covered with plastic wrap, for 3 days.
As an alternative to coconut milk, you can use another type of vegetable milk.
