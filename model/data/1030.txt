Note + the soaking time of the dried mushrooms

instructions:
To prepare the chicken, start by soaking the dried mushrooms in warm water for about 20 minutes . Clean and finely chop the shallot and the garlic .
In a saucepan, pour the sauté and a swirl of oil , stew for about 7-8 minutes over low heat. Meanwhile, pour the flour into a baking dish and thoroughly coat the chicken pieces . When the shallot is stewed
also brown the chicken thighs on both sides . Deglaze with white wine and let the alcohol evaporate: it will only take a few moments. Add the seasonings ,
the well-drained mushrooms (do not discard the water, it will be used later) , then salt and pepper to taste. Strain and then use 1 1/4 cups of the mushroom soaking water . Cover with a lid and let cook for 50 minutes over low heat, occasionally turning the chicken thighs.
After the 50 minutes of cooking, remove the lid and continue cooking for another 10 minutes over low heat to let the sauce thicken. Then pour in the fresh liquid cream , stir and let cook for another 5 minutes. It should be very creamy . The chicken with mushrooms is ready, serve it hot .
Chicken with mushrooms can be stored in the fridge for 2-3 days or frozen after cooking if you've used fresh ingredients.
When the season allows, use fresh mushrooms; they will require a quicker cooking time with vegetable broth replacing the soaking water.
