instructions:
To prepare the steamed bao with wagyu ribs, first focus on the dough. In a jug, pour the warm water, add the salt , the oil , and mix until the salt is fully dissolved .
In the bowl of a stand mixer, place the flour, add the sugar , and the yeast . Start the machine and slowly pour in the water and oil mixture . Knead until the dough is elastic.
Remove the dough and shape it into a ball . In a bowl, pour a drizzle of oil , place the dough inside, and cover with plastic wrap . Let it rise for 2 hours in a dry place without drafts.
Meanwhile, finely chop the carrot , onion , and celery. Grate the orange zest .
Squeeze it to retrieve the juice . Salt the wagyu ribs . Pour oil into a pot .
Brown all sides of the ribs well , then remove the meat and add the vegetables for the sauté along with 2 cloves of unpeeled garlic . Sauté for 3 minutes .
Return the meat to the pot and add the orange juice , the grated zest , and deglaze with red wine .
Once all the alcohol has evaporated, cover with a lid and cook for 2 hours, turning the ribs occasionally . Meanwhile, take the dough and roll it out to form a sheet with a thickness of 0.2 inches .
With a pastry cutter of 4.7 inches in diameter, cut out discs . Close them in half-moons, placing a piece of parchment paper inside to prevent them from sticking. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes.
Once cooked, cut the ribs into pieces 0.8 inches thick and 3.9 inches long . Remove excess fat from the cooking base , then blend briefly .
Return the ribs to the cooking base and let them absorb the flavors well. Place the bao in the steamer , close the lid , and cook for 15 minutes.
Fill the bao with the ribs and complete with chives . Your bao with wagyu ribs are ready to be enjoyed !
The steamed bao with wagyu ribs should be consumed as soon as they are prepared. However, if there are any leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator in a closed container for up to 2 days.
If you prefer a lighter version, you can replace the wagyu ribs with chicken marinated in soy sauce and ginger, obtaining a filling with a more delicate but still aromatic taste. A vegetarian alternative could include a filling based on marinated tofu and sautéed vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage and shiitake mushrooms.
