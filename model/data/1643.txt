To prepare the eggplants and potatoes with almonds, first wash the eggplants and trim them . Then cut them into slices about 1/2 inch thick and from these, cut into cubes .
Place the eggplants in a colander, add a couple of tablespoons of salt, and mix. Let them drain for 30 minutes. At this point, peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes the same size as the eggplants .
Rinse the eggplants to remove excess salt and the liquid that has come out . Transfer to a baking dish. Also, rinse the potatoes to remove excess starch and add them to the eggplants. Season with oil
add salt , pepper, and a few basil leaves . Mix everything and bake in a preheated convection oven at 400°F for about 30 minutes, turning them occasionally to cook them evenly.
Meanwhile, place the toasted almonds in a mixer and chop them very coarsely . When there are about 5 minutes of cooking left, take out the eggplants and potatoes, turn them again ,
add the toasted almonds and drizzle with a little oil . Finish cooking, then take out and serve immediately .
You can also enjoy the vegetables at room temperature a few hours after cooking. Otherwise, you can store them in the refrigerator for a maximum of 1 day, in an airtight container.
Do not chop the almonds too finely. You can also use toasted pine nuts, walnuts, or hazelnuts.
