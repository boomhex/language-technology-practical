Filet mignon with Roquefort sauce is like one of those gourmet dinners that feels super fancy but, you know, it's pretty simple to make. The magic of filet mignon is how tender and mild it is. Seriously, it’s the cut people go for when they want something moist but not overly heavy. And the sauce? That bold, creamy blue cheese sauce made from Roquefort—it's a sheep’s milk cheese from France. Really. Roquefort's got these blue-green veins, kinda like gorgonzola, and it brings a tangy, rich kick that totally perks up the meat.
So here's the thing, the combo really shows off what makes French food famous: taking a simple piece of beef tenderloin and turning it into something special with a sauce that's both smooth and intense. You get that whole restaurant vibe at your own table, and look, it just takes a few good ingredients and not much fuss. For a special occasion dinner without hours of prep, this dish really really delivers. People in France have been doing this pan sauce thing for ages, and the way the Roquefort sauce melts over the juicy steak? It's just awesome.
Unlike big, bold marinades or heavy seasonings, this recipe is all about the natural flavor of the steak, letting the sauce add all the creamy and savory notes. And yeah, there are a bunch of ways people tweak this in different regions—some might use other blue cheeses if Roquefort’s hard to find—but honestly, nothing matches that classic French punch.
The end result? A classic steakhouse recipe that fits a date night, a celebration, or just when you wanna feel a bit fancy at home. It’s got that perfect mix: quick enough for a weeknight, yet impressive enough to make anyone think you went all-out. Really. Simple, elegant, and so so good with a side of crispy potatoes or a little salad, it’s the kind of meal that makes weeknights feel special. The pairing of filet mignon and Roquefort sauce really captures the core of French culinary tradition, making it a must-try for anyone who loves great steak.
To prepare the filet mignon with Roquefort sauce, take the fillet, clean it, trim the fat , and cut it into slices about 2 inches thick . Now tie each slice with white kitchen string: make two loops and secure the string with a double knot, cutting off the excess parts .
In a non-stick pan, melt the butter , add the fillets, season with a little salt (the sauce is very flavorful) and cook everything over moderate heat for about 6 minutes. After this time, turn the fillets to the other side and cook for another 6 minutes . When the fillets are ready, set them aside and cut the Roquefort into pieces .
In the same pan, add the cream and the cheese ; stir and continue cooking until the Roquefort has melted completely and you have obtained a creamy consistency. You are ready to plate: place a fillet on each plate, carefully removing the string, drizzle it with the sauce, and accompany it with fresh lamb's lettuce . The filet mignon with Roquefort sauce is ready, we recommend serving it still hot.
Store the filet mignon with Roquefort sauce in the refrigerator, sealed in an airtight container, for up to 1 day. We do not recommend freezing the filet mignon.
For very tender meat, it is advisable not to extend the cooking time too much as it could become dry. You can also choose to prepare the recipe with pork tenderloin.
