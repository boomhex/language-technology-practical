instructions:
To make the blueberry and pistachio cookies, first sift together the flour , baking soda , and salt in the same bowl.
Mix and set aside . Coarsely chop the pistachios and do the same with the white chocolate .
In a bowl, place the brown sugar and the room temperature butter cut into pieces and start mixing with electric beaters at low speed . Add the egg and, once incorporated,
proceed by adding the dry ingredients, in several batches . When you have a homogeneous mixture with a consistency similar to ice cream, stop the beaters and use a spatula to fold in the chopped white chocolate , the blueberries
and finally the pistachios . Mix everything with the spatula to combine the ingredients. Prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Using an ice cream scoop, gather a ball of dough at a time and place them well spaced on the baking sheet (15-16).
Bake the cookies in a preheated static oven at 300°F for about 25 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven , let them cool on a wire rack before enjoying them .
Blueberry and pistachio cookies can be stored in a tin box for a week.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you can't find raw brown sugar, you can replace it with granulated sugar plus a tablespoon of molasses. You can vary the nuts as you like: try also the version with white chocolate, chopped dried figs, and pecans!
