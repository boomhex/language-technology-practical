There are two ways to prepare buttermilk: the simple one requires the use of cream. Pour the fresh cream into a clean bowl, and with an electric mixer or a stand mixer equipped with whisks, begin to whip the cream , continue until the cream has "unwhipped" becoming solid , when you reach this point, it will mean that the milk and the fat part have separated . To achieve this result, you will need to whip the cream for about 20 minutes.
At this point, put the fat part in a fine-mesh sieve and press it with a spatula to extract all the liquid contained . Compact the fat part, in this way you will have obtained butter, while the remaining liquid is the buttermilk (5-6). With a package of 250ml fresh cream, you get about 3 oz of butter and 4 oz of buttermilk.
There is another version to prepare buttermilk at home, certainly simpler and faster, which can be a valid alternative to real buttermilk. Squeeze the lemon, being careful to filter out the seeds , pour the low-fat yogurt into a bowl, stir it with a hand whisk and add the skimmed milk and finally the lemon juice , mix well until you get a homogeneous mixture, let it rest for 10 minutes before adding it to your preparation!
The butter obtained through this process can be stored in the refrigerator for about 1 week or in the freezer for 2-3 weeks.
The most famous recipe using buttermilk is the Red Velvet Cake , but you can also use it in other sweet preparations by completely replacing the milk with the same amount of buttermilk. To learn more about butter preparation, watch the Cooking School How to make butter at home
