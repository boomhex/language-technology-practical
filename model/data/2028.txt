To prepare the sauteed hake bites, take the hake fillets and cut each fillet into 3 pieces, obtaining bite-sized pieces . Once you have cut all the fish, set it aside in the refrigerator while you prepare the seasoning. In a pan, pour the hazelnuts and toast them for 5-6 minutes over low heat . Once toasted, set them aside and let them cool.
Now move on to the seasoning: in a non-stick pan, melt the butter and add the sage leaves . Once the butter has melted, gently add the hake bites , then grate half of the lime zest .
Squeeze the lime and pour the juice into the pan and adjust with salt and pepper. Cook the hake over medium-high heat for 4-5 minutes, gently turning each piece with tongs . Once cooked, plate the hake bites by removing them from the pan with a spoon : do not pierce them with a fork or tongs, as they might break.
Place the hake bites on a serving plate, drizzling them with the cooking juices . At this point, take the toasted hazelnuts, now cooled, and chop them coarsely with a knife (11-12).
Sprinkle the chopped hazelnuts over the hake bites , finish with a final grating of lime zest , and serve : your sauteed hake bites are ready to be served!
It is recommended to consume the sauteed hake bites immediately, while hot. If any are left over, you can store them in the refrigerator in a sealed container or on a plate covered with plastic wrap for up to 1 day.
You can give a stronger flavor by replacing the hazelnuts with walnuts, also toasted and coarsely chopped. Do you have all the ingredients at home but no lime? No worries: lemon will do just as well, giving your hake bites a more delicate flavor.
