instructions:
To prepare Potage Parmentier, clean, wash, and coarsely chop the potatoes and slice the leeks. Sauté the leeks in a non-stick pan with 3 tablespoons of oil for a few minutes , then add a ladle of broth and let them wilt for 5-6 minutes .
Add the potatoes and cover the vegetables with the remaining broth . Season with salt and pepper and continue cooking over moderate heat until the potatoes become soft (it will take about 15-20 minutes, depending on the type of potato).
Once cooked, blend everything using an immersion blender , add the cream , and mix carefully to combine all the ingredients. Cook the soup for another 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and serve the Potage Parmentier while it is still hot, perhaps accompanying it with slices of toasted bread and a sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese.
You can store Potage Parmentier in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 2-3 days at most.
If you wish, you can substitute the cream with milk. If you don't have an immersion blender, you can use a food mill. For this preparation, it is recommended to use dry and floury white or yellow potatoes.
