instructions:
The plaice fillets with honey and aromatic herbs are a quick and easy second course that is both simple and refined. The honey, which will caramelize the fish, combined with the aromatic bouquet of spices, will create a dish with a delicate, fragrant, and flavorful taste at the same time.
To prepare the plaice fillets with honey and aromatic herbs, start by halving the garlic and finely chopping sage, myrtle, and rosemary .  Put the butter and oil in a non-stick pan, then when they are hot, add the halved garlic and the aromatic herbs and let them flavor the oil for a minute. Then remove the garlic and add the plaice fillets to the pan, browning them on both sides .
Then add the two tablespoons of honey and let caramelize for a minute and add the aromatic herbs . If the plaice looks dry, add a ladle of vegetable broth. Turn off the heat, adjust the salt, sprinkle with freshly ground pepper, distribute the chopped parsley over the fillets, and serve immediately .
You can also make this recipe with other fish fillets, such as perch or similar.
