The Greek quinoa salad is a rich and genuine summer main dish that will color your table with flavor. Inspired by Hellenic cuisine, we have enriched the quinoa with feta, Greek olives, and red onions to recreate the scents and flavors of the traditional Greek salad. The specialty of this dish will be the red quinoa, a versatile pseudo-cereal that is delicious and worth discovering!
Let yourself be tempted by these tasty variants:
To prepare the Greek quinoa salad, start by cooking the red quinoa. In a pan, pour a splash of olive oil . Add the red quinoa and toast it for a few minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour in the water, fully covering the quinoa.
Salt and cook the quinoa with a lid for 25 minutes (unless otherwise indicated on the package) until the quinoa has completely absorbed the water . Then transfer it to a bowl to cool .
Cut the feta into cubes . Thinly slice the onion . Wash the tomatoes and cut them in half or into smaller pieces .
Wash and trim the ends off the cucumber, then use a mandoline to slice it thinly . Add the feta and vegetables to the quinoa. Also, add the pitted black olives and the fresh mint, torn into pieces.
Mix and dress with a drizzle of olive oil . The Greek quinoa salad is ready to be served .
The Greek quinoa salad can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
