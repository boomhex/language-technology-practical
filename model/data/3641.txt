instructions:
To prepare the oatmeal cookies, start by grinding half of the oats (5 oz) with the almonds . Once ground smoothly , add the softened butter .
After grinding everything , when the butter is well distributed, remove the obtained mixture from the processor and place it in a large bowl. Now add the sugar , baking powder ,
one whole egg and one yolk , the grated zest of a lemon , and a teaspoon of cinnamon .
At this point, add the remaining oats (those not ground) and mix all the ingredients well with your hands . When you have obtained a homogeneous mixture , cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes .
When the dough has reached the right consistency (it should be quite firm), divide it into many small parts, each weighing 0.5 oz. With wet hands, make many small balls and place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, ensuring there is enough space between each ball as they will spread and expand during baking . Bake at 350°F for 20 minutes (if using a fan oven, 320°F for about 15 minutes), then remove the oatmeal cookies from the oven as soon as they are golden brown . Your oatmeal cookies are ready!
Oatmeal cookies can be stored in a glass jar for 1 week, in a cool and dry place. The oatmeal cookie dough can be frozen before baking.
Make your oatmeal cookies special by adding dried red fruits or chocolate chips!
