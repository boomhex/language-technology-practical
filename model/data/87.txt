instructions:
To prepare the pumpkin cutlet burger, start by cleaning the cabbage: remove the outer leaves, then thinly slice it into strips . Transfer the cabbage to a bowl and dress with oil and vinegar .
Add a pinch of salt , mix and set aside . Move on to the Mayonnaise with Immersion Blender : pour the egg and oil into a jug .
Add the vinegar as well and activate the immersion blender until you achieve mayonnaise consistency . Add finely chopped sage .
Mix and store in the refrigerator . Now focus on the cutlets: trim the pumpkin , cut slices about 0.6 inches thick and remove the skin; you will need about 500 grams (about 1.1 lbs) of cleaned pumpkin.
Dip the pumpkin slices first in flour , then in beaten eggs and finally in breadcrumbs .
Immerse one cutlet at a time in hot oil at 329°F-338°F and fry for a couple of minutes; when they are nicely golden, drain on absorbent paper . You are ready to assemble your sandwich: spread some mayonnaise on the bottom half of the sandwich bun ,
Place the cutlet on top , then add a handful of marinated and well-squeezed cabbage . Close with the other half of the bun on which you have spread a little more mayonnaise and your pumpkin cutlet sandwich is ready !
It's recommended to consume the pumpkin cutlet sandwich right away.
If you prefer, you can replace the red cabbage with sautéed bitter greens, chicory, or turnip greens.
