Pane intrecciato ripieno is this stuffed braided bread that's basically a superstar at any gathering or family meal. Originating from Liguria on Italy’s northwest coast, it captures that coastal Italian vibe in every bite. Really, it’s all about rustic charm and hearty fillings. Think layers of tender dough—fragrant and warm—hugging a delicious filling. Inside, you’ll find a really, really good mix of creamy cheeses, moist peas, and diced mortadella adding a savory touch. Some folks in Liguria throw in a Genoese twist with homemade pesto, which is great for a tangy and fresh kick. And listen, the sprinkle of crunchy pistachios gives it a crispy texture and a hint of sweetness, setting it apart from just any bread.
So here's the thing: This filled bread recipe is a must at holiday tables, picnics, or when you crave something more exciting than plain bread. It's a versatile savory bread recipe —slice it into big chunks for a soft, hearty appetizer, or pull it apart to share at a laid-back dinner. And look, people love how the cheese gets all melty, blending with the sweet peas and salty mortadella, creating a blend of flavors and textures. The Genoese pesto version? A must-try if you’re into that herby, garlicky punch Liguria is famous for.
Traditional bread baking techniques like braiding give it a classic look, but honestly, the real magic happens as the fillings soak into the bread while baking, making everything extra moist and flavorful. Whether you're playing with new flavors or hunting for an easy bread recipe that feels special, this Italian favorite is always a crowd-pleaser. Plus, it offers a really good way to dive into Liguria’s rich culinary traditions, bringing a taste of Italy to your table without needing fancy ingredients or complex techniques. It's an experience that makes every meal feel a bit more special, no question.
To prepare the stuffed braided bread, start with the starter: in a small bowl, pour the dry yeast (or 9 g of fresh brewer's yeast) into the warm water . Stir with a teaspoon to dissolve it, then add the malt (or sugar) and mix it with the ingredients. Pour the mixture into a bowl where you have collected the sifted Manitoba flour .
Knead everything directly in the bowl until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough that you can let rise covered with plastic wrap for 1 hour, in the oven off with the light on (it should double its volume). In the meantime, you can prepare the peas that will go into the filling: cook them for 10 minutes in a pan with a drizzle of oil and a clove of garlic ;
season them with chopped thyme , salt, and pepper. Add a little water to facilitate cooking and let them stew for about ten minutes. Then, focus on the braided bread dough: in a bowl, beat the egg yolks with a hand whisk ;
add the warm water , work again with the whisk , then also pour in the cheese and mix it with the other ingredients .
Then pour the obtained mixture into the stand mixer where you have poured the sifted flour . Turn on the paddle attachment to knead everything . When all the ingredients are combined, remove the paddle and use the hook, then start adding the room temperature butter, cut into pieces , a little at a time, allowing the dough time to absorb it.
Continue kneading until the butter is completely incorporated and the dough is homogeneous. Then take the starter, which will have doubled in volume, and add it to the dough, piece by piece ; keep the stand mixer running until the starter is fully incorporated. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead it until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough. Place the dough in a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap ; let it rise in the oven off with the light on for 2 hours until the dough doubles in volume.
At this point, prepare the rest of the filling for the braided bread: cut the mortadella slices into cubes , making sure to remove the outer casing. Take the Fontal cheese, remove the rind, and cut it into cubes ; then take the bread dough, which will have doubled in volume ,
divide it into two equal parts and roll them out into two rectangles of 18x12 inches with a thickness of 1/5 inch. Brush the surface with a beaten egg ;
then fill the two rectangles with cheese, peas , the diced mortadella, and the Tilsit cheese cubes . Start rolling the rectangles from the longest side, trying to tighten them as much as possible to prevent the filling from coming out . Roll until you get two rolls.
Join them at one of the two ends and braid them together , then seal the other end well .
Brush the surface with the remaining egg and sprinkle with pistachio crumbs . Bake the braided bread in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 40 minutes (320°F for about 30 minutes if fan-assisted). Once cooked, remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving it sliced!
Store the stuffed braided bread in a food bag or under a glass dome. You can freeze the stuffed bread and thaw it in the fridge; bring it back to room temperature before cooking. The dough alone can also be frozen after the second rise, thaw it in the fridge when needed and bring it back to room temperature.
Choose the vegetables you prefer for the filling, such as diced zucchini, and instead of ham, you can fill it with diced cooked ham or other cold cuts to your liking!
