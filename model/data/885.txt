To prepare the crepes with pumpkin, speck, and walnuts, start with the batter. Boil the spinach in a little salted boiling water for 3 minutes , then drain them and place them in ice water. Squeeze them, transfer them to a blender cup, and blend them with the milk .
Melt the butter over very low heat and let it cool. Sift the flour into a bowl, add the eggs and mix well with a whisk. Add the melted butter , the milk and spinach mixture , and salt. Let the batter rest in the refrigerator for half an hour.
Finely chop the shallot and dice the pumpkin . Sauté the shallot in a non-stick pan with a bit of oil. Add the pumpkin , season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Let it cook until the pumpkin cubes become soft, adding a few tablespoons of water if necessary. When cooked, mash it with a fork and set it aside. Cut the speck into strips and keep a third aside.
Cook the crepes by lightly buttering the non-stick pan. Flip them only once as soon as they detach from the pan. Now assemble them: put a spoonful of pumpkin cream on each crepe, some speck, coarsely chopped walnuts, and diced scamorza cheese . Fold two edges inwards and roll them up. Transfer the crepes to a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake for 10-12 minutes in a preheated static oven at 356°F.
Meanwhile, prepare the cheese fondue with the grated cheese and milk. Cook it over medium heat for 4 minutes , until it becomes smooth. In a pan, also sauté the remaining speck . Remove the filled green crepes from the oven, pour the fondue over them , the crispy speck, and some crumbled walnut halves. Serve the crepes hot!
You can store the crepes in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 days.
Instead of all-purpose flour, you can use the same amount of cake flour to make the crepes.
If you prefer, you can also toast the speck strips in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 5 minutes.
