instructions:
To prepare the pasta with pea cream and guanciale, start with the latter. First, cut it into slices , then cut these into thin strips . Then add the guanciale to a hot pan ,
and let it cook for 5 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally . In the meantime, remove the outer part of the leek and cut it into rings . When the guanciale is golden brown, drain it .
Transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels and set it aside. In the same pan, add the sliced leek and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes until wilted and golden. Place a pot of salted water on the stove, which will be used for cooking the pasta. As soon as it starts to boil, add the peas and let them cook for a couple of minutes.
Using a slotted spoon, remove the peas and immerse them in a bowl of very cold water . Keep the pot with the water aside; it will be used for cooking the pasta. Drain the peas again ; set aside 1/3 and pour the others into a tall container .
Add the sautéed leek , a ladle of cooking water , and blend with an immersion blender until you get a cream.
Add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil to the cream , mix and set aside. Bring the water back to a boil and add the pasta . Meanwhile, pour the pea and leek cream into the pan, add a ladle of cooking water ,
season with salt and add some black pepper . When the pasta is al dente, drain it and add it to the pan . Add the crispy guanciale, keeping some aside for decoration .
Add the remaining peas and sauté the pasta for a couple of minutes over medium heat . Plate it and decorate with the crispy guanciale , then serve immediately!
You can store this pasta in the refrigerator for up to one day.
You can add fresh cheese or grated pecorino to the pea cream once you've plated it!
