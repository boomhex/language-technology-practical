To prepare the smoked salmon canapés, first finely chop the chives . Put the cream cheese in a bowl, soften it with a whisk , and add the lime zest .
Add the chives and mix. Pour in the oil and mix again .
Adjust the salt and mix one last time. Place the mixture in a piping bag with a tip of your choice , we used a fluted one. Let the cream rest in the fridge until ready to use. Cut the sandwich bread with a 2-inch diameter cookie cutter , you'll get 12 pieces. Cut the smoked salmon slices into strips.
Top each bread disc with a generous dollop of the cheese mixture , lay the salmon on top , and garnish with black sesame seeds .
Finish with some chives . Once ready , arrange them on a serving plate . Your smoked salmon canapés are ready to be served!
Smoked salmon canapés should be consumed immediately to preserve their texture and flavor. You can prepare them up to an hour in advance but must cover them with plastic wrap and store them in the refrigerator.
For a gourmet touch, you can add some salmon roe and a grating of fresh horseradish as a garnish. If you want a crunchy texture, you can brush the bread discs with a little oil and bake them in a preheated static oven at 320°F for 10 minutes, just until they are golden. Wait for the bread discs to cool and become crispy before filling them.
