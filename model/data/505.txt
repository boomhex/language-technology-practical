instructions:
To prepare the upside-down peach cakes, butter a 12-muffin pan. Pour the brown sugar inside and the butter in cubes . Then place the pan at the bottom of the oven and let it cook at 356°F for a few minutes until you get caramel . Let it cool slightly.
Meanwhile, dice 2 peaches . Meanwhile, in a bowl, add the butter, vanilla extract , and sugar .
Beat with electric whisks for a few minutes. Gradually add the eggs to the light and frothy mixture . Get an even fluffier mass and then incorporate sifted flour and baking powder .
Finally, pour the milk in a stream . Turn off the whisks and gently incorporate the almond flour and diced peaches .
Mix to combine . Cut the remaining peaches into thin slices . Place two slices in each portion .
Transfer the mixture into the pan and bake in a static oven at 356°F for about 30 minutes . Run the back of a knife inside the spaces while the pan is still hot and flip it over using a wire rack. Tap decisively to release them. Before serving, accompany with a few mint leaves .
The upside-down peach cakes can be stored for a couple of days under a glass dome.
Instead of vanilla, flavor with lemon zest and also squeeze the juice of half to flavor the mixture. If you're in the mood for a particular combination, you can add a few sprigs of thyme or finely chopped rosemary to the dough. Finally, for a truly indulgent accompaniment, serve with a scoop of custard or vanilla ice cream.
