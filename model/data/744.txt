instructions:
To make the radicchio rolls with champignon mushrooms and Superior Bergkase, first prepare the ingredients: clean the mushrooms and slice them very thinly , then peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes about 1/2 inch . Finally, chop the parsley .
In a pan, sauté the garlic with the oil for a few minutes, then add the potatoes , salt , and cook for at least 7-8 minutes. At this point, add the mushrooms and cook for another 4-5 minutes.
When the filling is cooked, remove the garlic and add the chopped parsley , then turn off the heat and let it cool slightly .
In the meantime, grate the Superior Bergkase with a coarse grater . Add the grated cheese to the slightly cooled filling , mix well, and set aside .
Move on to the radicchio: choose the longest leaves and remove the tougher central rib . Blanch the leaves for about 30 seconds , then transfer them to a bowl with cold water and ice .
You are ready to assemble the rolls: place the radicchio leaves on a cutting board and add a tablespoon of filling , then gently fold the sides and roll the leaf carefully . Arrange the obtained rolls in an oiled baking dish .
Finally, grate the Superior Bergkase for the gratin, this time with a fine grater . Dust the rolls with the cheese and bake for 5 minutes with the grill at 464°F . Once gratinated, the radicchio rolls with champignon mushrooms and Superior Bergkase are ready to be served hot !
The radicchio rolls with champignon mushrooms and Superior Bergkase can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days in an airtight container.
If you prefer, you can use another type of mushrooms.
