instructions:
Soak the black beans for 12 hours in cold water (do this the night before preparation and leave them to soak overnight). Rinse the beans and drain them. In a pot, add the oil, the chili (whole or in pieces), the chopped onion and garlic, the whole piece of smoked bacon, and the bay leaf; sauté everything over low heat and then add the diced tomato, cinnamon, and finally the black beans.
Add the chicken broth and cook for about 45 minutes on low heat, covering the pot with a lid and leaving a small vent. Once the beans are cooked, adjust the salt and pepper and serve the Mexican black bean soup, accompanying it with the tortillas which you can find on our site by consulting the Flour tortillas page.
You can serve the Mexican black bean soup garnished with chopped fresh cilantro leaves.
