Ricotta is a very versatile ingredient, but for once, we thought of making it the absolute star of a vegetarian main course : baked ricotta! An easy and quick idea to prepare, enriched with cherry tomatoes and red onion... few but good ingredients, as they say, enhanced by the aroma of herbs and good extra virgin olive oil. A mix of Mediterranean flavors that we invite you to try even in the variant with Baked Feta ! Perfect for a light and different dinner, baked ricotta is also ideal to serve as an appetizer.
Here are other baked ricotta recipes:
To make baked ricotta, first let the ricotta drain in a colander for about ten minutes. Meanwhile, clean the onion and slice it thinly . Line a baking dish with parchment paper, distribute the onions at the bottom, and place the ricotta in the center , then add the whole cherry tomatoes .
Season with salt and oil , then sprinkle everything with breadcrumbs . Make a cross cut on the surface of the ricotta: this way the seasoning will penetrate inside .
Finally, flavor with some sprigs of rosemary and thyme. Add a bit of pepper and another drizzle of oil, then bake in a preheated static oven at 400°F for about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve your baked ricotta immediately !
It is recommended to consume the baked ricotta as soon as it is ready.
If you wish, you can enrich the baked ricotta with black olives!
As an alternative to thyme and rosemary, you can use basil leaves.
