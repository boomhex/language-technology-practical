instructions:
To prepare the zucchini and sausage bites, first cut the sausage lengthwise with a knife , remove the casing and chop it . Place the crumbled sausage in a hot non-stick pan, without adding fats, and cook for a couple of minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon .
When the sausage is cooked, transfer it to a bowl and let it cool. Meanwhile, wash and dry the zucchini, then grate them with a large-holed grater and set them aside .
Crack the egg into a bowl, pour in the milk and the vegetable oil and quickly whisk, then add the flour and continue to mix until it is well blended .
Add the baking powder and incorporate it into the mixture using a spatula , then add the grated zucchini and mix well to combine everything.
Finally add the salt and the sausage and mix until you get a thick and homogeneous mixture .
At this point, butter a mini muffin tin and fill the molds with a spoonful of the mixture: with this dose you should fill about 19-20 molds . Bake in a preheated ventilated oven at 356°F for about 20 minutes, placing the tin on the bottom shelf. Once cooked, your zucchini and sausage bites are ready to be enjoyed !
The zucchini and sausage bites can be stored at room temperature, in an airtight container, for 1-2 days. You can freeze them after cooking and cooling if you have used only fresh, not defrosted, ingredients.
If you wish, you can flavor the bite mixture with a few thyme leaves.
