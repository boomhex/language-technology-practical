You can store foolproof dough in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, well wrapped in plastic wrap.
You can enrich the foolproof dough with poppy seeds, fennel seeds, or even cumin seeds to make it more unique. If you don't want to use only wine, you can split the amount in half and use 100 g of water and 100 g of wine. For this preparation, it is recommended to use a very thin sheet.
