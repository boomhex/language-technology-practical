instructions:
To make the delicious churros, start with the dough: in a saucepan, pour the water, vegetable oil , and salt , and bring it to a simmer. Meanwhile, sift the flour separately. As soon as the water comes to a simmer, remove the saucepan from the heat and add the flour all at once .
Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon to obtain a solid and consistent mixture , then return the saucepan to the heat and continue stirring for at least 3 minutes over medium heat until a white film forms on the bottom . At this point, pour the mixture into a bowl and spread it on the sides with the help of the wooden spoon so it cools faster . Let it cool for 10 minutes.
When the mixture has cooled, add the previously beaten egg and mix vigorously to incorporate it until the dough is smooth, compact, and homogeneous . Transfer the obtained dough into a pastry bag with a medium-sized star nozzle (we used a 0.6 inch one) .
Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot to a temperature of 356°F, then squeeze the dough directly into the oil, cutting it to a length of about 4 inches with the help of a knife . Fry the churros for about 3-5 minutes, turning them often so that they brown evenly on all sides, then drain them and transfer them to paper towels to remove excess oil .
Meanwhile, mix the granulated sugar with the cinnamon (if you like) . Pass the hot delicious churros in the flavored sugar and cover them entirely . Your delicious churros are ready to be enjoyed with a cup of hot chocolate !
It is recommended to consume the delicious churros as soon as they're ready.
Not only chocolate: delicious churros are also fantastic on their own or accompanied by caramel sauce!
