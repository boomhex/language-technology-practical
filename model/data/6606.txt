You can also try:

Start by cleaning the mussels. First make sure they are all closed: discard those that are broken or open. Then remove any barnacles with a small knife and pull out the hairy beard that may stick out of the shell. Finally, scrape off the impurities with a clean scourer or stiff brush .
Rinse them thoroughly and move to the stove . Heat a very large pot, put in the mussels and add the black pepper immediately (it is better to grind the pepper when needed, as you will obtain a more aromatic and intense taste) .
Close with the lid and let the mussels completely open. Occasionally shake the pot to stir. It will take 3-4 minutes . At the end of cooking, remove the lid and place lemon slices and chopped parsley on serving plates. Your peppered mussels are ready: enjoy your meal !
Storage is not recommended.
If you prefer, you can add a few tomatoes to the mussels and enjoy a delicious sauce!
