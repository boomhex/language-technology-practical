To prepare the Christmas canapés, first, place the 5 slices of sandwich bread on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut out 4 rectangles lengthwise ; then divide each rectangle in half .
This way, you will get 8 square canapés from each slice of bread to fill with each flavor; for a total of 40 canapés. Start by assembling the first 8 tuna and pickled vegetable canapés. To do this, place the tuna in a bowl and mash it with the back of a spoon .
Add the mayonnaise and mix until you get a smooth and creamy sauce . Spread the mixture on each canapé .
Decorate by alternating pieces of pickled vegetables for added color and crunch. Complete with a pinch of finely chopped chives . Set aside these 8 canapés and prepare the anchovy ones. Combine the anchovy paste with the spreadable cheese in a bowl .
Work the mixture with a spoon until you get a uniform cream . With a spatula, spread the anchovy cream evenly over another 8 canapés. Place the drained anchovy fillets in the center .
Continue with a light grating of fresh lemon zest , which will give an aromatic and lively note. Complete with some leaves of chervil and set aside . Move on to the salmon canapés. Dice the slices of smoked salmon into small regular cubes .
Take another 8 pieces of bread and spread a thin layer of fresh cheese on each . Place a spoonful of salmon tartare in the center , then enrich with a sprinkle of chopped pistachios and some chive strands for an aromatic and refined touch . Set aside and move on to the shrimp canapés. Spread the mayonnaise on 8 squares of bread .
Place a couple of shrimp in the center of each canapé and sprinkle with grated lime zest . These are ready too .
Assemble the last 8 canapés. First, spread the mayonnaise then, with the help of a teaspoon, form a small quenelle of lumpfish roe and place it in the center of each canapé . Complete with some fresh thyme leaves , which will add a delicate yet elegant aroma. Your Christmas canapés are ready .
The assembled canapés can be stored in the refrigerator, well covered with plastic wrap, for a few hours. However, to maintain the best texture, it is preferable to prepare the creams (anchovies, tuna) in advance and store them in airtight containers in the fridge for 1 day. Sandwich bread tends to dry out quickly: to avoid this, keep it sealed in its packaging until ready to use. Fresh decorations like shrimp, chervil, or citrus zest should be added only at the moment of serving to preserve color and flavor.
To achieve even more elegant and balanced canapés, we suggest filling the bread just before serving: this way it will remain soft and won't absorb the moisture from the creams. Decorate each canapé with the main ingredient so they can be easily recognized. Cover the canapés with dampened and wrung-out kitchen paper to prevent the bread from drying out.
