Tuscan pici —such a classic!—is one of those traditional Tuscan pasta dishes that fits perfectly into a relaxed Sunday lunch. Really, it’s great. The noodles are hand-rolled, a little thicker than spaghetti, and they have that tender, chewy bite you just don’t get from dried pasta. Folks in Tuscany have been making pici pasta with only flour, water and a bit of olive oil for ages. I mean, nothing fancy needed. The dough gets rolled out on a table until you have these long, slightly uneven ropes—just the way nonna did it. And listen, even if you can’t find aglione, which is this big, mild Tuscan garlic, you can make a really really tasty version with regular garlic and tomatoes. Pici goes well with all sorts of toppings. In Tuscany, people love it with simple aglione sauce or crunchy breadcrumbs sprinkled on top for a crispy contrast.
Regional twists keep things interesting with Tuscan pici . You might see pici cacio e pepe, where you get loads of creamy, peppery cheese coating each noodle, or ragù di funghi e noci with mushrooms and walnuts for a more earthy, rich flavor. Thing is, this hand-rolled pasta is so so simple to make at home. No pasta machine needed—like, for real. That’s why it’s a favorite for anyone wanting to try real authentic Tuscan cuisine . Pici is amazing because it picks up whatever sauce you throw at it, from the moist, garlicky tomato sauce to a golden olive oil drizzle. Plus, just a handful of good breadcrumbs or some sharp cheese can turn these noodles into something special.
This is the kind of food that brings everyone to the table. Really, it does. You can see why it’s been a staple in rustic Italian kitchens for generations. With its honest, homemade vibe, pici proves that sometimes the most satisfying dishes are the simplest. Whether it's a family gathering or a quiet dinner, Tuscan pici brings a piece of Tuscany right to your plate. Enjoy a taste of Italy's rich culinary tradition. So there you have it.

Pour some extra virgin olive oil into a non-stick pan , then add the garlic cloves and the chili . Let it cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes so the garlic cooks gently. When it's soft, mash it .

" Fonte Giusta " is a trattoria located in the historical heart of Siena, where the choice of raw materials and genuineness are what guests, both Italian and foreign, can still count on. Homemade bread, hand-rolled fresh pasta, sauces, and traditional Sienese recipes, as well as dishes that change with the seasons, make Fonte Giusta "a haven for the romantics of the table," as chef Giuseppe Chiarelli, also known as Chef Pino, likes to call it.
