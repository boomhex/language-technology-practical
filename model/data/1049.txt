instructions:
The Easter dove cake , or Colomba di Pasqua , is one of those treats that you just have to try. Really, it's a must-have in Italy, especially in Lombardy during spring. The thing is, this Italian Easter cake has a soft and moist dough, all thanks to real yeast—lievito di birra—just like the best breads out there. And, you know, its classic dove shape—symbolizing peace and hope—fits perfectly with Easter vibes.
There's a pretty cool history behind it, too. Stories from sixth-century Pavia with King Alboino and the modern version popping up in Milan about a hundred years ago. It's inspired by panettone—which is great, and this dove-shaped cake thrills with bits of tender candied orange peel and a crispy almond glaze that cracks so nicely when sliced. Sometimes, people go for chocolate to give it a fun twist.
Families all over Italy feel like Easter just wouldn’t be the same without this Easter dessert recipe . For real. From Lombardy to Sicily, Colomba di Pasqua sits proudly at the holiday table, often right next to other Italian sweet breads like panettone or pandoro. Seriously, it’s best fresh, whether from a bakery or homemade. But leftover slices? They're never wasted—turn them into French toast, trifles, or dunk them in coffee. So so tasty.
The sweet, golden loaf is really the heart of springtime desserts, offering something truly special and handmade. Folks in Lombardy are super proud of their original connection, but, you know, regional twists are everywhere, with bakeries adding their own touch. The almond glaze and sugared top are always favorites, though chocolate versions and extra fruits are fun too. However you slice it, this dove-shaped cake is a true symbol of the Italian Easter—making every gathering more joyful and a lot more tasty. Can't go wrong.

To prepare the Easter dove cake, start by placing flour, crumbled fresh yeast , milk , and water at room temperature in a bowl.
Mix well with a whisk . Once you have a smooth and very hydrated mixture, cover it with plastic wrap and let it rise at a temperature of 77-81°F for 2 hours or until it has doubled in volume . If the temperature in the house is lower, don't worry, just let it rise for a longer period. Alternatively, you can also place it in the oven turned off with the light on.
Once the dough has risen, transfer it to the bowl of a stand mixer with a hook attachment and add the sugar . Turn on the machine and gradually incorporate the flour . Continue to work to absorb it completely.
You can add the egg and continue working until you get a smooth dough . Only at this point can you add the softened butter, always a little at a time, until fully absorbed . It's crucial to add the butter slowly, one piece at a time, waiting for it to be well absorbed before adding more.
Continue working the dough until it is well combined . Do not stop before because the binding is essential. Then transfer it to a work surface and, with the help of a dough scraper, work it for a few moments, to give the dough a spherical shape . Do not add flour at this stage.
Transfer it into a glass bowl , covering it with plastic wrap . Let it rise again at a temperature of 77-81°F for 2 - 2.5 hours or until it has doubled in volume again . The same rule as before applies here: if the temperature in the house is lower, you can extend the rising times or place the dough in the oven turned off with only the light on. Or you can place a bowl with hot water at the bottom of the turned-off oven to create the right humidity and warmth in the rising chamber. The important thing is that the dough doubles.
Once it has risen, rinse the raisins and soak them in water for at least ten minutes . Meanwhile, pour the dough into the bowl of the stand mixer and add the sugar .
Attach the hook, turn on the machine at moderate speed, and when the sugar is completely absorbed, gradually add the flour and let it incorporate. Then slowly add the egg and, once it is well absorbed, add the salt .
Wait a few more moments until it is absorbed, then add the softened butter a little at a time, waiting for the piece to be absorbed before adding another . This process also requires patience. Once the butter is absorbed, proceed with the flavors: the seeds of a vanilla pod , diced candied orange peel .
Add the orange paste . At this point, drain the raisins well and incorporate them into the dough .
Work the dough until it is well combined, having incorporated the candied fruit and raisins; in total, it will take about 20 minutes . This phase is also important: do not stop the mixer until it is well combined. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface , flatten it gently with your hands, and give it reinforcement folds by bringing the outer edges of the dough towards the center .
Once the reinforcement folds are given, give the dough a spherical shape and transfer it into a large glass bowl, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rise at room temperature for about 1 hour. The rising should start; if it takes more time in this sense, wait longer before putting it in the fridge. Then place the bowl in the fridge to mature for 16 hours. It is normal that during this time, the dough does not grow or double in volume. After 16 hours, take it out of the fridge and bring it to room temperature for about 1 hour .
After this last phase, transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface: it will be quite hydrated but still cold enough and easy to work with. Divide the dough into 2 parts: one about 14 oz, which will form the body, and one about 17 oz, which will form the dove's wings , in any case, one slightly larger and one slightly smaller. Take the larger part, spread it out on the surface with your hands to form a rectangle and roll it from the shorter side to form a loaf .
Place the loaf inside the mold, folding the ends until they fill the shape of the wings . Then take the 17 oz portion of dough, spread it out on the surface, and roll it to form a second loaf .
Place it on top of the other loaf, in the longer part of the mold to form the body of the dove . Transfer to a tray , cover with plastic wrap, just laying it on top , and let it rise for about 3 hours at room temperature (away from drafts), or until it almost reaches the edge of the mold. Keep in mind that it may take longer in this phase, and it is an important phase: do not bake until it has reached the edge as indicated.
When the dove has risen, you can prepare the glaze: put the almonds and peeled hazelnuts in a mixer, add the brown sugar and blend everything. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add the cornmeal , cornstarch ,
the egg white , and work everything with a whisk for a few minutes , until you get a homogeneous glaze .
Then take the now risen dove , remove the plastic wrap, and cover it entirely with the glaze just prepared, spreading it gently to cover the entire surface, without applying too much pressure .
Garnish with the almonds and sugar granules . Transfer the mold to a baking sheet and bake the dove in a preheated static oven at 338°F for 55 minutes on the middle rack. To prevent it from coloring too much on the surface during baking, place a baking tray over the dove, thus reducing the heat coming from the coil.
Once out of the oven, insert long steel skewers along the entire length of the dove and place it upside down, suspended on supports, to let it cool. This will ensure that the dove does not collapse in the center as it cools. Once cold, remove the steel skewers and serve your Easter dove cake !
Store the dove cake for 2-3 days in an airtight food bag. Freezing is not recommended.
We recommend hydrating the raisins at least 10-12 hours before, changing the water from time to time if you prefer an even softer and moister effect in the dough.
The butter should be used at room temperature, which means soft but still plasticky. If temperatures are moderate, you can take it out of the fridge a couple of hours before use, adjusting according to the different phases.
If the dove in the mold does not rise within 3 hours, you will need to wait longer until it reaches the indicated level. Ensure it is not exposed to drafts that would prevent it from rising. If well worked and combined in the various stages, the dove, at this stage, will reach 1.5 inches from the edge without problems.
If you can't find orange paste, don't worry: just blend candied oranges with 10% water in a mixer to get the right consistency.
To prepare the glaze, it is best to use egg whites from the previous days so that they lose their \"strength\" or \"cord\", obtaining a glaze that will not crack excessively during baking.
