instructions:
To prepare the tomato and caciotta pappa, let's start with the sauce. In a pan with the oil, let the chopped onion and crumbled dried chili fry. Then add the tomato puree
and rinse the container with a little water: this way you can cook everything for about 40 minutes; adjust with salt . Keep an eye on the cooking and add more water if needed. Meanwhile, cut the colorful cherry tomatoes in half and place them, cut side up, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper .
Drizzle them on the surface with a little oil , sprinkle them with 1 level tablespoon of brown sugar , salt, and scent with oregano sprigs
Bake in a ventilated oven at 392°F (200°C) for about 20 minutes . Once ready , gather them in a bowl .
Deglaze the cooking base with a little water , pour over the cherry tomatoes and set aside . Cut the stale whole wheat bread into cubes
once the sauce is ready, plunge them inside , flavoring with plenty of hand-torn fresh basil . Stir for a few minutes over low heat, until the bread is completely soaked in the sauce .
Moisten again with a little water , cover and let it rest for a few minutes . Now add the cherry tomatoes
and distribute the pappa al pomodoro in 4 dishes . In a blender pitcher, blend some oil with basil , salt, and lemon zest .
Place the 4 caciottine in a non-stick pan greased with a little oil until they are melty . Transfer them to the dishes
and drizzle with the basil oil . Finish with pepper, basil, and lemon peels and here's your tomato and caciotta cheese pappa .
The tomato and cheese pappa can be stored for a couple of days in the refrigerator in an airtight container; it would be better to cook the cheese at the moment.
Too rushed to prepare the confit tomatoes or too hot to turn on the oven? The raw variant will be equally good: reduce the sugar to a pinch and season the cherry tomatoes in a bowl, letting them marinate for a few minutes beforehand.
