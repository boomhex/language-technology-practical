instructions:
To prepare pasta and potatoes alla tiella, first wash and peel the potatoes , then cut them into large pieces about an inch . Now take the caciocavallo cheese, remove the outer part, and cut it into cubes .
Pour the peeled tomatoes into a bowl and crush them with your hands. Try to break them up as much as possible to get a well-seasoned dish. Take the pasta, we used long candles, and break them into 3-4 parts with your hands. Now take a round baking dish with a 10-inch diameter. Place some of the tomatoes at the bottom .
Add some potatoes and create the first layer of pasta . Add more tomato .
Season with grated Pecorino cheese , generous cubes of Caciocavallo cheese , and dried oregano .
Add some breadcrumbs and more potatoes . Create a final layer of pasta .
Add the remaining sauce and Caciocavallo cheese . Salt .
Add the breadcrumbs by crumbling it with your hands , pour a generous drizzle of oil , and the water .
Cover with a sheet of parchment paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 464°F for 45 minutes. In the last 10 minutes, remove the parchment paper to brown the pasta well, then you can remove it from the oven and serve it .
Pasta and potatoes alla tiella can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
If you can't find long candles, you can use ziti or pennoni. Once out of the oven, let the pasta rest for about ten minutes. We recommend using Sila yellow potatoes, which are better suited for this type of cooking as they are more consistent.
