Schiacciate con involtini di San Daniele is the kind of Italian flatbread that really stands out. And listen, when you want something both crispy and a bit fancy, this is it. Straight from Friuli Venezia Giulia in northern Italy, this appetizer uses some of the best local stuff— Prosciutto di San Daniele (that tender, rosy ham with just the right amount of salt), creamy robiola cheese with fresh herbs, and a golden, crunchy schiacciata base. It's like—oh wow—the whole thing just comes together when you wrap those sweet, thin slices of ham around the herby cheese, tie them up with chives so they look like little presents, and set them on top of the flatbread. It's a dish that's all about simple but high-quality ingredients, and every bite gives you that mix of moist cheese, delicate ham, and a golden, crunchy bite from the bread. People in Italy call it an “sfizioso” treat, which, to be honest, pretty much means it’s impossible to eat just one—they’re that good.
Whether you’re having a casual gathering or putting together an elegant appetizer plate for a family dinner, these Schiacciate recipe bites are perfect for any occasion. You know, folks love how you can see the pretty green chive ties, the pink ham, and the soft white cheese all lined up on the traditional Italian bread . You get a mix of flavors: the ham is a little sweet and nutty, the robiola cheese is rich and creamy, and the herbs give everything a fresh kick. Compared to a regular Italian flatbread recipe or even a piadina with prosciutto, this one feels extra elegant but still super easy to eat with your hands. Schiacciate con involtini di San Daniele is a “piccolo piacere”—a small pleasure—because you can grab one after another and each one is just as good as the last. The recipe keeps things light and friendly, and you’ll see it show up at parties, as a snack before a meal, or just whenever someone wants a tasty bite that shows some of the best stuff from Friuli Venezia Giulia. This dish is really a celebration of regional flavors and simple elegance.
To prepare the flatbreads with San Daniele rolls, start with the robiola cream to stuff the slices of ham: in a bowl, place the robiola cheese, mix it, and adjust salt and pepper to taste. Then add the mix of herbs with mint, basil, and some chive sprigs to taste, previously chopped . Mix to blend the herbs and soften the robiola cheese and transfer the obtained cream into a piping bag. Then on a cutting board, position the slices of ham, divide them in half lengthwise . With the piping bag, place a dollop of robiola cream on each slice of ham .
Then roll it up on itself and close each roll obtained with a chive sprig . Now you can compose the flatbreads with San Daniele rolls and serve them as finger food for your appetizer!
The flatbreads with San Daniele rolls can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
