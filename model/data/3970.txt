The creamy texture shines right away—every spoonful is rich , cool, and loaded with DEEP chocolate flavor, while the vanilla comes through just right for a BALANCED taste families always love. This heavy cream dessert looks fluffy and smooth when scooped, and the color really pops against everything from a classic cone to a simple dish (kids and adults usually dig into it before it even hits the table). Lots of people say the sweet flavor tends to bring everyone around for second helpings—perfect at backyard cookouts, pool parties, family dinners, or laid-back weekends when everyone wants something INVITING and special. Honestly, it’s that familiar chocolate taste with nice vanilla notes that makes this really great for almost any crowd.
Home cooks and busy families appreciate how this vanilla and chocolate ice cream always delivers dessert success—it holds up well on hot afternoons yet fits in with winter birthday parties thanks to its versatility. For folks looking for a great ice cream that blends well in sundaes, between homemade cookies, or heaped on holiday brownies, this one just works.

To prepare the cocoa and vanilla cream, start by heating the milk with the cream in a small saucepan. Add the seeds of the vanilla bean, which you have cut lengthwise with a knife . Also incorporate the sugar and sifted cocoa and bring to a boil, stirring continuously to dissolve lumps and obtain a smooth mixture .
Let the mixture simmer for about 30 minutes. Allow the cream to cool, and when it is warm, pass it through a sieve to remove any lumps . Finally, add the alcohol and mix with a whisk to blend the cream well . Finally, transfer the cocoa and vanilla cream into glass bottles. Store the obtained cream in the refrigerator!
Store the cocoa and vanilla cream in the refrigerator in sterilized bottles closed with specific airtight caps. You can keep the chocolate liqueur in the refrigerator for a couple of months.
This indulgent liqueur also rightfully enters the category of aphrodisiac recipes, excellent for warming the atmosphere during a romantic dinner, while still maintaining a certain sweetness. Indeed, this liqueur contains two aphrodisiac ingredients: cocoa and vanilla.
