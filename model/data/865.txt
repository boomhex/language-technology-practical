instructions:
To make gratinated onions, peel the onions, removing only the first outer layer and any roots , then rinse them. Bring some water to a boil with a tablespoon of white wine vinegar and immerse the whole onions , boiling them for about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, wash and dry the cherry tomatoes, cut them into wedges , and set aside. Put the breadcrumbs in a bowl and add the grated Parmesan cheese , mixing everything together. Drain the onions and let them cool slightly. Cut them into wedges .
Cover the bottom of a baking dish with the breadcrumb and Parmesan mixture, drizzle with a little olive oil . Arrange the onion wedges , add the cherry tomatoes ,
capers, black olives, and season with salt and pepper. Generously sprinkle the top with the breadcrumb and Parmesan mixture, drizzle with olive oil . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 20 minutes and then switch to grill for another 5 minutes. Before serving, sprinkle the top with freshly chopped parsley .
Store at room temperature for 1 day. We do not recommend freezing.
If you love strong flavors, you can replace Parmesan with aged Pecorino cheese.
