Fried pizza strips —really popular in Campania —are perfect for those nights when you want something salty, like during a game or movie. These fried pizza dough strips are seriously good and always a hit. Just stretch some dough into strips, fill them with olives and sun-dried tomatoes, and fry until they're golden and crispy on the outside, with a soft and tender inside.
In Naples and other parts of Southern Italy, this snack is part of the beloved pizza fritta tradition. It shows just how delicious fried dough can be. And look, unlike panzerotti or mozzarella sticks, these deep-fried pizza sticks really pack a savory punch with their fillings. No need for dips—although dipping them in sauce or topping them with stracciatella cheese? Pretty much the best.
The best part? Just grab a handful and enjoy while chatting with friends or watching the game—no fancy setup. In Campania, they are sometimes called scugnizzi Napoletani. Often seen at parties or during an aperitivo, they're a crowd favorite. The moist dough and tangy sun-dried tomatoes mean these fried pizza strips disappear fast.
While fantastic solo, pairing them with cold cuts or extra sauce? For sure, it elevates the snack. Unlike the simpler gnocco fritto from the north, served with cheese or cured meats, these pizza strips have their own flavor punch—super tasty. People whip up big batches because, well, they vanish.
Whether you're after an easy fried pizza recipe for a game night or just some crispy, homemade pizza strips for a chill evening, these deep-fried appetizers turn any gathering into a party. So, here's the deal: make sure you have plenty because everyone will want seconds or even thirds. Enjoy the crunch and the flavors of this Southern Italian favorite. They'll bring a taste of Campania straight to your table—no question.
