Note plus 3 hours to purge the snails

instructions:
To prepare the stewed sea snails, the first thing to do is purge them. In a large bowl, pour 150 g of salt , add the small snails, and cover with a liter of water . Let them rest for about an hour .
At this point, drain them and repeat the same operation. Transfer them to the bowl with 150 g of salt , cover with a liter of water , and wait another hour. Repeat this operation again. If the water still appears dirty, you can repeat this operation to remove all impurities. When the small snails are well purged, chop the parsley and set it aside.
Do the same with the fennel . Then proceed to cook the small snails. Drain them and transfer them to a large pot. Add 40 g of salt and cover with cold water . Bring to a boil and let cook for 15 minutes.
In the meantime, start preparing the sauce for the small snails. In a pan, pour a drizzle of olive oil, add the basil and the clove of garlic , and let them sauté for a few minutes, just enough time for the aromas to release. Remove the garlic and basil with tongs and add the peeled tomatoes .
Crush them with a fork to coarsely break the peeled tomatoes and season with salt . After the 15 minutes of cooking, drain the small snails .
Transfer them to the sauce and cook for about 1 hour on low heat . After the cooking time, add the chopped parsley and fennel .
Add a pinch of pepper , a drizzle of raw olive oil , mix well and serve the stewed sea snails hot .
The stewed snails can be stored in the refrigerator for no more than one day.
When purchasing, the small snails should be very much alive so that during the boiling process they slightly come out of the shell. If the water during the purging phase appears very dirty, it's normal; just repeat the step in water and salt multiple times.
