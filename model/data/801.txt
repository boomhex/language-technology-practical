Semifreddo cake is one of those Italian desserts that just instantly elevates a summer get-together. Really good stuff. This semifreddo cake brings that rich, creamy vibe from mascarpone and whipped cream. But here’s the thing—it’s the soft, airy Italian meringue at its base that sets it apart. And you know what? The meringue does a cool trick: it keeps the cake from going rock solid in the freezer, so every slice stays velvety and easy to cut. Folks all over Italy love this—no question—especially since it’s a no-bake cake that doesn’t heat up the kitchen.

Across different Italian regions, you’ll find a bunch of semifreddo variations —some folks add nuts, others go for berries or citrus for a tangy twist. Even with these tweaks, the heart of the dessert is that moist, creamy filling with a touch of chocolate crunch. People get super creative with semifreddo flavors —espresso, pistachio, lemon—so there’s always something new to try. And listen, it’s a breeze to make—no tricky baking. This easy semifreddo recipe is all about simple steps and a few ingredients, but the result looks and tastes like a total showstopper.
Serving this at a party or family dinner? For sure, you’ll get "wow" reactions, especially when guests dig into the tender, layered slices.

To prepare the semi-frozen cake, start with the meringue. Pour the water and sugar into a saucepan, leaving a couple of tablespoons aside . Heat over medium heat and always monitor the temperature with a kitchen thermometer . The syrup should reach 250°F.
When it reaches 239°F, you can start whipping the egg whites. Pour them into a bowl, add the remaining sugar , and whip them with electric beaters until they are very stiff. When the syrup reaches 250°F, pour it slowly into the egg whites, still beating .
Continue whipping with the beaters until the mixture cools down. Now clean the beaters and whip the cream; it should be semi-whipped . Soften the mascarpone in a large bowl by working it with a spatula .
Then gradually add the meringue , mixing gently from bottom to top . Finally, add the semi-whipped cream in three batches, being careful not to deflate it .
You should get a smooth and well-whipped mixture . Cover with plastic wrap and transfer it to the fridge until needed. Now take care of the chocolate: coarsely chop 14 oz of chocolate and melt it in a double boiler or microwave .
Meanwhile, line an 8-inch springform pan with parchment paper on the base and a strip of acetate on the sides. Pour 4 tablespoons of chocolate inside and spread it over the entire base with the back of a spoon . Put it in the fridge. Now prepare the other discs; you will need a total of 5. Draw 5 circles of 7 inches on parchment paper with a pencil, using a pastry ring as a guide . Flip the parchment paper onto a baking tray and pour 2 tablespoons of chocolate for each circle. Spread the chocolate using the back of a spoon .
Once you have obtained 5 chocolate discs, transfer them to the fridge and wait for them to set well . When the chocolate has solidified, take the pan again and transfer a layer of cream inside .
Place a chocolate disc and continue this way, alternating your cream with the discs. Make sure to finish the dessert with a layer of chocolate . Cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for at least 6 hours.
Grate the remaining 3.5 oz of chocolate . If there's any leftover chocolate, drizzle it over the dessert with a fork; if it has solidified, you can melt it again. Add the grated chocolate , unmold the dessert, transfer it to a plate, and serve the semi-frozen cake .
You can store the semifreddo in the freezer for 4 days.
It should be consumed shortly after serving.
Want to give your semifreddo an extra boost? You can flavor the cream with the seeds of a vanilla bean and the pod, the night before in the fridge, in a bowl covered with plastic wrap. When you need to use it, just remove the pod, and your cream will have taken on a pleasant vanilla aroma!
