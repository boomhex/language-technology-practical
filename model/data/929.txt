Experience the rich flavors of Northern Italy with this baked pasta with mushrooms and sausage . Picture this: tender prataioli and portobello mushrooms mingling with juicy salsiccia, the classic Italian sausage loved in Lombardy. It's really, really good. Casera cheese, native to the region, melts beautifully into the creamy béchamel, making every bite moist and cheesy. And the thyme? Adds a herbal kick. Plus, the crispy breadcrumb topping—finished under the grill—gives a satisfying crunch.
This sausage and mushroom pasta bake is all about those special details. It's cozy, filling, and perfect for when the temperatures drop in Northern Italy. Unlike other Italian casseroles—like Paccheri ripieni con salsiccia e funghi—this baked ziti with mushrooms and sausage keeps it simple and comforting. Casera cheese stretches gooey over the top, while the béchamel wraps the pasta in creamy goodness. Really, it's so, so good.
The mushrooms add an earthy touch that complements the savory sausage perfectly. You'll find variations across Lombardy, but it's the combo of salsiccia, mushrooms, and cheese that makes it different from typical baked pasta dishes. For sure.
Whether you use penne or ziti, and call it baked penne with sausage and mushrooms or a creamy sausage and mushroom pasta , it's always about that crunchy crust and savory, cheesy filling. This dish brings everyone to the table, perfect for a big Sunday lunch or a comforting weeknight dinner. Fans of easy baked pasta recipes will love this Italian sausage pasta bake—especially when served bubbling hot, straight from the oven. And here's the thing, you can't go wrong.
