instructions:
To prepare the cod in a pan with fennel and bacon salad, first deal with the fennel. Wash the fennel and remove the base, cut away the part with the “beard” on top . Collect the fronds and set them aside in a small bowl to use as a garnish for the salad . At this point, start slicing the fennel thinly with the help of a mandoline .
Place the fennel in a bowl with plenty of ice water , this step will make the fennel crisp and slightly curly. Now, brown the bacon in a non-stick pan . Cook it until it is well browned and slightly crispy .
Set it aside , it will be used to finish your dish. Now, take care of cooking the cod fillet, in a well-heated non-stick pan, pour a drizzle of oil and start browning your cod . Cook it on one side until it takes on a nice golden color, then turn it over and finish cooking; it will take about 6 minutes per side over medium-high heat.
Once the cod is ready , drain the fennel and plate the cod with the salad on one side, finish with the sweet bacon and the fennel fronds set aside, season with pepper to taste .
Consumption is recommended immediately, but you can prepare the fennel salad in advance.
We did not add salt to the preparation because the bacon will provide the right saltiness to the dish. However, you can season the fennel salad to your liking, even with orange juice if you appreciate citrus aromas.
