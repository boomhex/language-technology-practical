Torcelli con crema di lenticchie e guanciale is a classic from Emilia-Romagna that truly shows what makes Italian pasta dishes special. Torcelli, a rustic, hand-rolled pasta, is chunkier than your usual spaghetti or penne. Really good stuff. It works perfectly for scooping up that smooth, creamy lentil cream . But the real star? The crispy guanciale. When you bite into a piece of torcelli, you get this awesome contrast: the pasta is tender and chewy, the lentil sauce is super moist and rich, and then you hit that crunchy, salty guanciale. People in Emilia-Romagna love these dishes when winter rolls around—something hearty that feels like a warm hug. Plus, folks often pass around a big platter of this at gatherings, with everyone grabbing pieces and dipping them in the golden lentil sauce.
And here's the thing: what makes this Torcelli recipe different is how it turns simple, humble ingredients into something you really really want to enjoy with friends. The guanciale pasta isn’t just about the flavor, though that salty pork brings so much to the table—it’s also about the textures. You get a bit of everything: crispy pork, tender pasta, and creamy lentils all in one bite. For sure. In Emilia-Romagna , it’s common to see small variations, like adding more garlic or using a splash of wine in the lentil sauce for extra tangy notes, depending on the village or even the family.
Here's the deal: this is the sort of food that appears when people want to keep things casual but still make it feel special. Everything about it says comfort and tradition, but there’s something fun—eating pasta with your hands, dipping and sharing, especially when it’s warm and everyone’s laughing. If you’re after a real taste of northern Italian gatherings, this is one of those traditional Italian recipes that gets the job done with no fuss. Just good food, good company, and a lot of flavor. Pretty simple. It's a dish that brings people together, capturing the heart of Italian hospitality and joy.
To prepare the torcelli with lentil cream and guanciale, start by sautéing the finely chopped onion in the oil . When the onion is softened, add the raw lentils and let them absorb the seasoning for a moment. Now, cover the lentils with the broth and cook on low heat for 40-45 minutes,
seasoning with salt and pepper at the end of cooking . On a cutting board, cut the guanciale into cubes and brown them in a non-stick pan (do not add oil).
When they are red and crispy, remove them from the heat and chop them further . Blend the lentils until you obtain a thick and compact cream . Put the mixture in a pot and add the butter . When it is completely melted, add the guanciale cubes (keep a handful for the final decoration) and let cool. Place your lentil and guanciale cream in individual serving containers, arrange the remaining guanciale on the surface, and serve with the torcelli.
