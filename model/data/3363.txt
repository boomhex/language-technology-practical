instructions:
To prepare the sweet potato soup, clean the spring onions and slice them thinly, then let them soften over very low heat with the oil and butter for at least 15 minutes in a saucepan . In the meantime, peel the potatoes and cut them into not too large cubes .
When the spring onions have softened but not taken on color, add the sweet potato pieces to a saucepan and then the vegetable broth; season with salt, cover with a lid, and let cook until they become tender (about 20 minutes). Blend the mixture with an immersion blender until you obtain a smooth cream, as fine as velvet. Add fresh cream , sweet paprika, and adjust the salt. If the soup is too thick, add more vegetable broth.
Heat a non-stick pan and when it is well hot, place the slices of bacon on it and brown them on both sides, then drain them from excess fat and fold them over themselves to form a V, then place them on a plate . Pour the soup into 4 deep dishes (not too large), preferably 4 small bowls, sprinkle with a few pinches of paprika , place the slice of bacon in the center, finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and then serve with some croutons or slices of toasted bread.
You can store the sweet potato soup in the refrigerator, closed in an airtight container, for up to a couple of days.
Even the best gets boring, so to avoid seeing this delicacy left over, serve it in small bowls: since there is also cream, more than ten spoonfuls would be an exaggeration!
