Olive Ascolane (Ascolana-style Olives) are a cherished appetizer originating from Italy, particularly the Ascoli Piceno area in the Marche region. This culinary tradition is deeply rooted in local culture, where entire families gather to craft these delights in large batches. They meticulously prepare, bread, and freeze the olives, ensuring a supply that's ready to be fried and savored at a moment's notice. Ascolana olives are also a popular choice for street food. Among the renowned spots for these treats is "Siamo Fritti" in Ascoli. We had the honor of featuring Gabriella Calvaresi, a revered chef from this establishment, renowned for her authentic preparation of Ascolana olives. The process is captivating: the olives are delicately spiraled open, then filled with a rich, hand-ground meat mixture — Gabriella uses her family's traditional grinder for an authentic touch. Besides the classic recipe, we also present a vegetarian version of Ascolana olives. This alternative is just as enticing, starring the same brined olives but without the meat.
To start making Olive Ascolane, first soak the olives for 12 hours in water flavored with fresh fennel . Then, prepare the meat for the filling: cut the beef and pork into small pieces.
Cut the chicken breast into pieces as well . In a pot, pour in some oil , then add the coarsely chopped carrot and celery along with half an onion, into which you've inserted the cloves . Let the vegetables sauté for a few minutes.
Then add the beef and pork , season with pepper , cover with a lid, and cook for about 20 minutes .
Now add the chicken breast , pour in the wine , and add salt .
Now cook for an hour with the lid on . After that time, turn off the heat and let it cool . Remove the cloves from the onion and then pass everything through a meat grinder.
Transfer the ground meat to a bowl, add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano DPO cheese and the egg , season with grated nutmeg , and mix with your hands until you achieve a uniform mixture .
Now, spiral-cut the olives to remove the pit . Move on to the stuffing process: open up the olives .
Stuff the olives with the filling and close them to recreate their original shape .
Now, let's move on to the breading process: beat the eggs with salt , then coat the stuffed olives first in flour , and then dip them into the eggs .
Drain to remove any excess egg , and then roll the olives in breadcrumbs . Place them on a tray .
To finish, let's move on to frying: heat the vegetable oil, and when it reaches a temperature of 355°F / 180°C, carefully place the olives into it. Cook them for about 2 minutes, just until they turn golden brown. Then, remove them from the oil and place them on a tray lined with paper towels . Serve the olive Ascolane while they are still slightly warm !
We recommend consuming olive Ascolane olives immediately to preserve their crispiness.
It is also possible to bread the stuffed olives and freeze them in their raw state, then fry them directly from frozen when needed.
The meat grinder allows you to achieve the right consistency for the filling mixture. We advise against using a blender or mixer because it could make the meat overly soft.
In this recipe, the traditional method for pitting the olives was used, but if you prefer, you can use pitted olives.
If you prefer a crunchier texture, you can opt for a double breading technique.
