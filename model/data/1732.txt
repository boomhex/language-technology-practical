instructions:
To make the cookies with few ingredients, pour the brown sugar into a bowl , add the eggs , and beat the mixture with electric beaters
until it turns light and frothy . At this point, also incorporate the peanut butter using the electric beaters .
Once the dough is homogeneous, add the chocolate chips and mix to distribute them . Now transfer the dough into a pastry bag with a plain nozzle .
Line the baking tray with parchment paper, and squeeze the dough out of the pastry bag to create cookies about 1 inch in diameter, trying to achieve more or less the same shape to ensure even baking (10-11). Place the tray in the refrigerator for 5 minutes so the cookies maintain their shape during baking. Bake the cookies in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 10-12 minutes, placing the tray on the middle shelf of the oven. Once baked, remove the cookies with few ingredients from the oven and let them cool before enjoying them!
The cookies with few ingredients can be stored for 5 days in a tin box or under a glass dome. They can be frozen after baking.
Try also the version with nuts: simply replace the chocolate chips with coarsely chopped walnuts, hazelnuts, or almonds!
