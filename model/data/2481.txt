To prepare the Savory pie with Tropea onion and Silano, start by preparing the Easy Shortcrust Pastry . Take a food processor and add the flour and cold butter cut into coarse pieces from the fridge, adjust with salt and mix the ingredients until you get a sandy and floury dough. Pour the mixture onto a work surface shaping it like a fountain, adding little by little the ice-cold water . When the ingredients are uniformly mixed, wrap the dough shaped into a ball in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 40 minutes.
While the shortcrust pastry is resting in the fridge, proceed to prepare the filling, starting with the Tropea onion. Peel off the outermost layer, then slice it not too thinly. Take a non-stick pan, drizzle a bit of extra virgin olive oil and cook your sliced Tropea onion over moderate heat. Deglaze with red wine and when almost cooked, add a pinch of sugar to caramelize it . Stir using a spoon to ensure the onion is evenly cooked. When the Tropea onion is cooked, transfer it to a bowl and let it cool slightly.
Now move on to the preparation of the Béchamel sauce . Place a drizzle of oil in a pan and sauté the finely chopped onion . Add the flour and mix it with the onion, blending well to avoid lumps .
Meanwhile, heat the milk in a saucepan. When you have well blended, add the heated milk , flavored with nutmeg . Adjust with salt ,
and pepper . Continue to cook and stir until you get a creamy mixture . Then turn off the heat and set aside, covering with a lid or with plastic wrap in contact.
Meanwhile, cut 5 oz of Silano cheese first into horizontal strips and then into cubes , and 7 oz of Silano cheese into thin slices. At this point, you have all the preparations necessary to assemble your savory pie with Tropea onion and Silano. Using a rolling pin, roll out the shortcrust pastry dough . Now take a round baking dish with a diameter of 10.5 inches and line it with parchment paper. Now roll the pastry disk onto the rolling pin and unroll it over the mold , making it adhere well.
Use a fork to prick the rolled-out shortcrust pastry . Then add the previously prepared béchamel and spread it evenly over the pastry . Add on top of the béchamel the diced Silano cheese
Now also add the sliced Silano cheese . Lay over these ingredients spread on the shortcrust pastry the previously sautéed onion . Now bake your savory pie with Tropea onion and Silano in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 40 minutes (or in a convection oven at 320°F for 30 minutes). Serve and enjoy !
Don't have Tropea onion and Silano caciocavallo at home? Then try making this savory pie with blonde onion instead of red one or with Grana instead of Silano provola! This pie will also be great to enjoy with a puff pastry base: you'll lick your chops!
The pie can be stored in the fridge if wrapped in plastic wrap or in an airtight container for up to 2 days.
It can be frozen before baking.
