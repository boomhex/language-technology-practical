It’s not uncommon to serve them with fresh fruit, honey drizzle, or maple syrup for a bit of sweetness. They go great with a dusting of cinnamon too. Really.
The pancakes come out golden on the outside and stay soft inside—which is kind of the best of both worlds. It's a pretty good easy pancake recipe for those mornings when you don’t want to fuss. You know? You can even mix things up—some folks add berries or a scoop of protein powder for more flavor.
