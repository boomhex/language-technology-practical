Skillet apples, like pears, are a genuine dessert with rustic flavors. A pinch of cinnamon and a handful of raisins will enhance the natural sweetness of the apples, making them a great and healthy snack for children, a little treat to enjoy fruit in a more indulgent way. Here we offer a simple pan-cooking method, but you can also try the traditional oven version , those cooked in the microwave , or even the air fryer cooked apples recipe. Skillet apples are great to enjoy on their own, but they are also an ideal accompaniment for desserts like french toast or Pain perdu with caramelized apples . Moreover, they are never missing in traditional recipes like apple charlotte or crumble . If you want to make more original recipes, try our apple puff pastry rings !

To prepare the skillet apples, first soak the raisins in warm water for 10 minutes . Wash the apples thoroughly under running water. Cut the apples in half and remove the core , then slice them thinly .
Melt a pat of butter in a small pan over low heat , lay the apple slices overlapping them . Squeeze the juice of half a lemon .
Add the brown sugar , the raisins , and a pinch of cinnamon .
Cover with water and cook for 10 minutes with the lid on . After this time, finish cooking without the lid for another 10 minutes to let the excess water evaporate. Let cool slightly and then serve the skillet apples .
We recommend consuming the skillet apples immediately.
You can use honey as an alternative to sugar. If you want to add an aromatic note, you can soak the raisins in a liqueur like Rum or Grand Marnier.
