To prepare the pumpkin spice latte, start with the pumpkin cream: clean the pumpkin by removing the skin, seeds, and fibers, then cut 5.6 oz (160 gr) of pulp into cubes .
Place the pumpkin cubes in a large baking dish , cover with plastic wrap , pierce the surface, and cook in the microwave on high power for 6 minutes . If you don't have a microwave, you can steam the pumpkin: it will take about 10 to 12 minutes.
Once cooked, transfer the pumpkin to an immersion blender jar and blend to obtain a smooth and homogeneous puree . Set aside.
Now proceed with the syrup: in a small saucepan, pour the water , sugar , and spices .
Add the pumpkin cream and bring to a boil, then simmer on low heat for about 2 or 3 minutes, continuing to stir. Set the syrup aside and let it cool . Move on to the whipped cream: pour the cold cream into a bowl and add the powdered sugar.
Beat with an electric mixer until you achieve a firm and stiff consistency . Now focus on the frothed milk: pour the milk into a large glass .
Then take a frother to create the foam . Finally, prepare the coffee. You are ready to assemble the cups: pour the pumpkin syrup at the bottom .
Add a shot of coffee , then pour the frothed milk and stir .
Finish by garnishing with plenty of whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon . Your pumpkin spice latte is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the pumpkin spice latte immediately.
The pumpkin syrup can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container.
As an alternative to frothed milk, you can simply add milk or mix it with a little whipped cream to make it less liquid
You can replace cow's milk and cream with other types of plant-based beverages to obtain a vegan or lactose-free version.
Instead of butternut squash, you can use any other variety of pumpkin available.
