instructions:
Start preparing the rice soup with leeks and potatoes by washing the potatoes, peeling them, and slicing them first into fairly thin slices then dividing them into four parts. Clean the leeks and cut them finely and melt some butter in a pot.
Chop the shallots and parsley, add them to the pot with the butter, and let them fry. Then add the leeks and the potatoes , let them season for a few minutes, add salt and pepper.
Then add all the vegetable broth and cook the soup for about 30 minutes, until the leeks are almost completely melted and the potatoes are tender. Add the rice and cook everything for another 20 minutes, stirring occasionally . Adjust the salt and serve the rice soup with leeks and potatoes piping hot, sprinkled with grated Parmesan and garnished with parsley leaves.
