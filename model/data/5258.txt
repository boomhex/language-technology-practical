Enhance your everyday menu with a quick and easy side dish like radicchio in the pan, perfect for accompanying meat and fish mains.

After trying our radicchio in the pan recipe, don't miss these side dishes with radicchio:

To make the radicchio in the pan, first remove the outer leaves , then halve the head and remove the central core . Finally, cut the leaves into strips .
Rinse the radicchio under running water . If you want to reduce the bitter note, you can soak it for 30 minutes with a pinch of salt, otherwise skip this step. In a non-stick pan, sauté the unpeeled garlic cloves with the oil , then add the well-drained radicchio .
Add salt and pepper , then stir and cook over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes. When the radicchio has softened and changed color, turn off the heat and remove the garlic cloves . Garnish the radicchio in the pan with walnut kernels just before serving !
Radicchio in the pan can be stored for 2 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container.
You can omit the nuts or garnish the radicchio in the pan with pine nuts or hazelnuts, for example!
