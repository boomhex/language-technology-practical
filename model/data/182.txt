To prepare the lemon pie, start by making the shortcrust pastry. You can knead it by hand or with the help of a stand mixer. In the mixer bowl, place the flour, add the butter , sugar , and grated lemon zest .
Add an egg , a pinch of salt , and knead with the paddle until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough ball. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, focus on preparing the lemon curd. Squeeze the lemons; you will get about 4 oz of juice. Pour it into a saucepan and bring to a boil. In a bowl, crack the eggs and egg yolk , add the sugar .
Add the grated lemon peel and mix thoroughly to combine all the ingredients . Then add the cornstarch .
Mix again and add the lemon juice in two batches, stirring continuously. Transfer the mixture to the saucepan .
Continue stirring until the mixture comes to a boil. Turn off the heat and add the butter , stir once more until it has completely melted , then let it cool down by transferring it to a bowl.
Take the shortcrust pastry and roll it out with a rolling pin . To avoid overheating it and to avoid using flour, you can do this using parchment paper. Line a 9.5 inch tart pan with the pastry and remove the excess . Prick the bottom with a fork . Put the pan in the fridge and let it rest for another 30 minutes.
Take the pan, line the interior with parchment paper and pour dried beans inside . Bake in a static oven at 340°F for 15 minutes. Remove the beans and parchment paper and bake the base again in a static oven at 320°F for 15 minutes, let it cool completely .
Put the lemon curd on the base , level it with the back of a spoon, and then let it rest in the fridge for 12 hours. After this time, you can focus on preparing the Italian meringue. In a small saucepan, pour the water and 5.3 oz of sugar and bring to a temperature of 250°F. In the stand mixer bowl, pour the egg whites, add 1.8 oz of sugar , and beat until stiff.
Without stopping the machine, pour the sugar syrup in a thin stream and beat until the Italian meringue is no longer hot and remains stable . Transfer it to a piping bag .
Take the base with the lemon curd out of the fridge and garnish with the Italian meringue , flambé with a blowtorch , and decorate with a few mint leaves and grated lemon zest. The lemon pie is ready to be enjoyed .
The lemon pie can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days. It can be frozen in suitable bags, in which case it can be stored for 2-3 months.
You can prepare in advance both the shortcrust pastry base and the lemon curd and store them in the refrigerator. This way, you can focus better on the assembly and decoration of the cake. For blind baking the shortcrust pastry, if you don't have beans, you can use dried chickpeas.
