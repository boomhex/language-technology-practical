instructions:
To prepare the basmati rice with grilled prawns and peppers, first clean the prawns. Remove the head, shell, and extract the intestine, which is the black filament on the back . In a baking dish, place the prawns, lime zest , salt, pepper, marjoram leaves, and also the oil . Mix and let marinate in the fridge just enough time to prepare the rest.
Cut the leek into very thin rings . Also cut the peppers into cubes about 1 inch . Also cut the yellow cherry tomatoes in half .
In a large pan, pour a drizzle of oil, add the leek, and stew for about 5 minutes over medium-high heat. Then add the peppers and continue cooking all together for about 15 minutes . Add the cherry tomatoes and continue cooking for another 10-15 minutes.
Season with salt, pepper, and marjoram leaves . Toast the cashews in a pan . Now boil the basmati rice in salted water for the time indicated on the package .
Drain and dress with a drizzle of oil . Set aside. Grill the prawns on a grill for 3 minutes on each side .
They should be golden . Serve the rice with the vegetables, grilled prawns, toasted cashews , some marjoram leaves, and slices of lime .
Basmati rice with grilled prawns and peppers can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days. We don't recommend freezing it.
You can replace the lime with lemon zest. This dish will be excellent both cold and warm.
