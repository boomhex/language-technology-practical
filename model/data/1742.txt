instructions:
Dive into a truly unique twist on Italian cuisine with this incredibly flavorful prosciutto broth . It’s paired with tender, soft flakes of cod—seriously good—inspired by Chef Andrea Berton's clever techniques. Hailing from Northern Italy, this dish combines the rich, salty heart of prosciutto crudo with the delicate texture of cod. Really, it creates a flavor profile that's hard to beat. The prosciutto broth not only boosts the taste of the cod, but adds a depth you don’t often find. The moist, silky texture of thinly shaved cod fillet just soaks up all the goodness. And look, the crispy bread topping ? It adds a crunch that makes every bite a real treat.
In true Italian fashion, nothing goes to waste—leftover prosciutto and shallots are dried and ground into a fine powder, sprinkled over the fish, ensuring everything contributes something special. It’s smart. And here’s the thing, a colorful radish garnish provides a pop of color and a sharp, fresh taste. Those thin, crispy radish slices? They’re not just for show. They bring a bit of tangy zip that perfectly cuts through the richness of the broth and savory cod.
In Northern Italy, they really really appreciate dishes with strong flavors and clever textures. This flaked cod recipe totally nails that vibe. Unlike the usual baked cod or simple Italian broths, this dish goes beyond with its golden bits of crispy bread topping and the refreshing radish salad. It’s pretty cool to see how a few basic ingredients—cod, prosciutto, bread, and radish—can transform into something so refined and surprising with just a few clever kitchen tricks. This creative take on Italian comfort food is perfect for anyone eager to explore new culinary horizons. It offers a blend of tastes and textures that will keep you coming back for more. For sure.
Start by making the ham broth. Take the slightly thick slices of ham and place them one on top of the other. Then, using a sharp knife, cut them into julienne strips . Continue like this until you finish the ham. You should obtain a regular cut that will allow you to achieve an even browning, which will give more flavor to the broth. Set the ham aside and take care of the shallots. First, peel them (2-3),
then cut them in half and then into thin regular slices lengthwise . At this point, heat a saucepan, and add a drizzle of oil to give a bit of richness .
When the oil is very hot, add the ham and let it brown, stirring often , until it tastes very crispy. This phase is very important because it extracts the flavor of the ham and the saltiness, so you won’t need to add salt to the broth. When the ham is well-roasted, add the shallots
and, always stirring, let them braise together. When you achieve an even browning , you can add cold water . Increase the heat and initially opt for a very high flame boil that helps release impurities. Then lower the heat and continue cooking for another 45 minutes. In this case, slow boiling serves to obtain a clearer and more transparent broth.
After the necessary time , place a thin-mesh food paper over a colander. Alternatively, you can use food-grade gauze. Using a ladle, extract only the liquid part, reserving the ham and shallot for later use, and pour it into the colander to filter it. As soon as you have obtained all the broth , store it in the refrigerator for the next 24 hours, and in the meantime, prepare the ham powder.
After 24 hours, take out the broth. You will notice that the dark liquid part has remained at the bottom, while the fat has surfaced . Using a ladle, remove the fat part until you obtain a clear, completely defatted broth .
While the broth completely cools in the refrigerator, prepare the ham powder. Take what you set aside with the shallot and transfer it to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Then, using a ladle and a scraper, spread it out (1-2) so that it covers the entire tray without overlapping the pieces . This phase is very important because the more evenly the ham is distributed, the more it will dry uniformly. Bake in a preheated static oven at 158°F on the central shelf. After 24 hours, remove the tray from the oven . You will immediately notice that the ham and shallot are well-dried.
Wait a few moments, then transfer them to the container of a mixer with blades and blend until you get a very fine powder . Transfer to a small bowl and set aside .
Now, take care of the radish cooking. First, pour the vinegar , water , and salt into a rather small pot. Bring to a boil.
Meanwhile, rinse the radish and cut off the green part of the leaves . As soon as the liquid reaches a boil, place the radish in the cooking water so that it is completely covered, and let it cook for 20 minutes. After this time , let it cool in the cooking water for another 20 minutes.
Then transfer it to a cutting board and cut it first in half and then again in half to obtain 4 wedges .
Pick only the parsley leaves until you get 5.3 oz (1-2). Meanwhile, place a pot full of lightly salted water on the heat, and as soon as it starts boiling, immerse the parsley .
Wait 30 seconds, then drain it . Once cooked, it will weigh about 2.6 oz. Then let it cool slightly, squeeze it , and place it in a tall-sided container . Blend it with an immersion mixer
until you get a smooth cream . Meanwhile, melt the butter. Add the seed oil , water ,
cornstarch , and butter . Blend again with the immersion mixer slowly,
for about 5-6 minutes until you get a smooth and velvety cream . At this point, heat a pan about 11 inches on the stove and pour a ladle of the mixture (14-15).
Let it cook, as if it were a crêpe, for about 15 minutes over medium heat, without ever turning it. It should simmer until the water has completely evaporated and the mixture is crispy . Lift the disc from the pan and let it drain ,
then transfer it to a cutting board and using an 8 cm pastry cutter, cut out smaller wafers (20-21). You will get about 12.
When everything is ready, take care of the cod. Divide the cod fillets into 4 pieces . Then take a steamer, place hot water underneath, and a pinch of salt. Place the basket on top and position the 4 cod fillets . Cover with the lid
and let the cod cook for 6-7 minutes until it is white and tender . At this point, place it on the cutting board and using a knife and a toothpick, flake it (5-6).
As soon as all the preparations are ready, all you have to do is assemble the dish. Slightly heat the broth . Meanwhile, place 1/4 of the cod in a fan-like manner in the center of each plate (2-3).
Then powder with the ham powder, making a line in the center (4-5). Also, place 1/4 of the radish in the center
and the wafer above the radish . Finish by pouring the ham broth and serve immediately .
Once the dish is composed, eat it immediately.
The broth alone can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days; alternatively, it can be frozen.
The ham powder can be stored for 1 week in an airtight container.
The radishes can be stored in their cooking water for 1 day in the refrigerator.
The wafers can be stored on a paper towel and well-covered for up to 2-3 days.

Use a ham aged at least 15 months. Parma or San Daniele will do just fine. If it is a bit fatty, don't worry, the broth will be defatted, and the result will be the same. In the phase of toasting the ham, the saucepan must always be well-heated, evenly. So keep the flame rather lively. If the temperature drops too much, the ham would boil and could affect the broth's flavor. Pouring cold water into the broth causes a thermal shock that allows you to extract the ham's flavor and have a more intense taste. Drying the ham with the shallot is a very delicate step. Instead of the oven, you can use a dehydrator, but unfortunately, you can't reduce the cooking times because the result will not be the same. Increasing the temperature means shorter times, but the ham will color too much, releasing a different taste. The radish cooking water can be reused to cook other vegetables or to store the radish in the refrigerator for a few days. In addition to the water in the steamer, you can add half a squeezed lime, 2 thyme sprigs, 2 garlic cloves, and 7 oz of white wine for a richer aroma.
