Sugoli d’uva is this classic dessert from Northern Italy —think about vineyards stretching for miles, and the air smelling all grape-y in September. I mean, really, what’s not to love? Born out of a tradition of using every single bit of the harvest, this grape pudding is made from grapes that are, you know, just a bit past their prime for wine. Cook them nice and slow, and you get this deep, tender sweetness. Really, really good stuff. The magic kicks in when you strain the juice, thickening it up with flour and sugar to create this dense, smooth cream that sets just perfectly—not too runny, not too stiff.
This dessert brings back all the memories of family gatherings, right around those big wooden tables, where bowls of Italian grape dessert were the highlight of fall. Sugoli d’uva isn't flashy, but it's got that old-school comfort. Pretty simple, honestly. As it simmers, the kitchen fills with a sweet grape aroma. Just awesome. Sugoli d’uva is all about grape harvest season, showing up from Lombardy to Emilia-Romagna when grapes are everywhere.
Now, some towns might tweak these traditional Italian recipes with different grapes, but the heart of it stays the same. You end up with a bowl of creamy, slightly tangy pudding—this is grape must pudding that’s rustic and a bit special. Eating it slowly is the way to go—this is slow food at its best. And listen, sugoli fits right in with those Italian harvest desserts that make autumn just feel right.
Picture long, lazy afternoons and the joy of home-cooked treats. No question why sugoli is a favorite in northern Italian homes. Few simple ingredients—plus a little patience—and you've got a golden taste of the season that lingers long after the grapes are gone. It’s a dessert that really captures rural Italian traditions, making it an essential part of the harvest celebration. For sure.
To prepare grape sugoli, start by destemming the grapes , then rinse them well under running water . Place the grapes in a large pot, cover it with a lid , and cook them over low heat for 2-3 minutes.
Add the water and let the grapes wilt, covered and stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, until they become soft and start releasing juice . Pass the cooked grapes through a food mill and set the juice aside .
At this point, mix the sugar and flour in a bowl and add the seeds from the vanilla pod (or vanilla extract) . Gradually add the previously obtained grape juice to the dry ingredients ,
vigorously mixing with a whisk to prevent lumps in the sugoli mixture . Strain the rather liquid mixture obtained to eliminate any lumps and transfer it to a saucepan . Cook over low heat and, stirring occasionally , bring to a boil.
Once the mixture has thickened and reached a nice purple color , turn off the heat and divide the mixture into 6 ceramic molds (or silicone or aluminum) with a capacity of about 3.5 oz each . Cover the sugoli with plastic wrap and let them set in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Your grape sugoli are ready to be enjoyed!
Store the grape sugoli in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, for up to 2 days.
Instead of table grapes, you can use Concord grapes: you'll get even tastier sugoli!
