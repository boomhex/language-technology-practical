instructions:
Clean the raisins and soak them in a container with hot water , and once softened, pat them dry with a cloth . Beat the eggs with 125 g of sugar using a mixer or a stand mixer; in a bowl, cream the butter with the remaining sugar .
Add the beaten eggs to the butter and sugar mixture, continuing to mix until you get a smooth and homogeneous cream . Then add the rum , the grated zest of one lemon .
Then add the sifted baking powder and flour . Add the seeds of the vanilla bean, the candied fruit, and 2/3 of the raisins to the batter and mix until the ingredients are completely combined ; butter and flour a plum cake mold and pour the mixture into it , making sure that the batter does not exceed 2/3 of the mold. Level it with a spatula, add the remaining raisins on the surface, and bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (before taking out the plum cake, poke it with a skewer, which should come out dry).
In the meantime, prepare the glaze for the plum cake by mixing the boiling water with the powdered sugar until the ingredients reach the right consistency , then once the plum cake is unmolded, place it on the surface of the cake .
If you don't like candied fruit or raisins, you can make the English plum cake without one of these ingredients without changing the recipe. Instead of the glaze, you can cover the surface of your English plum cake with powdered sugar.
