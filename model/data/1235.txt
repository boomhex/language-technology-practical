instructions:
To prepare tagliolini with shrimp and lemongrass, first clean the shrimp: remove the head and shell by gently pulling them off with your hands . Use a toothpick to remove the black vein on the back . Prepare about 1 quart of stock with the shrimp scraps, one carrot, one onion, and 2 stalks of lemongrass, and keep it warm (it will need to be boiling to cook the tagliolini). Cut the cherry tomatoes in half, both the yellow and the red ones .
In a pan, pour the oil, the peeled garlic clove, the chopped chili pepper , and the lemongrass stalks cut in half . Sauté for a few minutes and when they have released their aroma, remove them using kitchen tongs .
Add the cherry tomatoes to the pan and season with salt and a teaspoon of brown sugar . Keep the heat high and when they wilt, add the cleaned shrimp ,
they should cook for a maximum of one minute . Add the oregano leaves , grate a piece of ginger , toss everything together, and turn off the heat.
Cook the tagliolini in the boiling stock and after 4 minutes, drain them directly into the pan. Toss them for a minute and plate up. Decorate with fresh oregano and serve the tagliolini with shrimp and lemongrass while still hot .
It is recommended to consume the tagliolini immediately.
Freezing is not recommended.
For a crunchy note, add toasted almonds!
