To prepare the eggplant balls with a smoked cheese heart, start by cleaning and cutting the eggplants: remove the stalk and base, peel them with a vegetable peeler and, after cutting them in half, dice them . To learn how to best perform this operation, consult the Cooking School: how to clean and cut eggplant.
Fill a large pot with water, and when the water reaches boiling, add the diced eggplant . Let them blanch for 4-5 minutes, then drain them well with a colander placed over a bowl . Press the cooked cubes with the back of a skimmer or spoon to remove all excess water.
Now transfer the squeezed eggplant into a food processor and blend for a few seconds until they become a purée . Pour the mixture into a bowl and add the cracked eggs .
Add the grated pecorino cheese and place the stale bread on a cutting board, then cut it into chunks , which you will transfer to a food processor. Blend for a few seconds until finely crumbled .
At this point, add the crumbled stale bread to the eggplant and egg mixture , also add parsley , salt, and pepper to taste, and mix everything with a fork to combine .
Once you have a homogeneous and compact mixture, work it with your hands, forming balls . Create a small well in the center of the balls by pressing lightly with a fingertip . Now place the smoked cheese on a cutting board and cut it into rather small cubes .
Position the smoked cheese cubes inside the well you created in each ball , then manipulate the edges of the balls to compact them, enclosing the smoked cheese heart inside and preventing it from leaking out during cooking . Pour the breadcrumbs into a bowl and coat each ball, turning them several times to ensure even breading .
Heat peanut oil well in a pot with high sides and fry the breaded balls until the surface is pleasantly golden . Drain them and remove excess oil by patting them with paper towels . For a lighter dish, place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 350-400°F until golden. Once they have cooled slightly, all that remains is to enjoy your eggplant balls with a smoked cheese heart!
Consume the eggplant balls with a smoked cheese heart immediately. You can store them in the fridge well covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container for up to 1 day. If you wish to freeze them, let them cool and then transfer them to a container. Consume them as soon as possible and keep them in the freezer for no more than two months. Remove the eggplant balls with a smoked cheese heart from the freezer the night before and let them thaw in the fridge.
If you use round purple eggplants, you will get sweeter balls because their flesh contains fewer seeds and is sweeter. If you don't like smoked cheese, you can use another type of mild cheese of your preference, or replace the grated pecorino with Parmesan or Grana Padano. Additionally, if you want to give your eggplant balls a bolder or exotic flavor, you can add other aromas to the mixture, such as a bit of ground nutmeg or cumin seeds.
