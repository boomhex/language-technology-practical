instructions:
To make the Christmas tile, first line a 12-inch loaf pan with plastic food wrap . Pour the cream into a bowl, add the powdered sugar , and whip with an electric mixer until firm and stiff . Divide the whipped cream into 2 equal parts: use one part immediately for the filling, while keeping the other part in the refrigerator for decoration.
Take the mold and place 6 ladyfingers on the base , then brush the ladyfingers with the strained orange juice and cover with whipped cream .
Place some candied oranges on the cream and add half of the white chocolate chips , then form another layer of ladyfingers and moisten them with orange juice.
Continue in the same way by adding whipped cream, candied peel, and the remaining white chocolate chips . Finish with a final layer of ladyfingers and brush them with orange juice , then cover the mold with plastic wrap and refrigerate to set for about an hour.
Once the cooling time has elapsed, turn the mold over onto a serving plate and remove the plastic wrap. Cover the surface of the tile with whipped cream using a knife or spatula . Transfer the remaining whipped cream into a piping bag with a star nozzle and squeeze some tufts on both the edges and the sides . Finally, decorate with the red currants and some candied orange peel: your Christmas tile is ready to be served !
The Christmas tile can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, covered with plastic wrap. Alternatively, you can freeze it and consume it within 24 hours of thawing.
If you prefer, you can replace the ladyfingers with other types of cookies, for example, dry cocoa ones.
