Zuccotto di lasagne is something you might stumble upon in the charming region of Emilia-Romagna during a festive family get-together. And let me tell you, it’s really really impressive with its unique presentation. Picture this: a dome of tender egg pasta sheets enveloping a filling loaded with moist stewed veggies, savory ham cubes, and a creamy béchamel with melty fontina cheese. Pretty simple. It's a twist on the classic ricetta lasagne al forno , and makes it feel super special and fun.
In the north of Italy, people love adding their own flavor to lasagne, and here's the thing—this version gives you all the good stuff you want: golden pasta, lots of lasagne con fontina flavor, and that rich, lasagne con prosciutto taste—layered into a cool, dome-shaped style. Looks and tastes amazing. What sets zuccotto di lasagne apart from other lasagne con verdure or typical lasagne tradizionali italiane is how everything comes together.
And listen, the béchamel? It's silkier, thanks to the fontina, and the filling stays creamy without feeling heavy. The ham adds just the right saltiness, balancing out the sweet flavors from the veggies, while the pasta holds it all together with that tender bite you crave in good lasagne fatte in casa . Seriously good stuff.
It's one of those dishes that makes everyone stop and do a double take when it hits the table. Perfect for a special Sunday lunch or anytime you wanna impress a bit in the kitchen. Every slice has a bit of everything—crispy edges, a cheesy center, and all the savory goodness Emilia-Romagna is famous for. As far as primi piatti al forno go, this one’s way way better—a real crowd-pleaser and a tasty example of how cucina italiana keeps finding new ways to enjoy old favorites.
Whether you’re a seasoned cook or just love Italian food, this dish is sure to be a hit at your next gathering. For sure.
To prepare the lasagna dome with vegetables, fontina, and ham, start with the vegetables: remove the beard and green part from the leek , then peel it to remove the outermost layer and cut it into thin slices . Wash and trim the eggplants, then slice them into half-inch slices .
Then cut them into cubes ; wash and trim the zucchini, cut them in half lengthwise and then into wedges : then trim and peel the carrots with a vegetable peeler and dice them .
Remove the stem part of the champignon mushrooms (the one with more soil), then clean them with a slightly damp cloth or, if necessary, rinse them quickly in a bowl under cold running water; then dry them and slice them . In a saucepan, heat the olive oil, then add the leek and let it wilt for 3-4 minutes over low heat, stirring occasionally so that it doesn't stick to the bottom. Then add the carrots and let them cook for another 3-4 minutes. Then add the zucchini and let them cook for another 3-4 minutes.
At this point, also add the eggplants and peas , salt and pepper to taste, and let them cook for another 3 minutes. Finally, add the champignon mushrooms and chopped fresh thyme . Cover with a lid and let the vegetables stew for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the béchamel: heat the milk in a saucepan, dice the fontina and set it aside. In a saucepan, melt the butter over very low heat. Once melted, remove it from the heat and sprinkle in the flour , stirring with a whisk to create the roux; return to the heat and lightly toast the flour. Then add the previously heated milk, stirring constantly with the whisk until the béchamel thickens over low heat.
Flavor with nutmeg , then add the diced fontina and stir with the whisk until completely melted . Set the béchamel aside, meanwhile take the lasagna sheets, cook each sheet for about 3 minutes in boiling salted water .
After the necessary time, drain the sheets one by one with a slotted spoon and let them dry for a moment on a clean cloth . Once done, while the sheets are slightly drying, mix the vegetables with 1 cup of béchamel
and dice the cooked ham . Then brush the mold for the dome with olive oil, with a capacity of 1.5 quarts and a diameter of 8 inches . Line it with the cooked egg pasta sheets, placing them horizontally around the perimeter, slightly overlapping .
Also line the center so that there are no gaps , then pour in a layer of vegetable filling, add some diced cooked ham and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese .
Continue with layers of lasagna , vegetables, cooked ham, and cheese until the ingredients are finished: you should obtain 4 layers, trying to compact well. Finally, cover with more egg sheets and coat the base of the dome with half of the remaining béchamel, using the back of a spoon to spread it evenly . Bake in a preheated oven at 392°F for 30 minutes (if convection oven at 356°F for about 20 minutes).
Meanwhile, season the remaining béchamel with fresh thyme and, if you prefer, you can dilute it with a little milk and add a bit of grated cheese. Once ready, unmold the lasagna dome and let it cool, then invert it onto a tart pan (or an oven-safe plate) and coat the dome with the remaining béchamel . Return the lasagna dome to the oven to gratinate at 482°F (or the highest temperature) for 5 minutes. Then, remove the lasagna dome with vegetables, fontina, and ham from the oven and garnish with a few fresh thyme leaves. To serve, you can slice it to reveal the delicious filling !
The lasagna dome with vegetables, fontina, and ham can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
You can vary the filling with your preferred vegetables and substitute fontina with other types of cheese, such as Gruyère or Montasio.
