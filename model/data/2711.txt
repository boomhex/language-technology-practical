To make the phyllo dough triangles with broccoli and ricotta, start with the vegetables: wash the broccoli and separate the florets from the central stem , place the broccoli in a pot of boiling water and blanch them for a few minutes , then drain them with a slotted spoon and place them directly into a bowl with ice water ,
this will stop the cooking of the vegetables and keep their color vibrant. Pour a drizzle of oil into a pan and add the now cold broccoli , sauté them for a couple of minutes, season with salt and pepper, and turn off the heat . In another bowl, place the ricotta, then add the sautéed broccoli .
Drain the sun-dried tomatoes in oil and pat them dry with a paper towel, cut them into small pieces and incorporate them into the filling, season with salt and pepper and mix the mixture . Finally, flavor the filling with mint leaves .
Oil the work surface , lay down the first sheet and oil it over the entire surface , lay down the second and do the same procedure as with the third sheet .
Now cut with a smooth pastry cutter wheel strips 3 inches wide , distribute the filling with a spoon at the base of the rectangle and form the triangles: take the bottom left corner of the rectangle and fold it in half over the long side of the dough rectangle
to create a triangle . Continue wrapping the dough triangle onto itself to the end of the strip (17-18).
You will have created triangular rolls , continue with the remaining phyllo dough. You will get 12 triangles, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , brush the surface with oil and sprinkle the surface with sesame seeds . Bake the triangles in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 20-25 minutes (in a convection oven at 356°F for 15-20 minutes). Once baking is finished, remove the phyllo triangles with broccoli and ricotta from the oven and let them cool before serving.
Once cooked, you can store the phyllo dough triangles with broccoli and ricotta in the refrigerator for a couple of days in an airtight container. Phyllo dough is sold frozen, so it is not possible to freeze the rolls.
Unleash your imagination by trying other fillings, for example, you can replace the broccoli with artichokes or spinach, and enhance with other tasty ingredients like ham, olives, or even anchovies!
