instructions:
To prepare baked stuffed calamari, first handle the cleaning of the calamari. Remove the head and wings from the calamari. Remove eyes and beak from the head and strip the skin from the tentacles and body . After rinsing everything well , cut both the wings and tentacles into small pieces , leaving the sac whole.
Soak the raisins in cold water for at least 10 minutes . Toast the pine nuts in a non-stick pan for a few minutes . Finely chop the onion .
Also chop a bunch of parsley and set it aside. Pour a drizzle of oil in a pan, add the chopped onion , and let it soften. Add the anchovies and let them melt with the heat.
Also add the squeezed raisins and pine nuts . Finally, add the small pieces of calamari and let them brown for a few minutes.
Turn off the heat and add the breadcrumbs , then season with salt, a pinch of chili pepper , and plenty of chopped parsley .
Pour the water and mix. This way, the filling will be softer and more moist. Take the calamari sacs and fill them with the mixture , then seal the ends using toothpicks .
Place the calamari in a baking dish, then pour in the white wine and a drizzle of oil . Add some of the leftover filling on top .
Bake the stuffed calamari in a preheated convection oven at 375°F for 7-8 minutes. Remove the baking dish from the oven, turn them over, and add any remaining filling on top . Drizzle with a little oil and continue cooking for another 7-8 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve the baked stuffed calamari with the cooking sauce .
You can store baked stuffed calamari in the fridge for up to 1-2 days, in a container with an airtight seal.
If you prefer, you can also add capers to the filling. In this case, desalt them well and evaluate whether to add salt to the preparation.
