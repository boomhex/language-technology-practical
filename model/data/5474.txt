instructions:
Swordfish carpaccio with green mustard sauce is a fresh, light, and tasty main course, perfect for warm summer evenings. The green mustard sauce which accompanies it is made with oil, parsley, pine nuts, vinegar, and old style mustard. The whole and crunchy seeds of the mustard make this dressing particularly flavorful and suitable for the natural and mild taste of swordfish.
To prepare the swordfish carpaccio with green mustard sauce, start by making the sauce: place the bunch of parsley in a blender, then add the pine nuts , a tablespoon of white wine vinegar , and extra virgin olive oil, and blend until you get a homogeneous and creamy sauce.
Pour the obtained sauce into a small bowl, adjust with salt and add two teaspoons of old style mustard , mix well to incorporate it. It is important not to put the old-fashioned mustard in the blender with the other ingredients, as you should not crush the seeds; they should remain whole and crunchy. Place the swordfish carpaccio on a bed of salad greens, brush it with some oil to prevent it from drying out , and sprinkle it with the freshly prepared sauce. Let it marinate for 20 minutes and then serve, preferably at room temperature.
If the taste of old style mustard is too acidic for you, you can omit the tablespoon of vinegar in the sauce preparation or replace it with a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar cream to make the dressing less tangy.
