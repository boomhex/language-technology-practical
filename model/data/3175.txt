instructions:
To prepare the gluten-free custard, first pour the milk into a saucepan, add the vanilla seeds , lemon zest , and cinnamon . Stir and bring to a boil.
Meanwhile, in a bowl, place the sugar, add the salt , rice starch , and potato starch , and mix quickly.
At this point, add the egg yolks and mix immediately to avoid lumps. When the milk is about to boil, pour it into the bowl through a strainer to filter out the lemon zest.
Stir once more and transfer everything back into the saucepan and cook over low heat for 8-10 minutes until it thickens. Stir often and when you see the first bubbles forming, remove from heat. Transfer the custard to a bowl and let it cool slightly.
Cover with cling film in contact and let it rest in the fridge for 1-2 hours. You can then use it as you wish, but you can also enjoy it with a spoon, placing it in a small bowl and decorating with some raspberries . The gluten-free custard is ready to be served .
The gluten-free custard can be stored in the refrigerator, covered with cling film in contact, for 2-3 days.
Alternatively, it can be frozen for 1 month.
You can vary the taste of your gluten-free custard by adding chopped dark chocolate when the custard is still hot, or by dissolving instant coffee in the hot milk.
