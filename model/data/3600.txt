To prepare the omelette with monk's beard, start by cleaning the monk's beard: remove the reddish end and wash the monk's beard carefully under running water , then boil it in a pot with salted water for about ten minutes. Drain it well, place it on a cutting board, and cut it into rough pieces , leaving the strands still quite long.
Cut the primosale into not too small cubes and the speck into strips . In a bowl, beat the eggs .
Now add the monk's beard , the Grana Padano , the primosale ,
and the bacon . Mix all the ingredients with a fork, then salt and pepper .  Put the oil in a pan and heat it ,
when it's hot, pour in the mixture and cover with a lid . Cook for about ten minutes over medium-low heat and then, using the lid, flip the omelette, turning it over and letting it slide back into the pan. Let it cook for another 5 minutes on the other side without the lid .
