To prepare linguine with clams and crispy peppers, start by purging the clams that you have soaked for an hour in a bowl with cold water and coarse salt. Measure the salt considering it should correspond to 10% of the water volume . After the purging time, drain the clams .
In a pan, pour a drizzle of olive oil, parsley stems, a clove of garlic with skin on, and the chili pepper cut in half . Let the oil heat until very hot, then add the clams and immediately cover with a lid .
After about a minute, deglaze with white wine , cover again with the lid and let cook for about 2-3 minutes until they open. At this point, turn off the heat and drain the clams through a sieve, collecting the cooking liquid in a bowl ; it will be used later in the preparation.
Now gather the clam meat in a bowl and discard the empty shells ; it is very important to also discard any clams that did not open during cooking because they are full of sand. Cover the clam meat with a small part of the cooking liquid so they don't dry out . Store the clams in the refrigerator and prepare the parsley butter: finely chop only the parsley leaves and mix them with cubed butter that you have left at room temperature for about 30 minutes .
Mix well with a spatula to combine the mixture , then cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator . Continue with the garlic oil: in a tall narrow jug, pour the olive oil and the clove of garlic, peeled and with its inner germ removed .
Blend with an immersion blender to obtain a homogeneous sauce and set aside. Now take the stale bread and remove the crust .
Cut the crumb into cubes , transfer it to a bowl, and season with a drizzle of oil and salt .
Toast the bread in a pan with a drizzle of olive oil . When they are golden and crispy , transfer the bread cubes onto a tray lined with paper towels to drain the excess oil .
Now proceed to prepare the crispy peppers: heat the seed oil in a saucepan to 300°F, then immerse the crispy peppers using a slotted spoon , the cooking must be very quick otherwise they will soak up oil and become bitter. Drain them as soon as they open and place them on the same tray with paper towels where you put the bread cubes .
Once cooled, chop the crispy peppers and bread together to obtain crumbs . Set aside and boil the linguine in salted boiling water .
In the meantime, heat a drizzle of oil in a pan with ground black pepper , add a ladle of clam cooking water and heat well. After 5 minutes, drain the linguine and add them directly to the pan . Adjust the flavor by adding pasta cooking water, if already flavorful, or clam cooking water if it's a bit bland.
When there is one minute left for cooking, add the clams , then turn off the heat and complete the seasoning with more cooking water if necessary . Wait a moment, then season with one and a half tablespoons of parsley oil .
Add a tablespoon of anchovy sauce and the cold parsley butter from the fridge . Stir in a splash of oil and mix the pasta well to make it creamy. Immediately plate the linguine .
Add the remaining clams from the bottom of the pan and finish with the mix of crispy pepper and bread . Finally, garnish with grated lemon zest. Your linguine with clams and crispy peppers are ready to be served !
We recommend consuming the linguine with clams and crispy peppers immediately.
You can prepare in advance the parsley-flavored butter, garlic oil, and the mix of fried crispy peppers and toasted bread.
When plucking parsley, be very careful to remove all parts of the stem as they have a rather invasive herbaceous flavor.
The leftover stale bread can be used to make meatballs.
Clams that did not open during cooking should be discarded because they contain sand inside.
