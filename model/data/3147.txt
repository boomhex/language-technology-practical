instructions:
To prepare the Yule log of pandoro, first, cut the pandoro into vertical slices and remove the dark outer part . Place the slices on the work surface to form a rectangle and flatten them with a rolling pin to seal them together .
Move on to the cream: in a bowl, put the ricotta, the mascarpone , and the powdered sugar . Start whipping with an electric beater, then add the cream slowly .
You should obtain a whipped and frothy mixture . Spread the base of pandoro with sour cherry jam , then add about two-thirds of the ricotta and mascarpone cream, using a spatula to cover the entire surface . Transfer the remaining cream to a piping bag with a flat, grooved nozzle and keep it in the fridge until ready to use.
Gently roll up the pandoro base , wrap the roll in plastic wrap and twist the ends like a candy . Let it rest in the freezer for 3 hours or in the refrigerator overnight.
After the resting time, place the Yule log on a serving plate and cover the outside with the remaining cream . Your Yule log of pandoro is ready to be served !
The Yule log of pandoro can be stored in the refrigerator, wrapped in plastic wrap or inside a closed container, for 2-3 days.
Instead of sour cherry jam, you can use your favorite jam, such as mixed berries or raspberry.
For a more indulgent version, you can replace the jam with a spreadable chocolate or hazelnut cream, adding chopped hazelnuts or almonds for a crunchy note!
