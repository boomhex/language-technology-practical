To prepare the orecchiette with creamy broccoli, pumpkin, and pomegranate, start by cleaning the broccoli. Wash it thoroughly and remove the base of the stem if it appears dark. Then separate the stem from the top and peel the stem . Detach the green florets from the lighter base of the crown .
Cut the stem into chunks , then gather the greenest and liveliest florets in one place, which you will set aside for later; in another, the stem chunks and the light bases of the broccoli florets . Then take care of the broccoli cream, for which you will use stem and light parts. Slice the shallot thinly
Place it in a saucepan and let it wither for a few minutes with the extra virgin olive oil. Add the stems , brown them for a couple of minutes, and deglaze with the water .
Simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes until the broccoli is very tender. Add the fresh oregano , adjust the salt, transfer to a blender jar , and blend into a cream with an immersion blender. Add the robiola cheese ,
mix with a spatula to incorporate it evenly, and season with pepper . Set the cream aside. In the meantime, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Peel and dice the pumpkin , pour it into the pot
along with the green broccoli florets , and blanch for 4-5 minutes. Drain the vegetables and immediately place them in a bowl with cold water and ice to stop cooking and fix the color . Then let them drain in a colander.
Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and toss in the orecchiette . While they cook, heat the oil, whole chili pepper, and halved garlic in a large pan, lightly fry, and then add the well-drained vegetables . Toss them over high heat for a few minutes, deglazing if necessary with a bit of pasta cooking water, and season with salt and pepper .
Remove the chili pepper and garlic , drain the orecchiette , and add them to the pan .
Sauté for a minute, meanwhile cut the pomegranate in half and collect the seeds . Add the pomegranate seeds to the pasta ,
the fresh oregano , and mix well. Plate by spreading some broccoli and robiola cream on the bottom of the dishes and finishing with a generous amount of orecchiette! The orecchiette with broccoli cream, pumpkin, and pomegranate are ready to enjoy !
Orecchiette with creamy broccoli, pumpkin, and pomegranate should be consumed immediately. Freezing is not recommended. You can keep the broccoli and robiola cream in the fridge covered for up to 1 day. Blanched vegetables can be stored in the fridge for 2-3 days.
If you want to make the most of the precious vitamins and minerals contained in seasonal vegetables, you can cook the pasta in the same water used for cooking pumpkin and broccoli tops: your orecchiette will be even tastier and certainly more nutritious!
