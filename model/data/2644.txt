To prepare the spelt brioche, start by pouring the dry yeast into the warm milk (you can also use fresh yeast, in this case the dose is 12 g), stir to dissolve it completely ; also pour the salt into room temperature water and stir to dissolve it. Then pour the 00 flour, Manitoba, and spelt flour into the bowl of a mixer .
Add the sugar and start working the mixture with the K beater; then slowly pour in the milk in which you dissolved the yeast . Work the dough for a few minutes until the milk has been absorbed, then add the two whole eggs and the yolk, little by little and continue mixing until completely absorbed.
Add the water in which you dissolved the salt and when it is absorbed, stop the mixer and replace the beater with the dough hook; then add the softened butter one piece at a time , waiting for it to blend before adding the next. Work the dough at medium speed for about 20 minutes. Then, when it is smooth and elastic, stop the mixer ,
place the dough on a work surface and handle it briefly to form a round shape, then put it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap : let it rise for at least 30 minutes. After the necessary time, the dough will have doubled in volume . Then take it and roll it out slightly to form a rectangle about 12 inches long
Roll it to form a log and place it seam side down in a 12x4.5 inch loaf pan lined with parchment paper . Brush the surface with the egg beaten with a tablespoon of milk ,
Sprinkle the surface with sesame and poppy seeds , then let it rise in the oven turned off with the light on until it reaches the rim, it will take about 40-50 minutes ; at this point, bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 40 minutes (320°F for about 30 minutes if using a convection oven). Once cooked, remove from the oven and let it cool slightly, then turn it out to cool on a wire rack . Your spelt brioche is ready to be sliced and enjoyed!
You can store the spelt brioche in a food bag or under a glass dome for 1-2 days.
You can freeze the raw dough after the first rise or cooked, only if you used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
You can enrich the spelt brioche with pumpkin seeds, flaxseeds, or walnuts. If you decide to use it to enrich the bread basket for your dinners, even with chopped olives, maybe distributed in the dough before rolling it so that, once cooked and sliced, the filling appears in a spiral shape!
