To prepare the crispy salmon fillet with Chardonnay sauce, first start preparing the accompanying sauce: chop the shallot , slice all 280 g of champignon mushrooms , then take a large pan, pour some oil
and sauté the shallot for about 4-5 minutes, add all the champignon mushrooms, deglaze with the Chardonnay wine
let it evaporate, then salt , pepper , and cook over low heat for 4-5 minutes. Once cooked, transfer 80 g of the mushrooms into a tall glass for an immersion blender, keep the other 200 g aside: they will be used to accompany the fillets. Blend the mushrooms with an immersion blender .
Add the milk to obtain a creamier mixture and set it aside . Focus on the salmon: remove the bones with kitchen pliers and the skin with a sharp knife if present.
then, on a plate, place some white sesame seeds and a bit of salt and bread the fillets by covering them well , then heat a non-stick pan well and place them to cook for about 2 minutes per side, being careful to turn them occasionally so they cook evenly.
Once the salmon is cooked, on a serving plate, place some whole mushrooms set aside and the salmon fillets. Adjust with pepper , drizzle with a little raw oil, and serve with the mushroom and Chardonnay cream you prepared and set aside in a sauceboat, garnish with a few parsley leaves, and your crispy salmon fillets with Chardonnay sauce are ready to be enjoyed!
It is preferable to consume the salmon fillets just prepared, while the sauce and also the mushrooms can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 days, covered in the refrigerator.
You can accompany the salmon with baked or boiled potatoes instead of champignon mushrooms, and if you don't have Chardonnay, you can deglaze with another white wine, like Pinot or Vermentino.
