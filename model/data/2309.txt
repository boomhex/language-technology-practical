Monkfish with fresh tomato sauce is a classic dish from the sunny coasts of Italy, where they really celebrate simple yet flavorful meals. This monkfish recipe is all about the tender fish, known for its meaty texture and, importantly, no tiny bones—yeah, that's a big plus! It’s a favorite in regions like Liguria and Campania. The real magic here? Letting the sweet taste of ripe tomatoes steal the show. With a light sauce of fresh tomato sauce , basil, and just a hint of garlic, the moist and delicate flavor of the fish is seriously good. You get a dish that feels special but doesn’t need any fancy ingredients. For real, that's the charm of Italian cuisine.
