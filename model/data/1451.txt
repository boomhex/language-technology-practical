instructions:
To make the Mediterranean fennel cakes, first thinly slice the fennel using a mandolin slicer (1-2). Wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them into thin slices .
Cut the cheese first into strips and then into cubes . Now take some aluminum molds, 4 inches in diameter and with a height of 1.25 inches. Melt the butter and butter the bottom and sides using a pastry brush.
Now sprinkle the entire inner surface with breadcrumbs . At this point, you can fill your molds: place a layer of fennel at the bottom , then one of cherry tomatoes and flavor with capers (previously desalinated) ,
some cheese cubes and sliced olives . Now cover with another layer of fennel . Spread breadcrumbs on the surface
and a small piece of butter . Place your molds on a baking tray and bake in a static oven preheated to 356°F for 30 minutes, with the last 5 minutes under the grill. Once cooked, the Mediterranean fennel cakes will be well gratinated, serve them hot !
The Mediterranean fennel cakes can be stored for a couple of days in the refrigerator. We do not recommend freezing.
If you do not like Edam and prefer a more delicate taste, you can replace it with a mild local cheese from your area.
