Dolce uovo di Pasqua is one of those Italian desserts that just feels right for spring. All across Italy, you’ll spot this eye-catching treat at Easter. It's really a rich, creamy chocolate pudding shaped like an egg, with tons of decorazioni pasquali to give it that wow effect on any table. Honestly, using a mold that really brings out that uovo di Pasqua look is the classic move, so when you pop it out, it already gets people talking. And look, what sets this dessert apart isn’t just how it looks, but how smooth and moist it feels when you take a bite—think of a fancier version of your usual chocolate pudding, but all dressed up for the holiday.
People love topping it with fluffy whipped cream and loads of fresh berries. Super tasty. That combo makes every slice a little bit special. Compared to other dolci di Pasqua regionali , like the famous colomba or pastiera napoletana, this one brings a little extra fun and playfulness, perfect for a family gathering or a buffet where you want something both tasty and good-looking. It’s not all about the looks though—this dolce pasquale is pretty easy to make, so you can surprise your crew without stressing out in the kitchen.
I mean, the real charm comes from using good dark chocolate, almost like the kind you’d find in cioccolato artigianale shops, and letting it set in that egg-shaped form. Some folks get really really into the soft, velvety texture, especially with the tender bite of the pudding against the light whipped cream and the fresh, tangy berries on top. When you set it out next to traditional Easter cookies or those bright Italian biscotti, it stands out as a creative ricetta uovo di Pasqua that’s still totally you. Friends and family usually can’t resist snapping pics before digging in, so it’s safe to say this dessert turns a regular meal into something that feels like a party.
In the end, it’s a smart way to give your Easter table some Italian flair, without needing a ton of special skills—just a love of chocolate and a taste for some holiday fun. For real.
To prepare the Easter egg dessert, coarsely chop the dark chocolate , if you prefer you can use a mixer to chop it. Then pour the sifted flour into the cold milk and mix with a fork until all lumps are dissolved, set aside the mixture obtained. Place a large high-sided saucepan on the stove, pour in the cream ,
and the milk and flour mixture through a sieve to catch any lumps, heat over low heat then, always stirring with a whisk, add the butter and sugar , in this phase it is very important to always stir and cook over low heat, continue stirring until everything has melted and the mixture begins to simmer,
at this point add the chopped dark chocolate . Stir for a few minutes until the mixture thickens and becomes completely smooth and velvety . Take an Easter egg-shaped mold with a capacity of 1 quart
and a tray that can hold it so it doesn't tip over. Pour the mixture into the mold , level it with a spatula , and let it cool, then put it in the freezer covered with plastic wrap until completely hardened, for about 2-3 hours.
Now unmold the pudding, turn the mold upside down and immerse it in a pot full of warm water (or under a stream of warm running water) and then flip it onto a serving plate , this way the mold will come off more easily. Finally, garnish the pudding: whip the fresh cream with a tablespoon of powdered sugar , for more details on the cream see the Cooking School sheet How to Whip Cream
pour it into a piping bag and make small tufts on the egg . Cut the strawberries into small slices. Garnish with the berries , strawberry slices , and mint leaves. The Easter egg dessert is now ready to be served!
You can store the Easter egg dessert in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for no more than 3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Have fun varying the decoration: chopped hazelnuts and pine nuts instead of berries, tufts of fresh cream colored with food colorings and gently arranged with the help of a piping bag.
