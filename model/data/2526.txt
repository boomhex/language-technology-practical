instructions:
To prepare the French meringue (basic dough) wreaths, take the eggs and separate the yolks from the whites. Pour the egg whites into a stand mixer with a whisk attachment and start beating them until stiff peaks form; sift the powdered sugar into a bowl and add it one tablespoon at a time to the egg whites .
Continue with the stand mixer until you obtain a white and fluffy meringue . Using a spatula, place the meringue you have obtained into a piping bag with a star tip nozzle .
At this point, you can make your wreaths in 2 variants: on a greased baking sheet lined with parchment paper, make meringue dollops next to each other forming a circle . Continue with the next ones by making a circular motion to obtain another type of decoration ; finally, distribute the silver sugar beads over the wreaths you have created . Once done, let the meringues dry in a ventilated oven at 212°F for at least 3 hours, keeping the door slightly open.
When the meringues are ready , let them cool, then decorate them with colored satin ribbons : your meringue wreaths are ready !
You can make your meringue wreaths and hang them on the Christmas tree: they will last about 1 month. Freezing is not recommended.
You can personalize your meringues by adding a touch of extra originality: add powdered food coloring to get fantastic colored meringues to make your holiday tree even more beautiful!
