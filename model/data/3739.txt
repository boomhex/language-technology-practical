Sweet yet savory , these stuffed dates shine as a top choice for family-friendly parties and gatherings. Golden brown color and slightly firm feel in your hand — that's what you notice first when serving easy appetizers like these. Families love the way Medjool dates bring a natural, satisfying sweetness that’s hard to miss, while the creamy center of goat cheese stuffed dates delivers a nice, rich contrast that's always welcome on snack tables. With their good chewy texture and bite-sized presentation, they add a sense of special occasion even to everyday moments. Quick appetizers become EASY (really!) when you put out a plate of these; friends and family reach for them just because the flavor and the sweet-meets-salty combo are tough to resist. Whether it’s a laid-back family movie night or something a little more festive, like holiday spreads or game day, you’ll see these stuffed dates disappearing fast at almost any gathering.
Practical home cooks appreciate how goat cheese stuffed dates work for big parties as well as little family snacking moments—they easily fill that spot between “healthy snack” and “fun treat.” Great for making snack platters seem more special , and because these are naturally gluten-free, they fit in alongside other homemade appetizers so everyone can have a taste (handy tip: a few walnut halves bring an extra crunch , or you can drizzle honey on top for another layer of flavor). Families banking on easy appetizers for weeknights, school events, or quick crowd-pleasers will tell you they’re reliable—kids get curious, adults get hooked, and you can play around with fillings or flavors to match your group’s favorite sweet recipes or if you want more of a savory spin. Presentation stays pretty with minimal effort—looks nice for parties, potlucks, and even busy weekdays when you want something out of the ordinary but not fussy. Most find the stuffed dates work in all kinds of situations, from appetizers for holiday tables to last-minute gatherings, making everyone happy with this simple, DELICIOUS treat that’s always welcome at home.
Slice the dates lengthwise (but without cutting them in half) and remove the pit. In a bowl, work the ricotta with a wooden spoon, then add the fresh cream and whip it all together for about 5 minutes.
Add the sugar, mix everything well, and stuff the dates.
If you don't consume the stuffed dates immediately, store them in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap.
