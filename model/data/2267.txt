From the sun-drenched kitchens of Southern Italy, there's this really special twist on a classic: salmon timbale with zucchini. Think of those traditional timbales from places like Naples or Sicily, but here, you get something a bit different—tender grilled zucchini and moist Norwegian salmon. And look, the dish usually shows up as cute single servings, so everyone gets their own little surprise. Pretty much. Thin strips of zucchini are wrapped around a filling of mashed potatoes and rich salmon, so each bite is both creamy and just a bit crispy from the grilled edges. What really really makes this zucchini timbale pop is a sprinkle of smoked salt, which gives the whole thing a rustic and slightly aromatic edge. This isn’t your average starter—it’s got an elegant look that gets everyone talking as soon as it hits the table.
A salmon and zucchini recipe like this works especially well when you’re having friends over and want something that feels a bit fancy, without being too complicated. The combo of sweet zucchini with the salty, flavorful salmon turns into a mix that’s hard to beat, and the layers inside give you that Southern Italian vibe, even though the salmon is a nod to more international flavors. And the sauce? Folks in the south of Italy have always loved their timballi for big gatherings, and this version keeps that tradition but brings in something new. For real.
Whether you call it a zucchini and salmon appetizer or even a kind of salmon and zucchini terrine , the result is always eye-catching and super super tasty. It fits right in with easy salmon recipes and healthy zucchini dishes, but still feels a little special. Serve it up warm or at room temp—either way, the golden look and the savory smell are sure to get your guests excited. This is the kind of food that surprises people in the best way and might even start a conversation about who gets the last piece! Add a glass of crisp white wine to really complete the experience and make your meal.
To prepare the salmon and zucchini timbale, start by heating a pot with plenty of water. Bring to a boil and cook the potatoes of equal size for about 30-40 minutes . The time may vary depending on the size of the potatoes used: test with the tines of a fork to check for doneness (alternatively you can cook with a pressure cooker to halve the cooking time). While the potatoes are cooking, focus on the zucchinis: wash and dry them, then trim them . Slice them into slices about 1/8 inch thick using a mandoline .
Place them in a shallow and wide container slightly overlapping and drizzle with 1.5 tablespoons of oil , so they will maintain a bright color even during cooking. Meanwhile, heat a grill and when it is hot, cook the zucchinis for 1-2 minutes. Halfway through cooking, using kitchen tongs, flip them to cook on the other side for another 1-2 minutes . Once ready, place them back in the same container and set aside. Now take the salmon: remove the bones with kitchen tweezers and if your salmon fillet has skin, cut it away with a sharp knife, trying not to remove the flesh.
Cut it into strips, then into cubes about 1/3 inch per side . Also set the salmon aside. At this point, the potatoes will be cooked: mash them with a potato masher in a large bowl (you do not need to peel them if you use a potato masher) . Adjust with pepper .
Season with smoked salt and with previously washed and dried thyme leaves . Then, add the salmon .
Pour 1.5 tablespoons of oil and gently mix the ingredients to avoid mashing the fish: you can use your hands or a spatula if you prefer. At this point, take 4 molds of 6 oz each and brush the walls with about 1 teaspoon of oil .
Line the molds by arranging the grilled zucchinis in a radial pattern, starting from the center of the mold : part of the zucchini will extend outside the edge and will be used to close your timbales later. You must cover all the walls of the mold with zucchinis. Salt the center and pour the potato and salmon mixture .
Then, bring the zucchinis one at a time towards the center to completely cover the heart of potatoes and salmon . Adjust with a pinch of salt and brush the surface of the molds with about 1 teaspoon of oil .
Place the molds on a baking sheet and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 15 minutes (if using a convection oven, 320°F for about 6 minutes should be sufficient) . Once ready, take them out of the oven and let them rest for a few minutes to firm up. Then, unmold them directly onto the plate where you will serve them and enjoy your salmon and zucchini timbale !
We recommend consuming the salmon and zucchini timbale as soon as it is ready. Once cooked, you can decide to store it in the refrigerator, if there are leftovers, covered with plastic wrap for up to 1 day.
We do not recommend freezing.
If you do not have much time available, you can also decide to grill the zucchinis in advance. However, we do not recommend preparing the potatoes in advance.
Fancy spicing it up? Add or replace thyme with parsley; smoked salt can be substituted with traditional salt, and white pepper can be replaced with black pepper. If you want to give an even more original and fresh note to the mixture, try adding a grated zest of untreated lime!
