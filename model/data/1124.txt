instructions:
To prepare the eggless meatballs, place the ground meat mix in a bowl. Add the water and plain yogurt . Salt and season with paprika ,
add the ground ginger and grated lemon zest. Mix to combine ,
Now you need to add a little breadcrumbs at a time , mix again . You should achieve a homogeneous, soft yet compact mixture, so you need to adjust the exact amount of breadcrumbs to use (you will need about 1 oz). Form balls weighing 1 oz each , you'll get about 18 of them.
Pour a splash of oil in a pan, turn on the heat, add a clove of garlic and let it infuse . When it starts to brown, remove it, add the meatballs and let them brown well on all sides .
Add a bit of hot water , cover with a lid , and let cook for 10 minutes on low heat. Serve your meatballs hot !
Eggless meatballs can be stored for a couple of days in the refrigerator. We recommend heating them before serving.
Alternatively, they can be frozen both raw and cooked.
Meatballs can also be cooked with tomato. After browning them, add good tomato puree and let them cook covered for about 15 minutes on low heat. If you prefer, you can add grated cheese to the mixture.
