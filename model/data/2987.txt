Granita Bellini is a classic from the Veneto region that brings a bit of sparkle to any summer gathering. Inspired by the famous Bellini cocktail—first mixed by Giuseppe Cipriani at Venice’s Harry’s Bar in 1948—this cool treat takes the sweet flavor of white peaches and the bubbly kick of Prosecco, turning them into a frozen dessert that's both light and super refreshing. Really, it's awesome. The peach granita has this pale, slightly pink hue—kinda fancy—like the painter Bellini, and it just feels fancy when served in a flûte glass. No heavy cream or anything rich here, just water, sugar, fruit, and some good Italian fizz—so you get a Bellini granita that’s really easy to enjoy, even on the hottest days.
Across Venice and the wider Veneto, everyone has their own twist on this peach Bellini granita . Some folks use more peach for a stronger fruit flavor, while others lean towards a Prosecco granita for extra zest. And here's the thing, no matter the variation, the key is keeping it icy and not too heavy, which is exactly what you want from Italian frozen desserts. This frozen peach treat just hits differently at the end of a meal or as a cool starter before dinner, especially when it’s super hot out. People love how it feels so smooth and crisp at the same time, making it a go-to for anyone looking for summer dessert recipes with a touch of elegance. Whether you’re after something fun for a dinner party or just want to treat yourself, homemade granita like this always brings that little bit of Venetian charm to your table.
Plus, don't forget, a touch of fresh mint or a slice of peach on top can make your granita look as tempting as it tastes, adding a touch of beauty to your presentation. Really really nice.
To prepare the Bellini granita, start with the syrup: place the sugar in a small saucepan , pour in the Prosecco , and add the water . Let the sugar dissolve and bring to a near boil. Then turn off the heat and let the syrup cool.
In the meantime, peel the peaches , remove the pit, cut them into slices , and place them in a blender .
Blend the peach slices until you obtain a smooth mixture . Then transfer the peach puree to a wide, shallow container to facilitate freezing, and add the now-cool syrup . Mix everything together and place in the freezer. After 30 minutes, break the ice crystals that have formed with the tines of a fork .
Repeat the process three more times: place the granita back in the freezer and every 30 minutes take it out to mix the mixture with a fork, until you achieve the consistency of granita . At this point, pour the granita into flûte glasses , decorate with a few mint leaves, and garnish the glass with peach slices , your Bellini granita is ready to be enjoyed!
Store the Bellini granita in the freezer for up to a week.
For the series "seeking new drinks": you can replace peaches with the fruit of your choice, as long as you name your granita after a musician! Whatever fruit you use, if the taste is too "adagio" for you, you can flavor it by adding a vanilla bean to the syrup: "allegro", don't you think?
