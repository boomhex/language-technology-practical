instructions:
To prepare the hazelnut and chocolate spread, place the hazelnut paste in a large bowl; add the vegetable oil and a pinch of salt . Split a vanilla bean lengthwise ;
extract the seeds by scraping them with a knife and add them to the hazelnut paste mixture . Mix with a spatula to blend all the ingredients well .
Chop the milk chocolate with a knife and melt it in a double boiler, making sure the water in the pot doesn't touch the bottom of the bowl holding the chocolate (alternatively, you can melt it in the microwave: heat for a few seconds on high power, turn it off, then stir and repeat the process until fully melted). Once the chocolate has completely melted , turn off the heat.
Add the melted chocolate and sifted cocoa powder to the hazelnut paste and mix very well until you get a smooth and homogeneous cream; if you find lumps, you can blend the cream with an immersion blender. Sterilize the airtight jars, let them cool, and then fill them with the cream . Close the lid and place in the refrigerator to set for at least 20 minutes. Once ready, you can use the hazelnut and chocolate spread to fill slices of bread and prepare tasty snacks!
You can store the hazelnut and chocolate spread in a cool, dry place for about 2 weeks. It is not recommended to store it in the refrigerator or to freeze it.
You can find hazelnut paste in cake design stores, pastry shops, or well-stocked grocery stores. Want to make your spread even tastier? Simple! Just replace the vanilla bean seeds with ground cinnamon or a spice mix of cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger: these flavors pair perfectly with hazelnut and chocolate!
