They've got this knack for swapping in local, seasonal stuff. Pretty much. So, no surprise this pumpkin dessert recipe fits perfectly when the leaves start to fall.

To prepare the pumpkin panna cotta, first clean the pumpkin by removing the seeds and internal fibers , then remove the skin and cut the pulp into cubes; you will need 200 g (about 7 oz). Line a bamboo steamer with parchment paper ; if you have another type of steamer, you don't need to use parchment paper.
Transfer the pumpkin cubes to the steamer and cover with the lid. Pour about 2 inches of water into a wok or a pan , place the steamer on top, and cook the pumpkin for 10 minutes .
Once cooked, transfer the pumpkin to a blender and blend to make a puree , then strain it through a sieve .
Soak the gelatin sheets in the milk for at least 10 minutes . Meanwhile, pour the cream and sugar into a saucepan , add the pumpkin puree , and mix with a hand whisk.
Place the saucepan on the stove and cook on low heat for 10 minutes, then add the well-squeezed gelatin sheets . Stir quickly to dissolve the gelatin evenly and turn off the heat. Pour the mixture into 4 individual molds, about 3 inches in diameter, single-use or silicone, and let cool , then put in the refrigerator to set for at least 2 hours.
Prepare the cocoa topping: sift the cocoa into a saucepan where you have poured the water , add the sugar , and cook over low heat for 10 minutes, stirring with a hand whisk .
After this time, transfer the topping to a bowl and let it cool, stirring occasionally: this way it will thicken . Once set, gently remove the panna cotta from the mold by running a knife blade along the entire edge . Garnish the pumpkin panna cotta with the cocoa topping and, if desired, with chopped hazelnuts !
Pumpkin panna cotta can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
You can freeze it after cooking; let it thaw in the refrigerator before consuming.
If you don't have a steamer, you can boil the pumpkin; in this case, we recommend letting it drain after cooking to remove excess water.
Instead of the butternut squash, you can use kabocha squash.
The milk for dissolving the gelatin can be replaced with cold water.
