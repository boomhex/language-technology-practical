instructions:
To prepare scialatielli with seafood, first wash the clams, then place them in a bowl and add about 1 tablespoon of salt . Cover them with water and let them purge for an hour. Then also clean the mussels .
Clean the shrimp as well , making sure to leave the head and remove the internal vein by making an incision on the back . Take a sprig of parsley and strip it , keeping the stems aside.
Finely chop the leaves . In a pan, pour a drizzle of oil, the parsley stems, and a clove of garlic . Let it flavor for a couple of minutes, raise the heat, and add the mussels and clams .
If necessary, add a little water to facilitate opening and cover with a lid . Place a strainer over a bowl and as the mussels and clams open, remove them with tongs
and transfer them into the strainer. Once they are all open, also pour the cooking liquid to filter it and collect it in the bowl , you will use it later. Place a pot on the stove, filled with water, salted to taste, which will be used for cooking the pasta. In the same pan, add a drizzle of oil and another clove of garlic . When hot, place the shrimp inside and cook them on one side only for a couple of minutes over medium-high heat.
Then add the peeled tomatoes and lower the heat so it doesn't splatter too much. Add a bit of the reserved bivalve cooking liquid to thin it. Cook for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, remove the empty halves of the mussels and clams , then also remove the garlic and parsley stems.
After 7 minutes, remove the garlic from the sauce and add the mussels and clams . Let it flavor and turn off the heat. Then cook the scialatielli
and 2-3 minutes before the cooking time is up, drain them and transfer them to the sauce . Turn the heat back on, add more bivalve cooking liquid and finish cooking. Adjust with salt and pepper, then add a drizzle of oil and the chopped parsley. Mix the pasta well and serve it!
We recommend consuming the scialatielli immediately. Alternatively, the sauce can be stored for a day in the refrigerator.
Taste the mussel and clam cooking water, as it might be too salty in which case it should be used sparingly or slightly diluted with water.
Scialatielli with seafood will be perfect for special occasion menus, such as the Christmas Eve of Christmas for example!
