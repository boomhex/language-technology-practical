Place the flour in a mound; make a well in the center and break the eggs inside . Add a pinch of salt and knead until you get a smooth and elastic dough. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. To prepare the filling, carefully clean the Swiss chard leaves. Discard the central part of each leaf, which is tougher , and cut the rest into strips. Boil the chard in slightly salted boiling water for 5 minutes or until tender. Drain and squeeze them well .
In a bowl, mix the chard, grated Bitto cheese, and an egg ; season with salt and pepper. Peel the potatoes, dice them , and boil them in plenty of slightly salted water for 15 minutes or until tender. Drain and mash them into a puree ; add milk, salt, and pepper to taste.
Roll out the dough using a rolling pin or pasta machine to the thinnest setting. Place small mounds of filling on the sheet , cut the ravioli using a pastry wheel , and place them on a floured surface. Cook the ravioli in plenty of salted water. Drain them, place them in a pan with a little melted butter , and gently toss to glaze them. Serve the hot ravioli on a 'bed' of potato sauce.
You can also prepare the ravioli in advance, freezing them to have them ready to use. Place the ravioli on a surface (such as a cutting board) and freeze them without touching each other. Once frozen, you can store them in a container or bag in the freezer.
