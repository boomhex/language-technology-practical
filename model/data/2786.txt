Pane pasquale dolce is a super tasty Easter treat that really, really captures the essence of Italian holiday traditions. This pane pasquale dolce has a soft, kinda moist texture with sweetness from raisins, or "uva passa," mixed right in. As Easter comes, you'll see this on many Italian tables—especially in places where people really love keeping old customs alive. Adding condensed milk? That's a modern twist, making it even more tender and flavorful. And the hard-boiled eggs on top? They’re more than decoration. They symbolize new beginnings and spring's arrival, pretty much. Seriously good stuff.
During Pasqua, families often bring their pane pasquale dolce to chill picnics on Easter Monday, "pasquetta," you know? Sharing this dolce pasquale tradizionale at outdoor gatherings totally captures the spirit of togetherness. It's not just bread; it’s a way to keep Italian culture alive. Each slice offers a taste of how simple food can be both rich and meaningful. While some regions add their own twist, the core stays the same: a golden, rustic loaf that's as beautiful as it is satisfying. And you might also see other ricette tradizionali di Pasqua , like cute brioche bunnies, but this classic ricetta pane pasquale always brings everyone back to family moments and the seasonal spirit.
When you're looking for something that feels both traditional and kinda special, a slice of pane dolce di Pasqua is unbeatable. For real. Especially when it's fresh, a bit crispy on the outside, and just perfect for a holiday celebration. And here's the thing, can't go wrong with that.
To make the sweet Easter bread, sift the all-purpose flour and bread flour (alternatively, you can use flour 0) into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (if you don't have a stand mixer, you can knead by hand), add the dry yeast (or 12 g of fresh baker's yeast) , pour in the milk and water, and start the machine at medium speed, incorporating the condensed milk .
Also add the eggs, continuing to knead . Replace the paddle with the dough hook and continue kneading, adding the salt and butter in pieces a little at a time , waiting for each piece to be incorporated before adding another, continue kneading until the dough detaches from the sides, wrapping around the hook .
Form a ball with the dough, place it in a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap , and let it rise in a warm place (like an turned-off oven with the light on) until it has doubled in volume, it will take about a couple of hours. Meanwhile, soak the raisins in water . Take the risen dough ,
drain the softened raisins and incorporate them into the dough . Divide it into two equal dough balls ,
form each into a loaf about 27 inches long , then braid the two loaves and shape into a ring by joining the ends of the braid .
In a saucepan, cook 5 white eggs until they are hard-boiled. Once ready, let them cool, then place them between the braids so they are well fixed and equidistant. Brush the surface of the sweet with a beaten egg and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 40 minutes (or in a fan oven at 320°F for 30 minutes). Once cooked, remove the sweet Easter bread from the oven, let it cool slightly, and then serve it by cutting it into slices.
Store the Easter bread under a glass dome for 2-3 days.
The greediest can replace the raisins with chocolate chips! To give an aromatic note, you can soak the raisins in a liquor like Brandy.
