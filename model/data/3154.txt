instructions:
To prepare the naked cake with panettone, start with the cream: in a bowl, combine the eggs and powdered sugar , then mix the ingredients with an electric mixer. Then add the ricotta and mascarpone .
Keep mixing until you get a fluffy and homogeneous cream . In another bowl, pour the cream, add the stabilizer , and whip. Gently fold the whipped cream into the ricotta and mascarpone mixture by mixing from bottom to top to avoid deflating it.
Finally, add the chocolate chips and stir gently one last time. Place the cream in the fridge to chill for an hour. After this time, remove the dome of the panettone , then cut the rest into horizontal slices of the same thickness .
Fill the first slice with the cream , adding some blueberries and raspberries . Cover with the second slice and continue in this way until you reassemble the panettone.
Finally, cover the outside with the remaining cream and garnish the top with blueberries, raspberries, and a few mint leaves . Your naked cake with panettone is ready to be served !
The naked cake with panettone can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, covered with a cake dome.
If you wish, you can alternate the filling with a chocolate cream or dark chocolate ganache.
For an exotic variant, you can replace the berries with mango, pineapple, and kiwi!
