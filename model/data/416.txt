instructions:
To prepare the tart with custard cream, first make the custard. In a saucepan, pour the milk and add the peel of one lemon . Heat until almost boiling, on low heat, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, in another saucepan, place the egg yolks and the sugar .
Mix with a whisk until you get a smooth mixture . Then add the flour and mix again with the whisk . You should obtain a creamy and smooth consistency, free of lumps.
As soon as the milk is about to boil, remove the lemon peel and pour it into the egg mixture, stirring with the whisk . Put the pot back on the heat, on low, and continue to stir .
When the custard has thickened , transfer it to a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap, making sure it is in contact with the surface of the custard . Let it cool.
Now move on to prepare the shortcrust pastry: cut the cold butter from the fridge into pieces . Pour the flour into a mixer, add the butter and blend intermittently, to avoid the butter heating too much during the process, until you get a sandy consistency .
Add the eggs , powdered sugar , and grated lemon peel .
Blend for a few moments on low speed. Transfer everything onto a work surface and work quickly with your hands , just enough to compact and form a smooth dough. Flatten the dough, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes .
Butter and flour a 9.5-inch diameter mold. Take the pastry from the refrigerator and take two-thirds of the dough .
Roll out the pastry with a rolling pin to obtain a sheet about 0.4 inches thick . Place it on the mold , make it adhere to the edges, and remove the excess by passing with the rolling pin .
Prick the base with a fork and spread the custard, now cold, inside it . Roll out the remaining dough to a thickness of 0.4 inches, then cut strips 0.4 inches wide .
Lay the strips on the custard, first in one direction and then the other, to form diamonds , then remove the excess . Let the tart rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes .
Bake in a fan oven at 340°F for 25 minutes . Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool before dusting it with powdered sugar . Your tart with custard cream is ready to be served !
The tart with custard cream can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days. To enjoy it at its best, let it rest at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving.
To cool the custard faster, you can pour it into a bowl kept in the freezer.
You can flavor the custard with the aromas you like best: vanilla extract or bean, rum extract, cinnamon, etc.
When using the lemon peel, be careful to only take the yellow part, as the white is very bitter and would ruin the taste of the tart.
You can prepare the pastry even without a mixer or blender, the important thing is to work very quickly to prevent the heat from your hands from melting the butter.
