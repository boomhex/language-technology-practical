instructions:
The first step to prepare cinnamon jelly is to let the cinnamon sticks steep overnight in half a liter (about 2 cups) of water , so they release all their aroma into the liquid. The next day, boil them in the water and let them sit for the entire day, then strain the cinnamon and set the water aside.
Next, take care of the pistachios: to peel them, just blanch them for a few minutes in a small pot , then drain and place them on a piece of paper towel to dry the excess water. The skin will easily come off by applying gentle pressure with your fingers (5-6).
In a saucepan, combine the cornstarch and sugar , then add the strained water . Place the saucepan over the heat and stir until it thickens .
Once it reaches a viscous consistency , turn off the heat and pour the cinnamon jelly into bowls and allow it to cool. Serve the cinnamon jelly by sprinkling the surface with chopped pistachios .
