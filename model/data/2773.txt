instructions:
Crepe di farro con caponatina is one of those dishes that makes Sicilian food stand out for both flavor and wellness. Really good stuff. These farro crepes use a clever mix of whole spelt flour and low-refined 'farina 0'. So you get a high-fiber, moist wrap that's great for your gut and keeps you full. In Sicily, folks love their crepes crispy on the edges and warm enough to bring out all the taste in the filling.
The filling? It's a twist on the classic caponata recipe . It's loaded with artichokes—known for being depurative and diuretic—plus sultana raisins and pine nuts. Those raisins give the dish a little sweet hit, and the pine nuts add that tender bite with lots of vitamin E. Everything gets tossed in extra virgin olive oil —packed with healthy stuff like oleic acid and vitamins. Seriously good.
Many folks in Sicily and beyond love how these Italian crepes bring together a bunch of healthy ingredients and still taste really really good. The combo of eggplant, artichokes, raisins, and nuts makes these whole grain crepes feel super special—you don’t find this mix just anywhere. And look, since caponata is such a part of Mediterranean recipes, adding the artichokes and using spelt crepes makes this version unique.
Every bite? It's a mix of golden edges, soft veggies, and that light, tangy flavor from the vinegar in the caponata. These are the kinds of healthy crepe recipes everyone can enjoy—whether you’re into vegetarian Italian dishes or just want something different at your next meal. They usually disappear fast, so it’s smart to make a few extra. Trust me. Whether you’re sharing them at a family table or bringing them to a fundraiser, this dish gets people talking. And here's the thing: it’s a great reminder that traditional Italian dishes can be tasty and good for you.
To prepare the spelt crepes with caponata, start with the crepe batter: in a bowl, sift the type 0 flour and whole spelt flour . Also add the water at room temperature and mix everything with a whisk. Cover the mixture with plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
Meanwhile, prepare the caponata. In a bowl, pour cold water and half a lemon : this will be used to soak the artichokes to prevent them from turning black before use. Clean the artichokes (you can wear gloves to avoid staining your hands); check the Cooking School guide: How to clean artichokes . Cut off the pointiest part and remove the tough outer leaves until you reach the more tender ones. Then clean the stem by removing the fibrous part and cut them in half .
Remove the inner choke and cut them into thin slices , then put them in the bowl with the acidulated water .
In the meantime, soak the raisins in water , chop the fresh mint , and set aside. Desalt the capers and slice the pitted green olives. Then also peel the onion and cut it into thin slices , then finely chop it.
Then remove the fibrous outer part of the celery with a peeler and cut it into julienne strips . Blanch the celery briefly in boiling water to soften it .
Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of oil in a pan and sauté a peeled garlic clove (which will be removed at the end of cooking) and the chopped onion ; when the onion has softened, add the celery and the artichokes drained from the acidulated water . Let cook over high heat for 5 minutes.
Then add rice malt ; then deglaze with apple cider vinegar , and when it has evaporated, add the well-drained and squeezed raisins ,
the desalted capers , the chopped mint , the sliced pitted green olives, and the pine nuts . Season with salt and pepper to taste; let cook for about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, take the crepe batter; heat a crepe pan and lightly oil it (a non-stick pan about 9 inches in diameter will also do). When it's hot, pour a ladle of batter and spread it over the entire surface using a spatula or the back of a spoon. Cook for about a minute, and before flipping the crepe, sprinkle with white sesame seeds .
Cook the crepe on the other side as well, then repeat the same operation until the batter is finished. Now that the crepes and the filling are ready, you can fill them: distribute the vegetable caponata over half the surface and fold the crepes in half to serve them!
You can store the spelt crepes with caponata in the refrigerator in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap. You can store the raw crepe batter for up to 1 day in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container. Vegetables can be stored in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 1-2 days.
For this recipe, choose spring onions: they are sweeter and more pleasant than winter ones and will better enhance the artichoke's flavor!
