instructions:
To make the potato roll, first boil the potatoes in a pot full of cold water: calculate about 30 minutes from the moment it starts boiling (the time may vary depending on the size of the potatoes). Check the doneness of the potatoes by piercing them with a fork. Once cooked, drain them and peel while still hot .
Smash them with a fork , then add the eggs and salt to taste .
Add the grated cheese and season with nutmeg .
Carefully mix all the ingredients . Let the obtained mixture firm up for 2 hours in the refrigerator. Retrieve the dough from the fridge and spread it on a sheet of parchment paper, forming a rectangle about a quarter-inch thick, leveling it with a spatula . Fill the surface with the slices of cooked ham .
Also add the slices of provola . Roll from the shorter side, using the parchment paper to help, with gentle but firm movements .
Unwrap the parchment paper and brush the surface of the roll with oil , then wrap it back up tightly, sealing the ends like a candy . Bake at 356°F in a preheated static oven for about 30 minutes. Remove the roll from the oven and let it cool without unwrapping. Once lukewarm, let it cool completely for 20 minutes in the refrigerator. Unwrap the roll gently and let it brown in the oven under grill mode for about 10 minutes. Take out the roll and slice it with a serrated knife, only once lukewarm.
You can fill the potato roll with any cold cuts and cheese you prefer, like mortadella and fontina, or speck and smoked scamorza. Try it also with champignon mushrooms for a vegetarian version! For an extra greedy and crunchy touch, sprinkle the roll with plenty of breadcrumbs mixed with grated cheese before browning in the oven.
The potato roll can be stored for a maximum of 1 day in an airtight container in the fridge.
