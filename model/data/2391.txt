To prepare the fava and cheese parcels, first How to Clean Fava Beans and set them aside : you should obtain about 3 oz of shelled fava beans. Then cut the pecorino cheese into cubes of about 0.5 inches and set aside. Place the ricotta in the mixer glass along with the oil
The pine nuts and mint – setting aside 4 mint leaves – , the salt and pepper , activate the blades and blend to obtain a fairly homogeneous cream. Grate half the zest of half a lemon
And mix with a spatula . Cut 4 squares of parchment paper about 14x14 inches and place 2-3 tablespoons of ricotta cream in the center of each sheet which will form the base of the parcels. Distribute the cheese cubes on top of the ricotta
And the fava beans, trying to keep a rather orderly arrangement . Grate the remaining lemon zest in each parcel and garnish with a mint leaf .
Finally, sprinkle with pepper to taste : the parcels are ready to be closed . Form the parcels by bringing together the 4 corners of the parchment paper and
tie with string . Place the fava and cheese parcels on a baking sheet and bake them in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 15 minutes (if using a convection oven 320°F for about 5 minutes) . Once baked, plate them and let each guest unwrap their little bundle directly onto the plate .
The fava and cheese parcels, once cooked, can be stored closed in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 days; we recommend reheating them for at least 5 minutes in the oven before serving.
