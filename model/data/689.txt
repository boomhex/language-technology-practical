Moscardini in stew is, I gotta say, a true delight from Southern Italy. Down there, locals really savor their Italian seafood stew packed with these tender little octopuses and simple veggies. It's pretty much a classic. Thing is, this dish stands out because of its classic soffritto—chopped celery, carrots, and onions cooked until they're sweet and mellow. And you know what? The splash of Port wine—while not exactly typical in Italian recipes —adds this unique, almost sweet flavor. Really, it’s intriguing.
Down south, this dish pops up on family tables when everyone’s craving something that tastes like the sea—and has a little twist. Even with the Port, it keeps that Mediterranean vibe, with tomato sauce simmering away until each piece of octopus is super moist and just soaks up those flavors. Mopping up the sauce with crusty bread, or doing the “scarpetta”—which is awesome—is all part of the Italian experience. Many folks save any leftover sauce for spaghetti the next day. Smart, right?
While some regions might play around with the ingredients, in Southern Italy, it’s all about keeping it simple and letting the tender, juicy octopus shine. You get that blend of tangy tomato, sweet notes from the Port, and a hint of ocean brine from the seafood. Moscardini in guazzetto fits perfectly with other Mediterranean seafood dishes , but that Port wine makes it uniquely exciting. Whether you’re enjoying it hot from the pot or spooned over pasta, this dish is really a celebration of what makes seafood stew recipes from Italy so great—balancing tradition with a touch of surprise. It’s more than just a meal; it’s a taste of Southern Italian culture, bringing together flavors that are both comforting and fresh—perfect for a casual dinner that feels special.

To prepare octopuses in broth, first ensure your octopuses are already cleaned; rinse them under water and leave them in a colander. Peel the carrots and chop them finely . Peel the onion and chop it too , then peel the celery and chop it to the same size as the carrots and onions .
Cut a piece of chili pepper too , which will also be used for the soffritto. In a large pot, pour in the oil , add the soffritto and the chili pepper .
Let it infuse well, cooking over high heat. As soon as it starts to sizzle, add a pinch of salt. This way, the vegetables will release their liquid and the soffritto will not burn. After about 5 minutes, add the tomato paste and stir . Toast it for a couple of minutes, then add the octopuses .
Stir and cook them over high heat for a few minutes until they curl. When they are browned, remove the chili pepper and deglaze with the port and let the alcohol evaporate. Then add the peeled cherry tomatoes .
Cover with a lid and cook for 45-60 minutes, adding a bit of water, preferably warm, as needed. The octopuses should be very tender, and the sauce reduced to the right consistency . At this point, you can serve them .
Octopuses in broth can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days. Alternatively, you can freeze them.
Instead of peeled cherry tomatoes, you can use fresh tomatoes, tomato purée, or classic peeled tomatoes. Instead of Port, you can use a classic red or white wine.
