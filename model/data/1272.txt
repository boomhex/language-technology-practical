instructions:
To make the plum ring cake, first ensure all ingredients are at room temperature to work the batter better. Then wash the plums and cut them in half to remove the pit . Cut some into wedges .
Dice the rest of the plums . Now focus on the batter: in a bowl, add the softened butter, sugar , and grated lemon zest .
Beat with electric whisks for at least 5 minutes until the mixture is light and fluffy. Then add the eggs one at a time (make sure each egg is well incorporated before adding the next). Add the salt and slowly pour in the milk , alternating with the sifted flour .
Also incorporate the baking powder and mix gradually with the electric whisks until you achieve a smooth, lump-free batter. Now add the diced plums and stir to distribute them evenly.
Butter a 9-inch ring cake pan with a height of 3.5 inches and pour in the batter . Level it well and place the plum wedges on top . Sprinkle the surface with brown sugar .
The ring cake is ready for baking . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 50 minutes. Once done , let it cool, then turn it out onto a serving plate and garnish with powdered sugar as desired. The plum ring cake is ready to be enjoyed .
We recommend storing the plum ring cake in the fridge covered with a glass cloche for 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Try adding a pinch of ground ginger for a more aromatic version!
