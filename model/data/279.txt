Oh, let me tell you about cappellacci di zucca . It's this stuffed pasta that's, you know, super popular in Northern Italy. Seriously good stuff. Originating from Lombardy, especially around Mantua, it pairs sweet roasted pumpkin with crushed amaretti cookies—like a tasty surprise, really really delicious. The folks in Mantua have been making this kind of pumpkin ravioli for generations, turning autumn’s finest squash into something truly comforting and special.
The filling? It's all about the amaretti, giving it that gentle, tender texture with a hint of almond. So good. And toss these plump pasta pillows in a simple butter and thyme sauce. And look, you get a dish that absorbs all the seasoning, thanks to that rough, porous dough people in Northern Italy adore in their homemade pasta dishes .
On your plate, these butternut squash pasta shapes sit on a creamy smoked provola fondue —which is great—adding a rich, moist layer that just demands to be savored. The mix of sweet pumpkin, nutty cheese, and that tangy smoke from the provola makes this meal, well, a real treat. Perfect for when the weather cools down.
So here's the thing, this pasta isn’t just a quick meal. It's a labor of love, perfect for big family dinners or impressing guests with authentic traditional Italian recipes . In Lombardy, it’s a fall favorite. Pretty much. Variations in cheese or spices pop up from town to town, but the heart of the dish stays the same. People enjoy it as a main course with fresh sage or maybe a sprinkle of extra amaretti for that crunch.
If you’re curious about unique Italian stuffed pasta , this dish balances sweet and savory, creamy and golden, really capturing autumn in every bite. Whether you know this regional specialty or you're trying it for the first time, the harmony of flavors promises a memorable experience that transports you straight to the heart of Lombardy. For real.

To prepare the pumpkin and amaretti filled cappellacci on provola fondue, start with the egg pasta: On the work surface, pour the all-purpose flour and semolina , form a well and pour the eggs in the center . Begin to incorporate the flour into the eggs using a fork or scraper .
When the mixture starts to come together, continue to knead by hand until the dough becomes compact . Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest for about half an hour in a cool place .
In the meantime, prepare the filling: on a baking tray, pour a little oil , then form a pile with the sage leaves and garlic cloves . Place the pumpkin, halved and seeded, cut side down, enclosing the flavors in the cavity .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 45 minutes. When the pumpkin is soft, remove the skin and mash the flesh; for a smooth and creamy consistency, you can sieve it with a strainer . Add the grated cheese .
Also add the grated nutmeg , crushed amaretti , and stripped thyme .
Mix well, then transfer the filling into a piping bag and refrigerate for about twenty minutes . Meanwhile, prepare the fondue: melt the butter in a small saucepan, then add the flour . Mix well with a spatula, making sure the flour doesn't burn; it will take a couple of minutes .
When the flour is toasted, pour in the milk little by little and continue stirring over low heat . As soon as it starts to simmer, add the previously grated smoked provola .
Stir to completely melt the cheese, then turn off the heat and blend to get a smooth and stringy fondue . Retrieve the dough ball and lightly dust it with flour .
Roll out the dough with a pasta machine, starting from the widest roller setting and gradually reducing it, folding the sheets in between to reinforce them . Continue to roll out the dough until it reaches a thickness of about 0.04 inches (1 mm) .
Using a pastry cutter with a diameter of 7-8 cm, cut out discs , then squeeze a tuft of pumpkin and amaretti filling in the center of each one . Spray a little water on the edges to facilitate sealing .
Fold the discs into half moons , then turn the ends until they meet and pinch them together . After forming all the cappellacci, cook them in lightly boiling salted water for a few minutes .
In the meantime, prepare the dressing: melt the butter in a pan over low heat, when it turns a nice hazelnut color, add the thyme and a ladle of pasta cooking water . Gently swirl the pan to blend the dressing and make it creamy. Drain the cappellacci in the pan .
Let them quickly absorb the flavor by coating them with the dressing . You are ready to plate: distribute the fondue at the base of the plate, then add the cappellacci with the dressing and finish with some freshly crushed amaretti. Your pumpkin and amaretti filled cappellacci on provola fondue are ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the pumpkin and amaretti filled cappellacci on provola fondue immediately.
