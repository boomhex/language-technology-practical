instructions:
To prepare the chicken rolls in a pan, first cut the scamorza cheese into sticks about 0.4 inches thick . Place the chicken slice on a cutting board and lay a slice of ham on top .
Place two scamorza sticks in the center , roll it up , and secure with two toothpicks .
In a pan, pour the oil, add the unpeeled garlic , and sauté for a few minutes. Place the rolls in the pan and sear them on both sides over high heat for 3-4 minutes.
Deglaze with white wine and let the alcohol evaporate completely. Adjust salt and pepper .
Cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes over low heat. Remove the lid, increase the heat, and continue cooking for a few more minutes, just long enough for the sauce to dry . Your chicken rolls in a pan are ready to be served .
The chicken rolls can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days in a container with a lid. They can also be frozen in suitable containers.
You can replace the ham with speck and the scamorza with fontina or another stringy cheese of your choice. Additionally, if you prefer, you can coat the rolls in flour before searing them in the pan.
