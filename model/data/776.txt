To prepare the chicken poke, start by preparing the rice. Rinse it well until the water is clear . Pour it into a pot with 500 ml of water (equal weight) , turn on the heat, and cover with a lid . Cook for 2 minutes on high heat, then lower the heat and cook for another 10 minutes without ever removing the lid. This will result in the rice being slightly al dente; if you prefer it softer, cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the rice vinegar mixture. In a small pot, pour the vinegar and salt . Heat over medium-low heat until the salt is dissolved, then add the sugar . Stir and turn off the heat . Let it cool.
When the rice is ready, transfer it to a large container, preferably made of wood . If you use a wooden container, we recommend moistening it first with water so that the wood does not absorb the vinegar. Now add the vinegar mixture, pouring it over the wooden spatula to distribute it more gently and evenly over the rice. Stir the rice by moving it with the edge of the wooden spatula, to avoid crushing it . It is important to stir until the grains are shiny and well seasoned.
Stir occasionally until the rice is cold. Cover with a damp cloth so it doesn't stick, and set aside . Move on to the chicken, remove the cartilage. Cut the chicken breast into two parts to obtain two thick fillets .
In a bowl, beat the eggs with a little salt and pepper. First, dip the chicken breast in flour , then in the egg , and then in panko . Make a double coating by passing the chicken again in the eggs and then again in panko.
Transfer to a plate and prepare the second fillet in the same way. Heat plenty of seed oil until it reaches a temperature of 338°F. In the meantime, cut the peppers into strips , ensuring you have removed the seeds and internal filaments well. Also, cut the lime into slices .
Fry the chicken breast in hot oil (338°F) for about 10 minutes, lowering the heat once the chicken breast is immersed . This way, the chicken breast will cook well inside. After 10 minutes, it should be golden brown .
Use tongs to remove the chicken from the oil , place it on a tray with absorbent paper , and cut it into slices. Now you can assemble your chicken poke. Place the rice at the base, arrange the peppers, lime slices, radish sprouts, chopped cashews, and mixed sesame seeds on top. Dress with ponzu sauce, and the Chicken Poke is ready .
We recommend consuming the chicken poke immediately.
If you prefer, you can make shrimp poke in the same way, breading them like the chicken.
You can enrich the poke with sauces and vegetables of your choice.
