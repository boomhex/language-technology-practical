Crostatine con composta di mele really bring a bit of Italian bakery magic right to your table. I mean, these little tarts are all about that tender hazelnut shortcrust—pasta frolla, as it’s called in Italy. It's that melt-in-your-mouth bite. Super tasty and crispy. What really sets them apart? The creamy vanilla and butter filling just beneath a shiny apple compote. The apples are cooked down until they’re soft and sweet, but not too heavy—really letting you taste the fruit itself. It’s a dessert that feels special. Looks like a work of art with those mini puff pastry roses, and it’s made with a little extra care—like in a real Italian pasticceria. Plus, a dusting of powdered sugar and a fresh mint leaf on top gives these crostatine di mele fatte in casa a pop of color and freshness, making them really stand out on the dessert table. Especially nice for Mother’s Day.
Regional pastry fans know no two Italian bakeries make their ricetta crostatine di mele exactly the same. Like, really. Some spots up north might use more hazelnut in the crust, while southern versions could lean into a moist, golden finish or even sneak a hint of cinnamon into the apple layer. All these dolci tradizionali italiani share a focus on both the look and the taste. These aren’t just tarts; they’re meant to be shown off and shared. The way the apples caramelize just a bit as they bake? It brings a caramelized edge, almost like a tiny pie. Lighter though. And definitely more elegant. People love serving these crostatine con composta di mele at family gatherings or as a fancy treat when company’s over. It's the kind of dessert that feels like a present, for real—something you'd give to someone you care about, with each bite showing off a bit of Italian pastry tradition. Whether you’re into crostatine di mele e cannella or you like your tarts simple, these little treats bring out the best of autumn flavors and Italian baking. They really really showcase the art of Italian pastry making.
To prepare the mini tarts with apple compote, first make the hazelnut shortcrust pastry: place the all-purpose flour and powdered sugar in a mixer , then the cold butter cut into pieces and salt . Cut the vanilla pod in half and scrape the seeds with the tip of a knife and
add them directly into the mixer . Blend everything until you get a sandy mixture . Transfer the mixture onto a work surface, add the hazelnut flour , and mix to combine the two mixtures. If you can't find hazelnut flour, toast 100g of hazelnuts in the oven for a few minutes and once well cooled, finely chop them in a mixer.
Create a well in the center of the flour and add the whole egg plus the 2 yolks and start collecting the ingredients with your hands then knead until you obtain a smooth and compact dough . Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
After this time, take the shortcrust pastry and roll it out, with the help of a rolling pin, into a rather thin sheet, about 1/5 inch ; if the dough turns out sticky, sprinkle with a little flour. Line 5 non-stick round tart molds, 4 inches in diameter and 1.2 inches high ; if you don't have non-stick molds, remember to butter and flour them. Make the shortcrust pastry adhere well to the mold and then, with the rolling pin, remove the excess dough by pressing on the edges of the mold . Re-knead the scraps and roll them out again to line another mold.
Prick the bottom of the mini tarts with the tines of a fork and proceed with blind baking (for more details see our How to do blind baking ): place a sheet of baking paper inside the mini tarts and fill them with dried legumes so that the pastry does not swell during baking . Bake the mini tarts in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 15 minutes (if ventilated at 320°F for 10 minutes), then remove the beans and continue baking for another 5 minutes. Once baked, let your mini tarts cool .
Move on to preparing the buttercream (for the recipe sheet Buttercream ): place the sugar with the water in a thick-bottomed saucepan, let the sugar dissolve over low heat. When the sugar has dissolved, do not stir anymore and, using a food thermometer, measure that the syrup reaches 250°F . Meanwhile, place the yolks in a stand mixer, or work with the beaters of an electric mixer, and whisk them at medium speed to obtain a light and frothy mixture. Gradually add the sugar syrup and continue to whisk until the mixture is completely cooled.
While the whipped yolks are cooling, work the room-temperature butter with the seeds of the other half of the vanilla pod using a spatula until it becomes a cream, and then incorporate the butter into the whipped yolks . Continue to whisk to achieve a well-frothy and creamy mixture , which you will transfer into a piping bag and let rest in the refrigerator until ready to use .
Now prepare the apple compote: wash and peel the apple , remove the core, and cut it into small cubes . Cook the apple pieces in a non-stick pan over moderate heat with the butter for about 3 minutes.
Deglaze with the sparkling wine (or white wine) and filtered lemon juice ; cover with a lid and let the apple compote cook for about 20 minutes, until the apples are very tender .
Make the puff pastry and apple roses to serve as decoration: wash the apple and cut it in half, trim it to remove the core and seeds, then slice it very thinly, 1-2 mm, keeping the apple with the flat side down . In a saucepan, dissolve the sugar in the water , add the filtered lemon juice , and bring the liquid to a boil.
Add the apple slices and blanch them for 7-8 minutes ; once ready, drain them and let them cool. Lightly roll out the pre-made puff pastry with a rolling pin and cut out 10 strips about 0.4 inches wide and 4 inches long .
Place the slightly overlapping apple slices on the puff pastry strip and roll the strip to form a small rose . Proceed this way until you form 10 roses. Slightly open the petals of the roses and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , then bake them in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 30 minutes (if ventilated at 320°F for 25 minutes).
Once all the different preparations are ready, you can assemble your mini tarts with apple compote: remove the hazelnut shortcrust pastry shells from the mold and transfer them to a serving plate. Fill each mini tart first with the buttercream , leaving 0.2 inches from the edge , and then with the apple compote .
Dust the ready puff pastry roses with powdered sugar and decorate the mini tarts with them by placing them in the center . Finish with a mint leaf, and here are your mini tarts with apple compote ready .
You can store the filled mini tarts with apple compote in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, for about 2 days; freezing is not recommended. You can store the raw hazelnut shortcrust pastry in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, or freeze it and use it as needed; you can store the already baked shortcrust shells in a tin box or under a glass dome for 1-2 days. You can store the buttercream and apple compote in the refrigerator for 1 day covered with plastic wrap, so you can assemble the dessert the next day.
These mini tarts are the "nest" perfect for your creations, so get rid of the chatter and vary! Instead of buttercream, you can use custard, while instead of apple compote, try those with other fruits: in any case, the result is guaranteed!
