In Italy, fruit and cereal snack bars have totally become a hit with parents. They really love remembering those pre-packaged snacks from the '80s and '90s. But now, there's a big shift toward healthier options. And look, people want better ingredients with a touch of homemade care. These bars are a fantastic mix—really really good—of hearty oats, crunchy pistachios, and cranberries. Super tasty, honestly. The white chocolate coating? Adds some fun, making these granola bars not just nutritious but super enjoyable for kids, too.
You'll find them everywhere—in many Italian homes, on breakfast tables, tucked into backpacks, or ready for an after-school treat. The combo of flavors and textures gives a moist and slightly crispy bite. So so hard to resist. They easily outshine those old packaged snacks, for sure.
Thing is, what makes these healthy snack bars so appealing is how they fit with the modern Italian focus on food quality. People love the flexibility. You know, swap in local nuts or dried fruits depending on the season or your mood. Some regions even add hazelnuts or dried apricots. And you get unique variations—pretty cool, right? These bars offer a nice balanced energy boost. Perfect as low calorie snacks or even energy bars for active teenagers.
And they're not just for kids. Nope. Adults grab them for a quick breakfast or with coffee for a pick-me-up. Snacking is for everyone, and these bars prove it—bringing joy to all ages. With their golden hue from oats and a tender bite from the fruit, they look as good as they taste.
This recipe brings nostalgia for traditional snacks—but with a healthier twist. Fits perfectly in today’s Italian kitchens, showing how family-friendly snacks can also be really good for you. Which is great.
To prepare the cereal and fruit bars, start by coarsely chopping the pistachios . Then, place a saucepan with honey over low heat and when it reaches a boil, add the oats .
Add the chopped pistachios and dried cranberries . Stir and knead the mixture with a wooden spoon, over low heat, for 2-3 minutes.
Prepare a small bowl with sesame oil and a brush, and cut two sheets of parchment paper. Place one of the sheets on the baking tray, then brush it with sesame oil . Also, brush the other sheet on one side . Then pour the cereal and fruit mixture onto the baking tray lined with parchment paper .
And cover with the other sheet, keeping the oiled side in contact with the mixture . Flatten the mixture, first with your hands , then with a rolling pin , until it reaches a thickness of about 0.4 inches (approximately 1 cm).
With the help of a bench scraper, smooth the edges of the mixture , trying to give it a square or rectangular shape that will make cutting the bars easier. Bake in a preheated convection oven at 266°F (approximately 130°C), and cook for about 35 minutes . Remove from the oven and let it cool for 5 minutes, then transfer your block onto a cutting board and grease a knife with the remaining sesame oil .
With the knife, cut your bars to your preferred size . From a block of about 12x8 inches (approximately 30x20 cm), we obtained 15 bars. Once you have cut your bars, let them cool. Meanwhile, break the white chocolate into pieces and place it in a double boiler . Melt it, stirring often , ensuring it doesn't exceed the indicative temperature of 113°F (approximately 45°C).
Transfer the melted chocolate to a shallow and fairly wide dish, let it cool, and when it reaches a temperature of about 82°F (approximately 28°C), carefully dip one side of the now cooled bars . Transfer the bars to a silicone mat, with the dipped side facing down , and let them cool in a cool place or in the refrigerator if the room temperature is not sufficiently low. Once the chocolate has completely solidified, you can enjoy your fruit and cereal snack bars or wrap them in parchment paper for storage until use .
The cereal and fruit bars can be stored in a cool, dry place, wrapped individually in parchment paper and placed inside a well-sealed tin box, for up to 7 days.
