instructions:
To prepare the potato skewers, first wash the potatoes, pat them dry, and then cut them into slices 0.4 inches thick , removing the ends. Do the same with the scamorza cheese and bacon .
Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water for 10 minutes . In the meantime, sauté the bacon slices in a pan without adding any extra fat . Turn off the heat when they are well browned .
Transfer the bacon to a plate and in the same pan, sauté the potatoes, previously blanched and drained, for a few minutes on each side . Brown the potato slices and set aside. Everything is ready to assemble the skewers .
Take a wooden skewer stick, insert the ingredients alternating them: potatoes, bacon, scamorza cheese, and a sage leaf . You will have 4 skewers. Place the skewers on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, season with thyme leaves , and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 3-4 minutes. Serve the potato skewers hot with a drizzle of oil .
It is preferable to consume the skewers freshly made, but you can store them in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 1 day. We do not recommend freezing them.
If you use potatoes with thin skin, it won't be necessary to peel them; otherwise, you can peel them before slicing.
