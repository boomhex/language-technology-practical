To prepare pasta with celery, fennel, and Taggiasca olives, start by cleaning the celery. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the outer strings , then use a mandoline to slice it very thinly, about 0.08 inches. Take the spring onion, cut off the end, and remove the outer leaves .
Slice this finely as well and then move on to the fennel. Remove the base , cut it in half, and use a knife to also cut into the central part , which would be tougher when cooked.
Again using the mandoline, slice the fennel very thinly, about 0.08 inches , then cut the chili pepper into 3 parts (if you prefer, you can open it first and remove the seeds inside that add more heat) . Pour oil into a pan, add the spring onion, the chili pepper , and let it stew over moderate heat for 5 minutes. If necessary, you can add a ladle of water.
At this point, add both the celery and the fennel . Season with salt and pepper and let everything stew for about ten minutes, stirring often.
In the meantime, cook the pasta in plenty of boiling water, salted to taste , and in the meantime, slice the olives . Drain the pasta al dente directly into the sauce ,
add the Taggiasca olives and mix everything together . At this point, all that remains is to plate and serve your pasta with celery, fennel, and Taggiasca olives .
It is recommended to store pasta with celery, fennel, and Taggiasca olives in the refrigerator for a maximum of one day. Freezing is not recommended.
Add some toasted breadcrumbs or nuts: pine nuts or almonds will work great!
