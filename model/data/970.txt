instructions:
To prepare pumpkin and sausage lasagna, start with the sauce: peel and finely slice the onion , in a pan pour a drizzle of oil and add the onion, and sauté for a few minutes on low heat . Meanwhile, cut the sausage into pieces about 1.5 inches long .
Add the sausage pieces and brown them briefly. Then deglaze with white wine , and when the alcohol has evaporated, add the canned tomatoes
and the tomato paste . Stir everything well, salt, pepper, and cook on low heat for about twenty minutes with the lid on . Meanwhile, prepare the béchamel: in a small pot melt the butter over low heat, then turn off the heat and incorporate the flour, mixing with a whisk .

Then pour the hot milk , return to the heat, and thicken the sauce over medium heat, then salt and season with nutmeg. The béchamel should be quite fluid . Meanwhile, the sauce will be cooked, season with fresh chopped parsley
and set aside . Peel the pumpkin and cut it into very thin slices , so that they cook in the lasagna without pre-cooking.
Now assemble the lasagna: in a 12x8 inch rectangular baking dish spread a layer of béchamel , place a layer of pasta , then the sauce ,
the pumpkin, mozzarella cubes , and grated Grana Padano PDO cheese . Spread another layer of béchamel .
Make another layer with the pasta sheets, the béchamel , the pumpkin, and the sauce , continue until all the ingredients are used up.
Finish with a final layer of béchamel, pumpkin, sauce, mozzarella, and parmesan . Bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 40 minutes. Once cooked, remove the pumpkin and sausage lasagna from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving it at the table .
Lasagna can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of 2 days. Alternatively, if you have used all fresh ingredients, it can be frozen.
If you prefer, you can use Homemade pasta (sheets and shapes) following our fresh pasta recipe. In this case, the béchamel should be thicker, as fresh sheets absorb less liquid than dry pasta.
