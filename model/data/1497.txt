instructions:
To prepare Yorkshire pudding, take a non-stick muffin tin and pour the vegetable oil inside, distributing it evenly among the compartments . Place the tray in a static oven preheated to 392°F and heat the oil for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the eggs and milk in a bowl , add salt and pepper
and mix with a hand whisk , then also incorporate the flour and mix again until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous batter .
After 15 minutes, remove the tray from the oven, being very careful not to burn yourself with the boiling oil, and pour the batter into the compartments up to halfway up . The batter will start cooking, so immediately place the tray back in the oven and continue cooking for about 30 minutes, without ever opening the oven. Once baked, the puddings will be nicely puffed and then will tend to deflate to assume their characteristic irregular shape : let them cool slightly before removing and serving your Yorkshire pudding!
Yorkshire pudding can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 days. Alternatively, you can freeze the cooked puddings after letting them cool completely.
If you wish, you can enhance the batter by adding grated Parmesan cheese and chopped herbs.
Yorkshire pudding is a recipe dating back to at least the 1700s: originally it was called “dripping pudding” because the tray was placed under the meat spit to collect the juices dripping from it. With this trick, not only was food waste avoided, but the meal was also made more substantial in an era when meat was very expensive.
