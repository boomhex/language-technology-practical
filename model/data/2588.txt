instructions:
To prepare the tuna with a walnut and pistachio crust, place the shelled walnuts and pistachios in a food processor . Pulse until you obtain a fairly coarse chop , then spread the breading evenly on a tray .
In a separate dish, pour the soy sauce , then take the tuna fillet and dip it on both sides first in the soy sauce and then in the breading .
Make sure the chopped nuts adhere evenly to the entire surface of the fillet . Heat a non-stick pan well and then place the tuna in it and sear it over high heat for 2-3 minutes on each side , turning it with spatulas or kitchen tongs for even cooking ; do not extend the cooking time because the fillet should remain pink inside and not turn white, otherwise the meat will become dry.
When the tuna is ready, remove it from the pan , place it on a cutting board, and slice it into pieces about 3/4 inch thick . Arrange the slices on a serving dish (if desired, you can garnish with a drizzle of soy sauce) and finally serve your tuna fillet with a walnut and pistachio crust immediately .
It is recommended to consume the tuna with walnut and pistachio crust hot and fresh. If you have purchased fresh fish, you can freeze the breaded slices while raw and defrost them in the refrigerator before cooking.
For the breading, instead of pistachios and walnuts, you can use hazelnuts, pine nuts, or even white sesame seeds!
Before consuming raw, marinated, or not perfectly cooked fish, it is recommended to freeze it for at least 96 hours at 0°F in a home freezer labeled with 3 or more stars, according to the Ministry of Health's guidelines .
