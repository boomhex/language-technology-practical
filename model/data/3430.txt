So, here's the thing: Biscotti al gorgonzola aren't your typical cookies. Really, they're not. These are savory bites that get folks chatting, especially in Lombardy where they first showed up. It's all about the gorgonzola biscotti recipe —a tender pastry base mixed with rich Italian cheeses and a crunchy topping of walnuts and poppy seeds. You know, what really makes them stand out? It's the way the sharp, creamy gorgonzola blends with Parmigiano. Such a good mix of bold and savory flavors. Seriously good.
Up in Northern Italy, they're a big hit for aperitifs or anytime you need something a bit different at a buffet. Now and then, there's a twist with French Roquefort instead of gorgonzola. And you know what? That gives these savory biscotti with gorgonzola an extra tangy kick that's just as tasty—really, really tasty.
Thing is, swapping cheeses like that shows how Italian kitchens love to experiment. But the core of these gorgonzola and walnut biscotti stays the same—cheese, nuts, and a crisp, buttery base. Those poppy seeds on top? They add a nutty finish, which is great with a glass of wine or some sparkling drinks.
These snacks fit in anywhere—from a fancy dinner party to just hanging out with friends who like something moist and flavorful, yet not too heavy. For anyone into new gorgonzola appetizer recipes or looking for blue cheese biscotti with that genuine Italian vibe, these biscuits are a fantastic choice.
They blend traditional flavors with fresh ideas, showing how savory baking recipes from Lombardy can really surprise you. So, if you're aiming to add some fun to your next snack spread, these gorgonzola snack ideas? For real, they deserve a spot on the table. Whether you're all about Italian food or just love trying new tastes, these biscotti are sure to be a hit. No question.
To prepare the gorgonzola cookies, start by cutting the spicy gorgonzola into small cubes (you can also use Roquefort cheese), then place it in a bowl and add the grated Parmesan cheese . Finely chop the walnuts and set them aside .
Now proceed with the dough: place the sifted flour, softened butter at room temperature , baking powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl (or on a pastry board), then knead until you get a smooth dough . At this point, add the gorgonzola and grated Parmesan cheese and knead to mix the ingredients well.
Form a loaf with the dough, cover it with plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator for about half an hour . After the resting time, roll out the loaf with a rolling pin on a floured surface to form a sheet about 0.4 inches thick . Now, with the help of a round cutter about 1.2 inches in diameter, cut out the cookies and place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Brush the surface of the cookies with cream and cover them with chopped walnuts and sesame seeds. Finally, bake in a preheated oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes. Remove the shortbreads from the oven and let them cool on a rack.
Store the gorgonzola cookies in a tin box for 2-3 days. It is possible to freeze the raw dough and thaw it in the refrigerator when needed.
Not only gorgonzola, try the cookies also with the French cousin Roquefort, or if you prefer a less pronounced taste, prepare our Parmesan shortbread!
