From the lively bars of Amsterdam comes one snack that really gets people talking: bitterballen . These Dutch meatballs are a classic part of Dutch cuisine , especially when folks are out enjoying a drink with friends. What makes them different? Their tender and creamy inside. Really good stuff. It all starts with leftover boiled beef mixed into a rich sauce made from beef broth. The trick? Letting the meat soak overnight. And listen, this little step gives you a filling that’s not just easy to shape but also moist and packed with flavor. Once you’ve got the filling, each ball gets coated in breadcrumbs and fried until the outside is golden and crispy. Super tasty. These are the kind of snacks you see passed around at Dutch parties or lined up at the bar. And there's something about that crunchy bite and the silky inside that keeps people coming back for more.
As a bitterballen recipe , this is all about sharing a good time—and a little taste of the Netherlands. People usually enjoy these beef ragout balls hot and fresh, sometimes dunked in sharp mustard for that extra tangy kick. You know, in the Netherlands, folks love serving these beef croquettes as a kind of party food. Pretty much fits in with other traditional Dutch snacks . It’s about bringing people together, whether you’re hanging out at home or out in a busy pub. For real, the overnight marinade is the secret here. Every bite is soft and full of flavor, really setting these homemade croquettes apart from anything you’d buy in a store. Honestly, there’s a reason these are such a hit wherever they show up—between the crispy shell and the creamy inside, they’re just a really, really tasty way to enjoy beef. Anyone who tries them once usually wants to grab a second one, and they always disappear fast at any get-together. Can't go wrong. Whether it's a sunny afternoon or a cozy evening, these snacks are perfect for sharing and enjoying with friends.
To make the boiled meat croquettes (bitterballen), start by preparing the boiled meat: place the beef in 1.5 liters of water , add salt , and let it cook over medium heat until the meat has softened; this will take at least 1 hour. Occasionally, skim the impurities that form on the surface with a skimmer. When the meat is cooked, drain and let it cool , while keeping the broth aside.
While the meat is cooking, prepare the sauce: chop the bunch of parsley , peel and finely chop the onion , and place the butter in a large pan .
Let it melt over low heat, then slowly add the flour while stirring with a whisk . You need to create a roux and give the flour and butter mixture a golden color, being careful not to burn it. Once the roux is ready, pour in the beef broth and continue stirring; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook over low heat for a few minutes, then add the onion .
and the chopped parsley . Cook for a few more minutes to thicken it; then shred the meat with your hands into small pieces and add it to the béchamel .
Mix and turn off the heat. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, grate the nutmeg , and cover it with plastic wrap : it should rest in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours, or better yet, overnight.
After the necessary time, take the mixture and shape it by taking about a tablespoon at a time to create 30 spherical meatballs. Roll them in flour , beaten eggs .
and breadcrumbs . As you make them, place them on a tray lined with parchment paper and put them in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap to firm up for at least 30 minutes; then fry a few at a time in hot oil (you can use peanut oil), heated to a temperature of 375°F and maintain it, checking with a food thermometer .
When they are nicely golden, drain them and place them on a tray lined with paper towels to drain . Your boiled meat croquettes are ready to be enjoyed hot !
You can store the raw mixture in the refrigerator for 2 days covered with plastic wrap. Once fried, they can be kept in the refrigerator for 1-2 days and reheated as needed. Freezing the croquettes is not recommended to preserve their soft, melty consistency.
Boiled meat croquettes can also be made with veal or chicken!
