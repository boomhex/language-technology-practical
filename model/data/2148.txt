instructions:
Hailing from Naples, the sartù di riso is like a culinary legend, really. People in Campania talk about it like it's a story passed down through generations. And look, it’s not just any baked rice dish —this one’s got history! French influences blend with local pride to make something truly special. In Campania, it's more than a typical rice casserole; it’s packed with tender meatballs, slices of sausage, green peas, and chunks of moist hard-boiled egg.
All of this goodness is wrapped in rice soaking up a real-deal Neapolitan ragù. Each bite is a mix of tangy tomato and savory sauce. Seriously good. Folks in Naples say it's not just food—it’s history on a plate, showing how aristocratic style mixed with southern comfort.
Some see rice dishes as basic, but the Neapolitan rice mold ? It’s anything but! With layers of flavor and tradition baked right in. Across Campania, you’ll find little twists in the classic Italian rice timbale . Some places add extra cheese for a creamy touch, while others aim for a crispy, golden crust. Every slice is perfect—soft and crunchy.
What makes the sartù recipe so unique is how it combines Italian comfort with a sense of occasion—perfect for big Sunday lunches or holiday feasts. In Naples, there’s a real respect for how the rice molds to the shape of the pan, keeping all the good stuff tucked inside. People say it’s almost like a rice pie, but way more rich and satisfying. And the sauce? So so good.
No random leftovers here—every part, from the slow-cooked ragù to those tiny meatballs, is crafted with care. It’s easy to see why the sartù di riso remains a Naples specialty, loved by anyone lucky enough to try it. The blend of old-school techniques and big flavors makes it a memorable dish long after the meal is done. For sure.
To prepare the rice sartù, start with the preparation of the classic Neapolitan ragù. In a very large pot, sauté a chopped onion over low heat, then let all the pieces of meat sear for a few minutes, browning on all sides . Deglaze with wine , wait for the alcohol to evaporate completely before pouring in the tomato puree, the water , and a pinch of salt.
Let it cook on low heat: the ragù should simmer for at least 4 hours , adding more water as needed. At the end of cooking, make sure the ragù is properly salted and set aside the pieces of meat (you can serve them as a second course) . You will need the sausages for later in the preparation.
To prepare the meatballs, start by soaking the bread crumbs in cold water for about ten minutes, then drain and squeeze them with a fork or with your hands to remove all the excess water. In a bowl, add the ground meat
along with the lightly beaten egg, the Parmesan cheese, and the well-squeezed bread crumbs , season with salt and pepper, and add some chopped parsley, kneading to obtain a homogeneous mixture . At this point, you can form the meatballs: take about 4 grams of mixture and mold it between your hands to form small spheres . By doing so, you will get 100 meatballs.
Heat some oil in a pan: you don't need to deep-fry, so don't pour too much. Start placing the meatballs in the pan a few at a time , cooking for about 3 minutes and turning them halfway through . Once ready, drain them on absorbent paper and continue with the others .
Finally, proceed with the last phase to prepare the rice sartù. First, prepare the Hard Boiled Eggs . Place the eggs in cold water and set the pot on the heat, counting 9 minutes from the moment it starts to boil. Then drain, rinse under cool water for a moment, and start peeling them . Finally, slice them thinly with a knife or using an egg slicer.
Return to the Neapolitan ragù by placing the pot back on the flame, add 200 grams of water , and cook the rice . Then adjust the salt and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking at the bottom. The rice should completely absorb the ragù .
When it's cooked, transfer it to a bowl and let it cool for about ten minutes . Meanwhile, you can beat the eggs in a bowl with salt, pepper, and grated cheese . Mix everything well and pour over the now-cooled rice and continue to mix to incorporate all the ingredients.
Now butter a mold 8 inches in diameter and about 5 inches in height; then sprinkle with breadcrumbs and proceed to pour some of the mixture , making sure to distribute it all around, pressing with the back of a spoon as you go, to create a shell about half an inch thick . Make sure to keep some rice aside to close the timbale.
At this point, you can proceed to stuff your timballo, but first cut the sausages you set aside into slices and cube the mozzarella . At the center of the sartù, place a first layer of eggs and mozzarella
then peas (just leave them at room temperature while you prepare the rest) and meatballs , sausages , and continue adding layers of mozzarella, peas, and meatballs .
Finally, cover the last layer with sliced eggs and the remaining rice kept aside , which you will level with the spoon to compact the surface well .
Sprinkle with breadcrumbs and add a few pats of butter , finally bake your timbale in a preheated static oven at 180°C (356°F) for 60 minutes (convection baking is not recommended as it might dry out the mixture too much) . Let it cool for about ten minutes before unmolding your rice sartù and enjoy it while still warm .
You can prepare the Neapolitan ragù in advance, even the day before if you prefer, and then prepare the rice sartù. If you want to store the timbale, you can cover it with plastic wrap and keep it in the fridge for a maximum of 1-2 days. Lastly, you can also freeze the sartù if you have used fresh and not defrosted ingredients.
Keep some Neapolitan ragù aside so you can accompany the rice sartù with a generous spoonful of tomato sauce! Try also the white version, cooking the rice in water or broth and preparing the rest as per the recipe. Some also add chicken livers sautéed in a pan with peas, try it yourself!
