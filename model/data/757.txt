instructions:
To prepare the rigatoni with spinach, sausage, and robiola, first peel and finely chop the onion . Coarsely chop the well-washed spinach as well . Now transfer the robiola to a bowl, work it with a fork to soften it and store it in the refrigerator.
Move on to the sausage: remove it from the casing and crumble it with your hands . Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan , add the onion and let it brown.
Add the crumbled sausage and stir until well browned. Lastly, add the spinach and season with a pinch of salt .
Once the spinach has wilted, add the robiola and the milk , which will help melt the cheese. Add it little by little until you get the right creaminess. Meanwhile, cook the pasta in plenty of boiling salted water .
Drain the pasta al dente, transfer it to the pan with the sauce , and sauté it for a few moments . The rigatoni with spinach, sausage, and robiola are ready to serve !
We recommend consuming the rigatoni with spinach, sausage, and robiola immediately; alternatively, they can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
