instructions:
To prepare the biscuit dough, pour the eggs and vanilla extract into the bowl of a stand mixer equipped with whisks . Turn on the machine and slowly add the sugar. Work for about 10 minutes until you get a swollen, light, and frothy mixture .
Add the flour by sifting it directly into the bowl and gently mix with a spatula from bottom to top to incorporate it, without rushing and with light movements . Butter and line a 12x16 inches baking tray with parchment paper. Then pour the batter into the tray .
Level the surface with a small spatula and bake in a preheated static oven at 428°F for about 8-10 minutes: the surface should be golden . You can do the toothpick test before removing from the oven; remember that every oven is different, so yours may require more time or a slightly lower temperature. In the meantime, prepare a sheet of parchment paper and place it on the counter. As soon as you take the biscuit dough out of the oven, you will need to flip it onto the clean sheet of parchment paper .
Let it cool slightly before gently removing the sheet of parchment paper that was at the bottom of the tray . Then place it back over the biscuit dough and leave it like this until it cools completely . At that point, you can use the biscuit dough to fill and roll as you prefer !
Biscuit dough can be stored, wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 1 day. However, we recommend preparing and filling it as soon as it cools.
It can be frozen once completely cooled.
Biscuit dough can be cut and used like sponge cake with pastry rings, as if it were a layer of sponge cake, for a layered cake.
If you want to make cocoa biscuit dough, you can follow the recipe using 1/4 cup of flour and 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder. If you are concerned that the egg flavor might be too strong, flavor the batter with citrus zest, like lemon, for example, or add some ground cinnamon.
For a greater aroma and golden color, you can add a tablespoon of honey to the batter.
