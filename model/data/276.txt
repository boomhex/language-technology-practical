Dive into the flavors of Liguria with this pan-seared branzino paired perfectly with sautéed zucchini . Seriously good stuff. Imagine the crunchy skin of the sea bass, fresh off the pan, nestled next to zucchini slices that are just the right amount of tender. Ligurians love their fresh herbs and real ingredients—so your fish gets just a touch of salt, pepper and maybe a hint of oregano or parsley. And here's the thing: the real showstopper is the salsa salmoriglio .
It's a blend of lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, garlic, and a dash of vinegar. This sauce is bright and fragrant, bringing a burst of flavor that feels light yet satisfying.

The zucchini turns slightly sweet as it sautés, and the fresh mint and garlic make every bite pop.

Whether you go all out with the full Ligurian sauce or keep it simple with just herbs and oil, this meal transports you straight to the coast of Liguria.

Start by cleaning the sea bass: first, remove the scales by scraping the skin with the appropriate tool or the back of a knife, working from the tail to the head . Then, with scissors, remove the lateral and dorsal fins , then cut open the abdomen to remove the innards.
Remove the head and open the fish like a book by running a knife along the central bone, then gently detach the dorsal spine and main bones .
Trim the fillet by removing the thinnest and fattiest part of the belly to obtain an even surface. At this point, season the opened sea bass with a drizzle of oil and salt. Set it aside while you prepare the sauce. Chop the parsley .
Peel and chop the garlic clove . In a measuring cup, pour the extra virgin olive oil, white wine vinegar , and lemon juice .
Add the chopped garlic , finely chopped parsley , and dried oregano .
Add the salt and blend everything with an immersion blender until you get a creamy and homogeneous green sauce .
Then move on to the zucchini: cut them into thin slices and heat a pan with oil and a garlic clove. When the garlic is golden, add the zucchini and sauté over high heat for 5-7 minutes to brown them well. Season with freshly ground salt and pepper .
Finish with chopped mint leaves off the heat . Now heat a pan with a drizzle of oil and place the sea bass skin-side down . Press gently with a spatula to adhere the skin well. Cook for 8-10 minutes, depending on the size of the fish.
Let it cook until you achieve a crispy golden crust, then flip the sea bass, turn off the heat, and let it cook for another 5 minutes to ensure a gentle cooking. Arrange the plate: place the sautéed zucchini on the bottom of the serving dish and place the well-browned sea bass on top .
Generously brush the surface of the fish with the sauce , covering it evenly , and garnish with thyme leaves. The pan-seared sea bass with sautéed zucchini is ready to be served .
We recommend consuming the sea bass with its sauce right away.
You can store the sautéed zucchini and herb sauce in the fridge for a couple of days.


If you want a milder sauce, substitute the white wine vinegar with apple cider vinegar or a tablespoon of water: you'll get a lighter yet still aromatic salmoriglio.
