instructions:
To prepare the mimosa tart, start with the shortcrust pastry: in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the diced butter, taken out of the fridge 5 minutes earlier, sugar , and a pinch of salt . Turn on the mixer to combine quickly .
Add the egg yolks and lemon zest , mix well, then incorporate the flour and continue to knead.
You should obtain a compact and uniform dough . Form a dough ball , wrap it in plastic wrap , and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours.
To prepare the custard, extract the seeds from the vanilla bean, then bring the milk to a boil with the lemon zest, the vanilla bean, a pinch of ground cinnamon, and a pinch of salt . Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the vanilla seeds , egg yolks, and sugar .
Mix with a whisk , then incorporate the corn starch and rice starch and blend everything well .
When the milk reaches boiling, strain it directly into the bowl with the egg yolk and sugar mixture and whisk to temper it . Transfer the mixture to a double-bottomed saucepan .
Cook the cream over medium heat, stirring constantly , until it has thickened . Pour the cream into a baking dish , cover with cling film in contact with the surface, and let it cool to room temperature for 30 minutes. Then transfer it to a piping bag without a nozzle and refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
To prepare the sponge cake, in the stand mixer with electric whisks, add the sugar, egg yolks , whole eggs , and a pinch of salt. Whisk for at least 10 minutes .
You should obtain a light and fluffy mixture . In a separate bowl, sift the flour and the potato starch a couple of times , then gradually incorporate the powders into the whipped mixture, stirring gently with a spatula from bottom to top to prevent it from deflating .
The batter is ready . Line a 10-inch diameter baking pan with parchment paper and pour the batter inside . Bake in a static oven preheated to 347-356°F for about 18 minutes. Do the toothpick test: if it comes out dry, the sponge cake is ready. Remove it from the oven and let it cool to room temperature.
To prepare the syrup, pour the water and sugar into a saucepan , then bring to a boil . Remove from heat and let cool completely. Once the syrup is cold, add the rum and stir.
After the shortcrust pastry has rested in the refrigerator, roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured work surface to a thickness of about 1/4 inch . Butter and flour a 10-inch diameter pan, at least 1.5 inches high, and line it with the shortcrust pastry, first wrapping it around the rolling pin and then unrolling it onto the pan .
Press the pastry onto the bottom and sides, then trim the excess dough and prick the bottom with a fork . Bake in a static oven preheated to 347°F for about 30 minutes . Once baked, let the base cool completely .
Clean the pineapple and cut out 7 oz of pulp , then dice into small cubes . In a pan, melt the butter and brown sugar .
Add the pineapple , deglaze with the rum , and cook over low heat until slightly caramelized .
Drain the pineapple cubes and let them cool completely . Meanwhile, using a serrated knife, remove the outer crust of the sponge cake . Cut the sponge cake horizontally in half to obtain a 3/8 inch thick disc .
You will obtain 2 discs . Cut one disc into approximately 3/8 inch cubes , creating mimosa flowers .
Place the cooled shortcrust base on a serving platter , then spread half of the custard on the bottom using a spatula .
You should have an even layer . Brush one side of the second 3/8 inch thick sponge cake disc with syrup, then place it on top of the cream, with the moistened side facing down , then brush it with rum syrup on the other side as well .
Spread the remaining custard , then add the caramelized pineapple cubes and level everything with the back of a spoon .
Sprinkle the surface with the sponge cake cubes . Crumble the leftover cubes by passing them through a sieve and distribute the crumbs over the cake .
Finish with powdered sugar and a fresh strawberry halved . Let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving your mimosa tart !
The mimosa tart can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
You can get ahead with the preparations by making the shortcrust pastry, cream, and sponge cake the day before.
For a non-alcoholic version, you can replace the rum with orange juice. Alternatively, you can use Grand Marnier for a citrus touch, Marsala for a sweet enveloping flavor, or Amaretto for an almond note.
