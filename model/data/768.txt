instructions:
To make sweet and sour pork, first cut the meat into cubes of about 1.5 cm (approximately 1 inch) . Rinse it under running water and transfer it to a bowl, then season with salt and pepper.
Add the rice wine and half a beaten egg , mix well, and let marinate while you continue with the recipe .
Proceed with the preparation of the batter: in a bowl combine the flour with the cornstarch and the yeast , then gradually pour in the water while mixing with chopsticks .
Continue mixing until you achieve a smooth consistency , then let it rest for 10 minutes. In the meantime, clean and cut the green bell pepper and the tomato into cubes of the same size.
Do the same with the slices of canned pineapple . After the resting time, pour the batter into the bowl with the marinated meat and mix well to coat the cubes evenly .
Heat the wok for about a minute before adding the vegetable oil to bring it to a temperature of 350°F. Fry the battered meat cubes for about 5-7 minutes, gently moving them to prevent sticking . Once golden , drain and transfer to paper towels .
Now prepare the sweet and sour sauce: bring the water to a boil in a wok or saucepan, then add the sugar , tomato paste , and vinegar . Stir and return to a boil.
Meanwhile, pour the cornstarch and water into a separate bowl , mix well, and gradually pour the mixture into the sauce . Continue stirring with a whisk for a few minutes .
Return to the wok where you cooked the pork, washed and dried, and heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the bell pepper and tomato and stir-fry for a minute, then add the pineapple .
Pour in the sweet and sour sauce and mix well , then add the fried meat cubes .
Stir-fry everything for about 30 seconds , and finally, season with a tablespoon of vegetable oil . Your sweet and sour pork is ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the sweet and sour pork as soon as it's ready to prevent the fried coating from losing its crispiness.
The sweet and sour sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days, in an airtight glass jar.
For a lighter version, you can replace the pork with chicken and stir-fry it separately with a drizzle of vegetable oil before adding it to the rest of the ingredients. Also, check out our Chicken in Sweet and Sour Sauce recipe!
