To prepare the pasta ring bake, start with the tomato sauce; heat a non-stick pot with a drizzle of oil and the garlic clove . Let it brown briefly, then pour in the tomato puree along with the basil leaves ; add salt to taste and cook over very low heat for 30 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the meatballs: in a bowl, place the ground meat, sweet paprika , and season with salt and pepper (5-6).
Add the grated nutmeg , thyme leaves , the whole egg, and 50 g (1.76 oz) of grated Parmesan .
Mix vigorously with your hands until everything is well combined . Make small balls weighing 5 g (0.18 oz) each and continue until the mixture is finished: with our doses, you should obtain 80 meatballs .
Heat a large pan with oil for frying and check that the temperature reaches 350°F-355°F with a kitchen thermometer. Fry the meatballs a few at a time , then, when they are nicely golden, drain them with a slotted spoon and place them on a sheet of absorbent paper . When the sauce is ready, turn off the heat and remove the garlic. Bring salted water to a boil in a large pot and cook the fusilli for 7-8 minutes .
Drain the pasta, then pour it directly into the sauce ; mix with a kitchen spatula, then add 100 g (3.5 oz) of grated cheese , keeping a small amount aside for later. Cut the Asiago into cubes
and add it to the pasta, mixing everything together (19-20). Add some meatballs to the pasta
and mix . Now you can proceed with assembling the ring: place the remaining meatballs in a greased 10-inch ring mold, arranging them evenly next to each other . Then distribute the fusilli with the sauce up to the edge of the mold,
then finish with a sprinkle of the grated cheese you set aside . Place under the grill at 465°F for 8-10 minutes: when it is nicely golden , turn off the heat and unmold onto a serving plate: your pasta ring bake is ready to be served hot .
It is recommended to consume the pasta ring bake immediately after preparation. You can store it for up to 2 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container. Alternatively, you can freeze it only if fresh, non-defrosted products have been used.
A small but useful tip: remember to unmold the ring immediately, otherwise it risks sticking to the mold. Also, instead of Asiago, you can use any cheese you prefer!
