To prepare the chicken with 4 flavors, start with the preparation of the chicken: separate the drumsticks from the thighs, remove the femur from the thighs, and tie them with kitchen string as if they were roulades (alternatively, you can use 8 drumsticks). Wash the onion, celery, leek, and carrot and cut them into julienne strips, then place them in a large pan with the melted butter and let them brown well. Then place the 4 drumsticks and 4 thighs in the pan,
brown them on both sides and drizzle everything with the beer, then salt and pepper. Once the beer has evaporated, remove from the heat and continue cooking in the oven at 320°F for one hour. Then prepare the carrot flan: peel the carrots and steam them, then blend and strain to remove excess liquid . In a saucepan, bring the milk to a boil with the star anise and in another saucepan melt the butter and add the flour. Incorporate the milk you have strained into this mixture, stirring constantly with a whisk: you will thus obtain a fairly thick béchamel sauce that you will salt Béchamel sauce .
Mix the carrot puree with the béchamel sauce , then also incorporate the whole eggs and the two yolks and blend everything. Butter and flour 4 molds , pour the mixture into them and bake in the oven at 320°F for 60 minutes. Finally, serve the dish by placing the chicken on a bed of vegetables, sprinkle with the cooking juices, and serve accompanied by the carrot flan.
