instructions:
To prepare the gluten-free mimosa cake, pour the eggs, sugar, and vanilla bean seeds into the stand mixer bowl. Set aside the empty pod for later. Turn on the machine and whisk the ingredients for about 10 minutes until you get a foamy mixture . At this point, sift the cornstarch inside.
and gently incorporate it into the mixture, stirring from bottom to top with a whisk . Butter and line the bottom of two 7-inch cake pans with parchment paper. Pour the batter evenly into the two pans . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 25 minutes. Always do the toothpick test, then remove the two sponge cakes from the oven ,
and invert them while still hot onto a wire rack . Gently remove the parchment paper and let them cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Meanwhile, make the custard. Pour the milk into a saucepan and add the previously emptied vanilla pod . Heat on the stove until it boils.
Meanwhile, pour the egg yolks and sugar into another saucepan, mix well with a whisk until you get a smooth mixture. Add the cornstarch
and mix again until well combined . When the milk reaches boiling, pour a little over the egg mixture and stir . Add the remaining hot milk and stir again. Return the saucepan to the stove and, while stirring, cook over low heat
until the cream thickens , which will take just a few minutes. Transfer the custard to a bowl, cover with cling film , and let it cool first at room temperature, then in the fridge for an hour . Now make the syrup. Pour sugar and water into a saucepan .
Add the lemon zest and bring to a boil on the stove. Let simmer over low heat for 3 minutes. Then remove from heat and let cool at room temperature. When the cream is well chilled, whip 1 1/4 cups of fresh cream using an electric mixer .
Take 3/4 cup of whipped cream and add it to the cream . Store the rest in the fridge. Mix gently with a hand whisk until you obtain a homogeneous cream .
Transfer it to a piping bag . Take one of the sponge cakes and cut it in half using a long serrated knife . Dip a pastry brush into the syrup and use it to soak the base of the sponge cake .
Fill with the gluten-free diplomat cream, placing more in the center to form a dome . Place the other half of the sponge cake on the cream, with the cut side facing you, and press gently on the sides with your fingers to shape the dome . Soak the top of the cake with the syrup .
Take the second sponge cake and, using a long serrated knife, trim it completely to remove the dark parts . Then cut 1/2 inch thick slices . From these, cut 1/2 inch wide strips and finally 1/2 inch cubes .
Take the reserved whipped cream and use it to coat the entire cake, using a spatula . Then cover with the sponge cake cubes, pressing them well into the cream , and decorate with fresh edible flowers .
The gluten-free mimosa cake can be stored in the fridge for 3 days.
If you can't find edible flowers, decorate the cake with fresh berries!
