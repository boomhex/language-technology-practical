It’s perfect for a cozy dinner—homey yet special. Dive in, and enjoy Italy’s flavors like never before.
To prepare burnt wheat orecchiette, start with the preparation of the orecchiette: if you want to get ahead, you can also prepare them the day before. In a large bowl, combine the remilled semolina and burnt wheat flour , add the extra virgin olive oil in a thin stream , and the salt .
Also pour in the cold water and start kneading . Transfer the dough onto a work surface and continue to work it until it is very smooth and rather firm .
Shape the dough into a ball and wrap it with plastic wrap . Let it rest for about 30 minutes, then, taking a small portion of dough at a time , form pasta tubes that are not too thin .
Now cut the pasta tubes into pieces about 0.39 inches . With a knife with a rounded tip, drag each piece of pasta on the work surface so that the pasta curves, taking on the shape of a shell . During this operation, keep one side of the piece of pasta stationary with the other hand . At this point, place each shell on the tip of your thumb and flip it backward to obtain your orecchiette. Continue this way until the dough is finished. Your orecchiette are ready: place them on a floured work surface and let them dry until ready to use.
Move on to cleaning the whitefish. You can buy them already gutted from your fishmonger, so you will only need to scale them by running the sharp blade of a knife from tail to head. Perform this operation under running water to avoid spreading the scales . Now cut into the tail and the dorsal part of the fish along the spine , starting from the top, and proceed by moving the blade horizontally concerning the work surface .
After obtaining the first fillet , repeat the operation on the other side to get the second, and continue this way with all the whitefish. In a large non-stick pan, heat a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and sear the fillets first on the flesh side . Then turn them over to sear them on the skin side as well . Remove the fillets from the pan and set them aside.
Proceed with cleaning the asparagus. After washing them thoroughly, remove the more woody white ends . With a vegetable peeler or gently with a small knife proceeding vertically from top to bottom, peel the stem, removing the more fibrous outer part . Now cut the asparagus into pieces about 0.39 inches, leaving the tips a bit longer .
Now take the same pan you used to sear the whitefish fillets, and pour in a drizzle of oil . Add the asparagus and sauté them over moderate heat for about 7 minutes: they should be only slightly softened. At this point, add the cherry tomatoes cut in half .
Season with pepper and salt and deglaze with white wine . Meanwhile, as the wine evaporates, remove the skin from the whitefish fillets you had set aside .
Cut the fish into not too small pieces and add them to the pan. Now cook the orecchiette in plenty of salted water for about 12-15 minutes. The cooking time of homemade pasta can vary greatly, so taste to check for the desired degree of doneness.
Drain your orecchiette and add them to the pan . Sauté the pasta in the dressing for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to blend better . The burnt wheat orecchiette with whitefish and asparagus are ready to be enjoyed !
If dried on a floured surface and then sealed in a tightly closed bag, burnt wheat orecchiette can be stored for 2 weeks. The dressing should be prepared and consumed immediately but can also be frozen well-sealed in a suitable container if fresh, non-defrosted ingredients have been used.
Whitefish is a small fish, thus presenting a bit more difficulty in cleaning compared to larger fish like sea bream or salmon. It would be preferable to have them filleted by your trusted fishmonger.
