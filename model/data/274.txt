instructions:
To prepare the braised fennel on cannellini bean cream, first wash the fennel and remove the ends, keeping the fennel fronds for decoration . Cut the fennel into wedges and set aside. Squeeze the juice from the oranges .
Pour the strained juice into a saucepan and reduce it over high heat until you get a thick sauce ; it will take about 5 minutes.
In a jug, place the drained and rinsed cannellini beans, then season with salt , pepper, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil , add 100 ml of water and blend with an immersion blender .
You should obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream . Heat a dash of oil in a pan, place the fennel here and brown them on both sides over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes .
The fennel should be well browned . Everything is ready to compose the dish: spread the bean cream on the bottom , then place the fennel on top .
Garnish with the reserved fennel fronds , drizzle with the orange sauce reduction , and serve your braised fennel on cannellini bean cream immediately !
It is advisable to consume the braised fennel on cannellini bean cream immediately.
You can store the cannellini bean cream and the braised fennel separately in the refrigerator for a couple of days, without the orange juice reduction.
If you prefer a more pronounced contrast of flavors, you can replace the orange sauce with a reduced balsamic vinegar sauce: its sweet and sour taste pairs perfectly with the braised fennel.
