Pasta with pumpkin and amaretti is, well, a fantastic pumpkin pasta recipe . Really good stuff. It's Northern Italian comfort food at its best. In Lombardy, especially around Mantua, folks love this dish for its mix of sweet and savory flavors. And the sauce? It starts with soft Delica pumpkin—cooks down until it’s velvety and rich—and then it is tossed with short pasta like mezze maniche or rigatoni.
And here's the thing: What really sets it apart from other Italian pumpkin pasta dishes is the handful of crumbled amaretti biscuits added at the end. Those crispy little cookies add a surprising touch—just the right amount of crunch and a hint of almond that wakes up the whole plate. It's so, so good. This combo comes from the region’s famous tortelli di zucca , where pumpkin and amaretti have been paired together for ages, especially in classic Mantuan recipes.
You end up with a bowl that’s creamy and a little bit sweet, with a flavor that feels warm and fragrant—totally autumn in every bite. I mean, instead of the usual pumpkin pasta, you get something a bit more festive, almost like a shortcut to pumpkin ravioli but way, way easier to throw together. Folks in Lombardy keep it simple: short ingredient list, quick cooking time, perfect for a family lunch or when you want something elegant but low-effort for dinner guests.
Those amaretti crumbs? They’re not just for show—they really bring out the pumpkin’s natural sweetness and make the dish feel special, almost like you’re having a celebration. Sometimes people add a touch of sage or even a bit of browned butter to bring out that sage butter sauce vibe. But to be honest, even just as it is, this pumpkin pasta recipe manages to be both comforting and a little fancy. Perfect for chilly nights when you want something moist and satisfying.
Once you’ve tried it, plain pumpkin pasta just won’t taste the same—it’s one of those traditional Italian recipes you’ll end up thinking about all season long. Whether you're planning a cozy dinner or a festive gathering, this dish will surely impress and delight everyone at the table.
