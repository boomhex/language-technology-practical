Garden Russian salad, or l'insalata russa—as they call it—really shines in the Piedmont region of Northern Italy, especially around the holidays. This Russian salad recipe ? A must-have at any festive gathering. It's all about the creamy and tender mix of veggies and that homemade mayo. Really good stuff. What makes the Piedmontese version so special? It's the fresh, seasonal ingredients like broccolo romano, purple potatoes, and carrots. Sometimes, there's even a bit of cooked salami thrown in for an extra twist. The flavors just meld in a rich, cozy way that's super hard to resist, especially when this traditional Russian salad is homemade—way, way better than store-bought.
Local spots like Escola e Lou Mulin keep things exciting. They swap in cauliflower or other garden finds, making each bite a new experience. No question. This Olivier salad is a staple at Christmas, a starter that showcases local tastes and brings people together. And honestly, it is encouraged to change up the Russian salad ingredients . People in Piedmont love using what's at hand to craft their own version. The real secret? That homemade mayonnaise, which makes everything extra silky and moist, and gives the salad a comforting flavor that's like big family meals.
Unlike simpler versions elsewhere, the Piedmont take can have little surprises—slices of salami or vibrant veggie colors. It can be as fancy or as down-to-earth as you want, fitting perfectly at a big party or even as a weekend snack. Compared to the classic Russian salad that’s widely known, this Piedmont version feels more personal and fresh, with pride in local produce. Whether served as an appetizer, a side, or scooped up with some crispy bread, this salad always brings a bit of sweet nostalgia and Northern Italian tradition to the table. Really, it shows how regional variations make a dish unique and deeply connected to the land it comes from. Which is great.

To prepare the Russian garden salad, start by taking the florets of cauliflower and broccoli, peel carrot and onion, wash the potatoes. Steam the vegetables, they should remain firm. Then let them cool down slightly and cut them into rather large cubes. Cut and add the cooked salami to the vegetables. Adjust the vegetables with salt. Prepare the mayonnaise by working the egg with an electric mixer (or by hand very quickly and vigorously) together with the lemon juice, emulsify and then pour in the seed oil in a thin stream to control the consistency gradually. Once the optimal consistency is reached, also add the teaspoon of mustard. Dress the vegetables with the mayonnaise and enjoy your Russian garden salad!
The Russian garden salad keeps in the refrigerator for about 3 days in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
Enjoy the Russian garden salad all year round, varying the vegetables according to seasonal availability.
