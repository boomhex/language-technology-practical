Your muffins are ready for baking : in a preheated static oven at 350°F, for about 20 minutes. Always do the toothpick test for safety; when they're ready, let them cool . Then prepare the lemon glaze: gradually add powdered sugar and lemon juice .
Mix with the whisk , you should get a smooth and fluid mixture . Spread the glaze on each muffin with the help of a spoon
and decorate each with half a lemon slice and a fresh mint leaf . Here are your soft lemon muffins ready !
Soft lemon muffins keep in a cool, covered place for 3-4 days.
