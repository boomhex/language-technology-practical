instructions:
Stuffed zucchini flowers are a delicious and timeless appetizer. In this recipe, we present the most classic and beloved filling: a creamy and flavorful mix based on ricotta, anchovies, and mozzarella, enhanced by a note of fresh basil and lemon zest that adds fragrance and lightness. The contrast between the gooey heart of the mixture and the crispy exterior makes these zucchini flowers irresistible from the very first bite. But this preparation has a dual nature: you can choose between fried stuffed zucchini flowers or baked stuffed zucchini flowers for a lighter yet equally tasty version, with a breading that enhances the filling while keeping the delicacy of the garden zucchini flower intact. Serve them when you want to bring something special, simple but striking to the table, perfect for starting a dinner with friends or for enriching a summer buffet. In short, if you're looking for an appetizer that everyone will agree on, stuffed zucchini flowers are the right choice. Try them both fried and baked and decide for yourself which is your favorite version!
