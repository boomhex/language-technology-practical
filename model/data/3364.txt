instructions:
To prepare pasta alla checca, first bring a pot of plenty of salted water to a boil and pour in the rigatoni . Cook the pasta, drain it al dente , and transfer it to a bowl . Season it with a little extra virgin olive oil to prevent sticking, and let it cool slightly.
In the meantime, prepare the dressing: cut the burrata into strips and the Roman caciotta into cubes . Rinse the cherry tomatoes under plenty of fresh running water and quarter them .
In the bowl where you let the pasta cool, add the burrata and the cubed Roman caciotta . Also add the cherry tomatoes and the hand-torn basil .
Mix well to combine the flavors and season with salt and pepper : your pasta alla checca is ready to enjoy !
