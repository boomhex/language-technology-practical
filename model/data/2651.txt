Bicchierino con melighe, crema al cioccolato e zabaione al passito is this amazing Italian dessert that brings you straight to Sicily . Super tasty. Imagine crunchy melighe cookies—they’re big in Piedmont, you know—but here they’ve got that Sicilian twist. So here's the thing, you've got crisp, buttery biscuits with smooth, velvety chocolate cream, plus this zabaglione made with Passito di Pantelleria. This sweet wine is famous from a tiny island off Sicily. And look, the passito gives the zabaione a super aromatic, slightly sweet flavor that’s really, really unique. Seriously good.
The whole combo of rich, bold flavors and textures is just a delightful crunch and creamy goodness. I mean, in Sicily, this is the kind of dessert that ends a dinner with a bang—because it’s elegant and tastes amazing. Pretty simple. It’s got everything you want in layered dessert cups : tradition, a special twist, and a ton of comfort. Not everyone gets to try real zabaione with passito wine unless they’re in Italy. Which is great, honestly, but it’s one of those traditional Italian desserts totally worth making at home.
When you dig in, you’ll find this moist, silky treat where the chocolate cream desserts give that classic, deep flavor. Meanwhile, the zabaglione keeps it light and fluffy. Pretty much melts in your mouth. And those cookies? Still crunchy. It’s a fusion that sums up the magic of Italian dessert recipes —using local ingredients like passito wine to craft something both simple and kinda fancy. For real, people who love zabaione with passito wine often say this dessert’s perfect for dinner parties or any night you want to cap off with something tender and sweet. It’s like celebrating something special, even if it’s just Tuesday night. Can’t go wrong.
To make the glass with cornmeal cookies, chocolate cream, and passito zabaglione, start by preparing the chocolate custard: in a double-bottomed saucepan, pour the egg yolks, break them up with a whisk, then add the granulated sugar and rice starch , and also add the milk in a thin stream
and the cream while continuing to beat with the whisk to incorporate the ingredients. Heat the mixture and stir until the cream thickens. At this point, turn off the heat and add the chopped chocolate , mixing
until it melts. Transfer the chocolate custard to a shallow, wide bowl , cover with cling film touching the surface, and let it cool. Now focus on the zabaglione: in a double boiler, place the egg yolks, add the sugar , and beat with an electric mixer until you obtain a frothy and light mixture.
Then add the passito wine in a thin stream , still beating until it is well blended. Take a pot that can hold the double boiler, fill it with two fingers of water, and heat it on the stove, place the double boiler with the zabaglione cream on top , and heat for 10 minutes, always beating the mixture with the whisk .
When the cream is puffy and thick, transfer the double boiler to a bowl full of ice to cool the zabaglione quickly. Now assemble the glasses with a capacity of about 7 ounces: roughly crumble the cornmeal cookies , then place a layer of crumbled cookies at the bottom of the glass , take the chocolate custard, transfer it to a piping bag with a star tip, and squeeze some cream into the glass ,
then make another layer of cornmeal cookies and finish with the zabaglione . Finally, garnish the glasses with crumbs of cornmeal cookies . Your glasses with cornmeal cookies, chocolate cream, and passito zabaglione are ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the glass immediately and freezing is not advised.
You can enrich the chocolate cream by adding some gianduja and garnish the glasses with dark chocolate shavings.
