Whole grain cornetti with honey—seriously, who doesn't love them? They're a breakfast favorite up in Northern Italy, especially if you're into something a bit more tender and wholesome to kick off your day. And you know what? These whole wheat croissants are really really special. Why? Well, it is the whole grain flour that gives each bite a unique nutty richness. Really good stuff. I mean, if you're all about a healthy croissant recipe , this is it.
Now, let me tell you about the dough. It's got this moist texture—thanks to honey and brown sugar. And that means the pastry turns out not just sweet but also golden and kinda earthy. Italian breakfast is really about savoring the moment. You know, no rush here. The hand-rolled and folded dough makes those classic flaky layers we all love. Plus, there's that unmistakable Italian flair, especially when you get a whiff of the sweet honey baking away. So so good.
Here's the deal: taking your time with these whole grain croissants really pays off. After a nice slow rise, you brush the dough with a honey glaze . Looks stunning, right? It's got that golden hue and shiny finish—like you're right in an Italian bar. And look, in some parts of Northern Italy, they fill them with extra honey before baking. Which is great. It gives a surprise sticky sweetness inside.
People love these pastries because they straddle that line between dessert and breakfast. Pretty much the best of both worlds. And they pair perfectly with coffee, fruit, or yogurt. Making a batch at home? You're basically bringing a slice of Italian pride into your kitchen. The sense of satisfaction—knowing you took your time and nailed it—is unbeatable.

To make the whole wheat honey croissants, start with the dough. The butter to be added to the dough needs to be soft, so make sure to take it out of the fridge at least an hour before, if not longer. In a bowl, combine type 1 Manitoba flour and whole wheat flour , brown sugar , and yeast .
Pour in the room temperature water and start kneading with your hands until the flour is fully absorbed , then add the egg .
Also add the honey and continue kneading. Once the egg and honey are well absorbed, add the salt and knead for a couple more minutes , until fully absorbed.
At this point, add the soft butter, one piece at a time , always making sure it is absorbed before adding the next one . Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise for about 90 minutes, or until it doubles in volume. Timings can vary depending on the temperature or seasons.
In the meantime, prepare the butter for layering: take the butter out of the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for 5 minutes, then place it at the center of a 20x20 cm (7.87x7.87 inches) sheet of parchment paper (13-14). Roll the butter with a rolling pin to a thickness of about half a centimeter (0.2 inches) . Leave the butter sheet in the fridge until you use it.
After the rising time , roll the dough on a lightly floured work surface to make a 40x40 cm (15.75x15.75 inches) square .
Place the butter sheet in the center of the square to form a diamond shape , removing the parchment paper. Fold the corners of the underlying square toward the center of the butter sheet , ensuring the edges meet without overlapping. Seal by pressing with your fingers and let rest in the fridge for 10-15 minutes.
After this time, place the obtained square on a lightly floured work surface and roll it out with a rolling pin, lengthening only one side to obtain a rectangle of 50x30 cm (19.68x11.81 inches) . Proceed with the first 3-fold: fold the lower edge up to one-third of the rectangle , then overlap the upper edge . Cover the obtained dough block with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
After this time, roll out the dough block again to obtain a rectangle of the same size as the previous one . Proceed with the second 3-fold by folding the lower edge and the upper edge . Wrap the dough block in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for another 30 minutes.
After this time, proceed with the third and final 3-fold: roll out the dough block again to form a rectangle of the same size , fold the upper edge and the lower one, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rest in the fridge, this time for about 60 minutes.
After this time, roll out the dough block to obtain a rectangle of 80x25 cm (31.5x9.84 inches) with a thickness of about half a centimeter and cut out triangles with a base of 10 cm (3.94 inches) and height of 25 cm (9.84 inches) . Roll each triangle starting from the base to form 2 complete turns, being careful not to crush or tighten the dough too much .
Place the formed croissants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them well apart; you will then have 10 croissants with 3 turns each . Let them rise for an hour at room temperature away from drafts. Once risen, brush the croissants with the egg yolk and cream mixture and bake in a preheated fan oven at 356°F (180°C) for 25 minutes, being careful not to open the oven and monitor the baking. When they are beautifully golden, remove from the oven and let cool .
In the meantime, prepare the honey syrup: pour the water and honey in a small pot and bring to a boil , then turn off the heat and let it cool slightly .
Brush the croissants with the syrup and fill them with linden honey using a dessert syringe . Garnish with pollen granules, and your whole wheat honey croissants are ready to be enjoyed !
Whole wheat honey croissants keep for one day at room temperature.
Once baked, they can be frozen. You can also freeze the formed croissants while raw, before the final rise: you can then take them out of the freezer, let them thaw overnight in a turned-off oven, and then brush them as indicated in the recipe. Then bake them as directed. Alternatively, you can also freeze them once baked.
You can replace linden honey for the filling with one of a stronger flavor like thyme, dandelion, or chestnut, or a more delicate one like acacia or wildflower.
Be very careful not to wait too long between each fold because if the butter inside the dough gets too cold, it risks breaking when you roll out the dough.
This substitution is fine but the browning and aroma might be less rustic.
You can try using aromatic honeys like those with citrus.
Let the dough start to rise, then place the bowl in the fridge for 8 to 12 hours. The next day, let the dough acclimate before using it.
They keep for one day before becoming too dry, but you can always reheat them at a low temperature in the oven and consume them warm or lukewarm, this way they will still be a bit soft.
