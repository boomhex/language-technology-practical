The shrimp are always delicious, with pasta, in salad or tempura... and even more so when enjoyed in purity, like in the pan-fried shrimp recipe we propose here! An easy and quick main dish that even those less experienced with seafood can prepare without issues. To season the crustaceans, we made a gremolata, which is a mixture of garlic, parsley, and lemon zest that usually accompanies the classic Milanese osso buco but also enhances fish dishes.
After trying the pan-fried shrimp, you can also experiment with these other crustacean-based recipes:

To make the pan-fried shrimp, first remove the intestine of the crustaceans by cutting the shell along the back and gently extracting it with the help of a toothpick . There's no need to remove the shell, head, and legs. Heat the oil in a pan and sauté the shrimp for 2-3 minutes .
Once they are well sautéed, deglaze with white wine and let the alcohol evaporate completely , then season with salt . Lower the heat and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, prepare the gremolata: finely chop the garlic cloves , then add them to the chopped parsley along with the grated lemon zest . Mix well.
Add the gremolata to the shrimp and sauté for another couple of minutes to mix them with the seasoning . Turn off the heat and serve your pan-fried shrimp immediately !
It is recommended to consume the pan-fried shrimp immediately. Alternatively, you can store them in the refrigerator for up to one day.
If you prefer, you can add a grind of pepper or a pinch of chili to the pan-fried shrimp!
