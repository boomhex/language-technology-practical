Tagliatelle with duck —it's a classic for a reason. Seriously good for those chilly fall and winter days. In Northern Italy, especially places like Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany , folks know what's up. They take wide ribbons of fresh egg pasta and pair them with this rich, savory duck meat sauce . You bite into it, and wow, the sauce clings perfectly to those tender tagliatelle noodles. Really, it’s special.
Egg pasta isn’t just about looks; it’s made to soak up all the deep flavors from the duck ragu pasta . Unlike some other sauces, this one skips the tomato pulp. And look, that lets the natural, robust taste of slow-cooked duck really shine through. The key? Cooking the duck low and slow until it’s moist and falls apart—creating a duck pasta recipe that’s unforgettable.
It's the kind of dish that, to be honest, brings back memories of big family lunches. Everyone gathers around the table on a chilly Sunday, enjoying the traditional flavors of the north. Can't go wrong with a big plate of tagliatelle with duck when it’s cold out.
And here's the thing, the sauce gets its intense flavor from patience. Folks in the north, they know what's up—simmering the duck gently for hours enhances all its hearty qualities. And pairs perfectly with the wide, porous pasta. Some might compare it to ragù from other regions, but this one has that gamey, rich taste you just don’t get from beef or pork.
Every forkful? It gives you a little hit of those Sunday lunch vibes—warm, filling, and just a bit luxurious. This duck ragu pasta isn’t just a meal. It’s a reason to gather everyone around and share stories. Whether you’ve tried other traditional Italian pasta recipes or it's your first dive into Italian duck pasta, the flavors are memorable. Northern Italy knows how to do comfort food right—families keep coming back for more. No question.
To prepare the tagliatelle with duck ragù, start by preparing the Vegetable broth and then focus on the vegetables. Peel the garlic and set it aside. Peel the onion and chop it finely, as well as the celery. Trim the carrots and peel them: also chop them finely. The ingredients for the sauté are now ready . Heat a drizzle of oil in a non-stick pan with a wide base and high sides and brown a clove of garlic . When golden, remove it .
Sauté the onion with the carrots and celery over low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. In the meantime, take the duck breast: remove the fat with a sharp knife .
Then cut the duck breast into thin slices , then into cubes of about 1 cm : add them to the pot with the sauté .
Sauté the meat for 2-3 minutes, stirring well to promote even cooking . Deglaze with red wine and let it evaporate. Then extend with vegetable broth to season and promote optimal cooking of the meat .
Adjust with salt and pepper. Then cover with a lid and let it cook over very low heat for at least 1 hour, adding a ladle of broth when the previous one is almost completely absorbed. While the sauce is cooking, boil the pasta in a pot with plenty of salted water .
When it is al dente, drain it directly into the pot with the sauce which will be ready by then, mixing it well with the sauce . Then plate your duck tagliatelle and enjoy while still hot !
It is preferable to consume the duck tagliatelle while still hot. If there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator for up to 2 days well sealed in an airtight container.
You can freeze only the duck sauce if you used fresh and not thawed ingredients.
Want to give a more intense flavor to this duck sauce? Try deglazing with tomato purée while the meat cubes cook! You can also flavor with herbs of your choice: we suggest thyme and marjoram!
Duck has very fatty meat, so it is generally preferable to remove visible fat parts before proceeding with its preparation, as we did for these tasty tagliatelle. If the duck is roasted in the oven instead, it is sufficient to collect its fat in a container after about 20 minutes of cooking.
