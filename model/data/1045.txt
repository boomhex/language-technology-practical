instructions:
To prepare the zucchini gnocchi, start by boiling the potatoes for about 50 minutes or until they are soft . Test the cooking with a fork to check the consistency. Meanwhile, wash the zucchini, trim them, and cut them into slices , you will get about 18 oz. In a pan, pour the oil and add the garlic , let it flavor for a few moments,
then add the zucchini. Salt , pepper, flavor with thyme leaves and cook the zucchini for about 10 minutes over medium heat, or until they are cooked. The time varies based on the size of the zucchini .
Remove the garlic , pour the zucchini into a tall-sided glass and blend with an immersion blender ,
to create a puree then pass it through a sieve and set it aside to cool. Now pour the flour on the work surface, add the cooked and now cold potatoes, passed through a potato ricer .
Add the zucchini puree , paprika , and grated cheese .
Finally, incorporate the whole egg . Knead energetically until you obtain a homogeneous dough .
The dough will be very delicate and soft, take a piece of dough and form small logs. Cut the logs into pieces about 0.75 inches and gently pass the gnocchi over the gnocchi board . Cover a tray with a clean cloth and dusted with flour, place the ridged gnocchi well-spaced. Continue until you have finished the dough and then proceed with cooking, pairing the zucchini gnocchi with the seasonings you prefer!
We recommend consuming the zucchini gnocchi immediately. The dough is quite delicate, so we do not recommend freezing it.
To best savor the unique taste of these zucchini gnocchi, we suggest dressing them simply, for example with oil and sage. To better work the dough, we recommend letting both the zucchini and potatoes cool before adding them to the mixture.
