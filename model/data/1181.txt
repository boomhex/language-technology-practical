instructions:
To prepare the meatballs with mortadella and pistachios, first cut the mortadella into cubes , then place it in a mixer and finely chop it .
Pour the veal mince into a large bowl and add the chopped mortadella , grated Grana Padano PDO , and the crushed garlic clove .
Also add the chopped parsley , the egg , and the breadcrumbs .
Finally, salt, pepper, and add the whole pistachios . Stir with a spoon to combine everything , then pour in the water needed to soften the mixture .
At this point, knead with your hands until you get a soft but dry and firm mixture. Take a piece of the mixture about the size of a walnut and roll it between the palms of your hands to form balls: with these quantities, you should get about 22 .
Heat plenty of seed oil in a pan, fry the meatballs for a few minutes, turning them over until they are golden brown. When they are ready and evenly golden, drain with a slotted spoon and transfer to a sheet of absorbent paper to remove excess oil . Your meatballs with mortadella and pistachios are ready to be served hot or warm!
The meatballs with mortadella and pistachios can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days, taking care to reheat them in the oven at 350°F for 5 minutes before serving. They can be frozen before cooking.
Instead of water, you can use milk to soften the mixture.
