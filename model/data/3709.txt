Clean the anchovies by removing the head from each one , then butterfly them without detaching the two fillets and gently remove the central bone .
Quickly wash and dry the anchovies by blotting them with paper towels , then coat them in flour and fry them in hot olive oil , turning them on both sides; place the fried anchovies on paper towels to absorb the excess oil.
Arrange the anchovies in a container . In a saucepan, place the vinegar, white wine, salt, onion cut into wedges, chili pepper sliced, and garlic cut in half (or sliced) . Bring slowly to a boil, then cook for 2-3 minutes and turn off the heat; pour the hot vinegar mixture over the anchovies until covered , then let them marinate for at least 12 hours in a cool place.
After the 12 hours, drain the anchovies, place them on a serving platter, and serve.
If you wish, you can add other ingredients to the marinade such as fennel, celery, or whole peppercorns instead of chili pepper. If you prefer a milder and less tangy flavor, you can replace the white wine vinegar with apple cider vinegar.
