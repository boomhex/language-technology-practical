The tradition behind these moist, buttery cookies comes straight from Italian kitchens, and each batch brings a touch of that vibe into your home. Whether served at a large gathering or a quiet afternoon coffee break, these Italian cookies add a sweet touch that’s always a crowd-pleaser. For real.
To make matchstick cookies, start by preparing the shortcrust pastry: remove the butter from the refrigerator and keep it at room temperature for about 20 minutes, then put the flour and the butter cut into pieces in a blender . Blend everything very well until you get a sandy and floury mixture; then transfer it to a large bowl and add the sifted powdered sugar , the seeds of the vanilla pod, two egg yolks, and a pinch of salt .
In the bowl, start mixing all the ingredients with your hands, then continue to work the dough on a pastry board : you should obtain a compact and elastic dough. As soon as the shortcrust pastry is ready, form a ball , cover it well with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator to rest for about half an hour .
After the necessary time has passed, take the pastry out of the refrigerator and start composing the matchstick cookies: to get a shape as precise as possible, the dough must be very cold, so we recommend dividing it into two parts and starting to work with one, putting the other back in the refrigerator. Roll out the pastry with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 3/8 inch , then cut it into strips about 8 inches long and 3/8 inch wide and cut them in half to obtain sticks about 4 inches long .
Repeat the operation with the dough you had stored in the refrigerator. Place the obtained sticks on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and bake them for 15-16 minutes at 356°F in a static oven . While the shortcrust pastry is baking, prepare the royal icing: using a stand mixer, whip an egg white until stiff , then add the powdered sugar, one tablespoon at a time, and a few drops of lemon juice, continuing to beat until everything is completely mixed . Do not overdo the amount of lemon juice added, otherwise the royal icing will have difficulty setting.
Now add the liquid red food coloring (or, if you prefer, in powder or gel) little by little, continuing to beat until you have obtained the desired color . When the shortcrust sticks are baked, after letting them cool completely, start with the decoration: dip the tip in the royal icing and place the matchstick cookies on the edge of a table, with the glazed end facing outward, to dry . It will take about 1 hour for the royal icing to dry completely, then the matchstick cookies will be ready and can be served and enjoyed as a snack.
We recommend consuming matchstick cookies on the same day, but if you wish, you can store them in a closed container for a couple of days.
You can prepare the shortcrust pastry in advance and freeze it wrapped in plastic wrap, and then compose the matchstick cookies at a later time. If you prefer, you can replace the vanillin with vanilla essence or a vanilla pod. If you don't have a stand mixer, you can use an electric hand mixer. If you prefer, you can make smaller matchstick cookies.
