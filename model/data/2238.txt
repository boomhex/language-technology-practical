instructions:
To prepare the sweet sanguinaccio, first combine the dry ingredients in a heavy-bottomed steel saucepan: sift the cornstarch and bitter cocoa using a sieve, then add the sugar ,
Flavor with ground cinnamon , pour in the cold milk , and stir with a whisk to blend and dissolve any lumps .
Move to the stove and cook over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes . It's important to stir continuously, especially scraping the edges well. As soon as the sauce changes consistency, remove the saucepan from the heat and incorporate the chopped chocolate .
Add the butter in pieces , then mix well until completely melted . At this point, transfer the cream to a wide baking dish and let it cool .
Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to chill for 2 hours. Before serving, vigorously mix with a whisk . Your sweet sanguinaccio is ready to be enjoyed !
The sweet sanguinaccio can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, covered with plastic wrap in contact.
You can flavor your sweet sanguinaccio by adding some liquor of your choice: if you prefer to lower the alcohol content, it is best to pour it while the sanguinaccio is still very hot.
Some versions include the addition of candied fruits and chocolate chips (when the sauce is cold).
To make the sweet sanguinaccio even more rustic and aromatic, replace the milk with a good full-bodied red wine!
