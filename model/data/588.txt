instructions:
To prepare the mortadella and peas conchiglioni, start with the seasoning: pour a drizzle of oil into a pan and add the garlic clove and the whole chili pepper . Sauté the ingredients for 2-3 minutes and add the peas . Sauté the peas over high heat for 5 minutes, turn off the heat and salt to taste. Remove garlic and chili pepper . Set aside.
Prepare the béchamel sauce: pour the milk into a saucepan and heat it . Put the butter in another saucepan and melt it over low heat , then add the flour all at once . Stir vigorously to avoid lumps.
Continue mixing until you get a golden mixture, the roux . At this point, dilute the roux by pouring first a little hot milk and then all the remaining . Keep stirring over low heat until you reach the desired consistency; cooking the béchamel for 5-6 minutes will give you a medium density. Salt to taste .
Flavor with pepper to taste . Once ready, pour the béchamel into a low, wide baking dish and cover with parchment paper on contact. Set aside at room temperature until use. Cook the conchiglioni in salted boiling water for 8-10 minutes, they should be al dente . Meanwhile, cut the mortadella into cubes of about ½ cm (approx. ¼ inch) .
In a large bowl, pour the béchamel, the al dente cooked conchiglioni . Mix the ingredients and also add the mortadella and the peas .
Season with thyme leaves . Mix everything to combine well the pasta and seasoning, then transfer to a 11x8 inch baking dish, sprinkle the surface with Parmigiano Reggiano PDO and bake everything in a preheated convection oven at 400°F for about 25 minutes, until the surface is golden. Remove from the oven and let the mortadella and peas conchiglioni cool slightly before serving .
The mortadella and peas conchiglioni can be stored for 2 days in the refrigerator.
For an even more pronounced flavor, mix 20 g (about ¾ oz) of soft cheese like taleggio, gorgonzola, or brie into the hot béchamel! In addition, or as an alternative to the cheese, you can use breadcrumbs.
