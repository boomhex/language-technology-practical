You know what’s amazing? This dish from Southern Italy, called peperoni al forno saporiti, really lets simple ingredients shine. Really, really good. Peppers are roasted with a handful of classic Mediterranean items—like salty olives, tangy capers, and sun-dried tomatoes—plus crunchy toasted bread cubes that soak up all those flavors. Super tasty. The result? A side that’s a world away from plain vegetables. You get that mix of sweet roasted peppers and the savory hit from the olives and tomatoes, with every bite offering something a little different. Thing is, around towns in Calabria or Sicily, folks toss together this kind of mix as a go-to side for grilled meats or fish. But honestly, these baked stuffed peppers work any time you want something easy but full of flavor.
And here’s the thing: The bread cubes get crispy on the edges, soaking up all the juices—so nothing goes to waste—and everything gets that rustic, homemade vibe that’s really comforting. Outdoor lunches feel special with a tray of these savory stuffed peppers on the table. They hold up well even when they’re not piping hot, so you’ll see them at summer barbecues, picnics, or those big family spreads in Southern Italian homes.
Compared to the heavier ground beef stuffed peppers found elsewhere, this Southern Italian version keeps things lighter. And look, it’s a solid pick for anyone after a healthy stuffed peppers option. The focus stays on the peppers themselves—no rice, just veggies and that toasty bread—showing off what makes Mediterranean sides so good. People sometimes add things like anchovies or swap in different olives. Which is great. But the main idea sticks around: let those tender, moist peppers mix with salty, briny bites and a little bit of crunch. It’s an easy stuffed peppers recipe that proves you don’t need a lot of ingredients for something really tasty. And look, you can riff on it however you like—try different colored peppers or even toss in some fresh herbs for a twist. However you do it, this is one of those bell pepper recipes you’ll come back to again and again.
