instructions:
To prepare the meat ravioli, first place the flour in a mound and put the eggs in its center. Gradually incorporate the flour with a fork and then knead until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough . Wrap it with plastic wrap and let it rest in a cool, dry place for 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, focus on the filling: soak the stale bread in milk . In another bowl, combine the ground beef and pork. Add the Parmesan and the egg .
Also add the well-squeezed bread , nutmeg , salt, and pepper .
Mix with your hands to obtain a homogeneous mixture , then transfer it to a piping bag . Take the dough and dust it with flour .
Roll out the dough with a pasta maker or a rolling pin until it has a thickness of about 1/16-1/8 inch. Divide it in half , brush one with water, then place small heaps of filling at a distance of 1-1.5 inches from each other .
Place the other sheet on top, matching the edges, then use your hands to remove the air around the filling and press the two sheets together well. Trim the edges with a pasta cutter, and cut to create square ravioli about 1.5 inches on each side . Cook the ravioli in boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes or until they float to the surface.
In a pan, melt the butter over medium heat, add the sage , and let it flavor until the butter becomes golden and the sage crispy. Drain the ravioli and transfer them to the pan . Sauté gently for 1 minute.
Plate the ravioli, add a tablespoon of melted butter , and finish with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan . Your meat ravioli are ready to be enjoyed !
Meat ravioli should be consumed as soon as they are ready, but if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator in a closed container for 1 day. Raw ravioli can be stored in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap on a floured tray, making sure they do not stick together, for 1 day. If you wish to freeze them, transfer them to the freezer directly on the tray. Once frozen, you can collect them in a food bag and store them for up to 2 months.
Besides the classic butter and sage, you can serve them with a simple tomato sauce or a delicate cheese cream.
