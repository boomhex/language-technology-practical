Pressure cooker pot roast is, honestly, such a beloved dish in Italian homes. It’s perfect, really, for a special Sunday lunch or a cozy holiday meal when time is short. And you know what? In Italy, families have various ways to make roast beef—sometimes in the oven or a pan—but using a pressure cooker gives you tender and juicy slices in a fraction of the time. What sets this beef pot roast recipe apart is how it locks in those amazing flavors. Really, the rich taste comes from the soffritto—a mix of onions, carrots, and celery cooked down until everything smells incredible, making the base sweet and savory. Even with less cooking time, the meat stays juicy, the sauce is super flavorful, and everything just captures that Italian vibe of coming together over really really good food.
Italian family gatherings often mean a big table, lots of laughter, and something like an Instant Pot pot roast right in the center, ready to share. Which is great. The pressure cooker version is fantastic for busy days or when you want a quick pot roast that still feels special. It’s a fun twist on old traditions—families in regions like the North might add a splash of red wine, while others stick to broth. Either way, you get tender chunks that basically fall apart when you cut them. That golden gravy from the soffritto? Perfect for spooning over the meat or sopping up with some bread. So so good. The whole dish turns into an Italian-style comfort food—no fuss, just great taste, and a wonderfully moist result every time. Whether you’re trying a classic pressure cooker pot roast for a family dinner or want an easy pot roast recipe that’s quick and full of flavor, this dish really brings everyone to the table, no matter where you are. Enjoy the rich tradition and warmth that this Italian staple offers, making each meal feel like a celebration of togetherness and good taste.

How do you use a pressure cooker?
It's important not to overfill the pressure cooker. Usually, a mark inside the pot indicates the level not to exceed: generally 2/3. For foods that increase in volume, like rice, it's recommended not to exceed half. Before starting cooking, make sure the lid is properly closed and the valve is shut. As soon as the pot reaches pressure, you can lower the heat to keep the steam release from the valve as constant and "gentle" as possible. By keeping it to a minimum, you will also save energy.
How do you open a pressure cooker?
Never open the lid while steam is escaping from the valve. After cooking, you must release all the steam by lifting or rotating the valve, and once the pot is no longer under pressure, you can open the lid. Be careful with the steam jet during the "decompression" moment.
