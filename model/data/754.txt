instructions:
To make the yogurt gateau, pour the eggs and cane sugar into a bowl , then add the grated zest and lemon juice . Stir vigorously with a whisk to combine everything.
Add the cornstarch and stir again to prevent lumps from forming, then pour in the yogurt . Stir until a smooth mixture is obtained .
Butter and sprinkle with cane sugar a mold with a base diameter of 8 inches, top diameter of 8.5 inches, and height 2 inches . Pour the mixture into the mold and bake in a preheated static oven at 390°F for 50 minutes, on the lower rack .
Once cooked, remove from the oven and let the gateau cool before turning it upside down onto a plate , then place it to cool in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. After this time, garnish your yogurt gateau as desired, for example with berries, powdered sugar, and a few mint leaves !
The yogurt gateau can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, covered with plastic wrap.
Freezing is not recommended.
You can give your yogurt gateau a different flavor each time by using other types of yogurt, such as fruit or coffee!
You can replace the whole cane sugar with granulated sugar or cane sugar, bearing in mind that the final color will be slightly different.
If you wish, you can enrich the batter with about 2 oz of chocolate chips.
