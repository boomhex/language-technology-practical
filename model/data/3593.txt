instructions:
First, clean the vegetables, then cut the carrot into strips , the red pepper , and the green one .
In a large pan or, if you have it, in a wok, heat 3 tablespoons of oil, then add the sliced garlic and spring onion , sauté for a few moments and then add the sliced chili pepper . Let it flavor and then add the peppers
the carrot , the bean sprouts , and finally the champignon mushrooms . Allow a couple of minutes between the addition of each ingredient.
Cook all the vegetables together for about 10 minutes over low heat and then pour in the soy sauce and apple or rice vinegar . Then taste for salt and add more according to your preferences if necessary. Then let it cook for a couple of minutes over low heat. Meanwhile, bring salted water to a boil in a pot, and once it reaches a boil, dip the noodles and boil them for no more than 2 minutes , then drain them and rinse them under cold water. Drain them well, then divide them into 4 nests of roughly the same size and place them on a sheet of absorbent paper.
In a non-stick pan, heat some seed oil and when it reaches temperature, dip one nest at a time in the boiling oil . For this operation, we recommend placing each nest on a skimmer and maintaining the shape of the nests with the help of a large fork. When the nest is golden, turn it over and let it brown on both sides. Then proceed in the same way with the other nests and let them drain on absorbent paper . Then serve one nest per person and top it with the vegetable sauce .
