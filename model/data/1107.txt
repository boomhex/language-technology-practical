instructions:
To prepare baked gratin orecchiette, first, bring a pot of water to a boil for the orecchiette. Clean the zucchini and cut them into cubes . Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan and brown the bacon cubes over high heat , then add the zucchini .
Season with salt and pepper and cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, salt the water that has come to a boil and cook the orecchiette . Drain the pasta al dente and add it directly to the pan with the zucchini and bacon . Mix briefly and remove from heat.
At this point, add the stracchino and the basil leaves torn by hand, then mix again and transfer everything to a baking dish .
Add the brie in pieces , sprinkle with grated Parmigiano Reggiano , and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 15 minutes until the surface is nicely golden brown. Your baked gratin orecchiette are ready to be taken out of the oven and served !
Baked gratin orecchiette can be stored in the refrigerator for about 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
For an even more stringy effect, you can add diced mozzarella! Replace the bacon with sautéed leeks to make a vegetarian version.
