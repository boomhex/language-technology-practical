Every December in Sweden, the lussekatter recipe really takes center stage with these golden, S-shaped buns that just scream Santa Lucia celebration. I mean, this unique Swedish holiday is all about bringing light and warmth to those cold, dark winter days. So, so festive. These Swedish saffron buns pop up all over the country on December 13th.
And you know what? As they bake, they fill homes with this sweet, floral, and slightly earthy saffron scent. It's really something. That spice gives the buns their distinctive golden hue. Really sets them apart from other holiday breads across Europe. Plus, each bun often has a raisin or two nestled into its swirl, turning tender and juicy right in the oven. The name "lussekatter"—meaning "Lucia cats"—comes from their playful, curled shape that, honestly, resembles little cats.
For many Swedish families, making St. Lucia buns isn't just about the taste. It's about preserving tradition and enjoying those delicious results. Kids dress in white robes, wearing crowns of candles, and go house to house handing out festive Swedish pastries like these. And here's the thing: this tradition is so cherished, and the warm aroma of these buns baking makes everything feel extra special.
Unlike Italian Christmas breads, these focus on saffron and have a soft, moist texture. Not to mention their unique shape. Some people swap raisins for currants or even play around with different shapes, but no matter how they look, these buns mark Lucia Day like no other. The lussekatter recipe has become such a staple in Scandinavian Christmas traditions. It's celebrated for its tender crumb and rich saffron taste.
Enjoying a warm St. Lucia bun, fresh from the oven, makes those long winter days feel a little less dark and a whole lot cozier. This beautiful tradition brings families together, highlighting the cultural significance of these buns in Swedish heritage. No question, they remain a beloved treat year after year.
To make the Saint Lucia Buns (Lussekatter), first soak the raisins in lukewarm water for about 15 minutes . Dissolve the fresh yeast in 50 g of milk at room temperature . In a saucepan, pour the remaining milk and flavor it with powdered saffron .
Transfer everything to the stove and heat until it reaches around 95°F (to be measured with a kitchen thermometer). At this point, proceed with the dough: in the bowl of the stand mixer fitted with a hook, pour the flour , the saffron-flavored milk
the yeast dissolved in milk , the sugar , start the mixer to coarsely mix the ingredients, then add the pinch of salt .
Continue to work the dough until you get a uniform and compact dough. Add the softened butter piece by piece and work the mixture until all the butter is absorbed and the dough comes away from the sides of the mixer bowl . The dough should be firm and elastic, transfer it to a lightly floured work surface and briefly knead it forming a ball;
transfer it to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let it rise at a temperature between 77°F and 81°F for 2 hours. After this time, the dough will have slightly risen. Pour again on the floured surface and divide the dough into 20 balls of 70 g each . For each ball, form a loaf about 12 inches long and with a diameter of about 1.2 inches . While working with one ball, keep the others covered with plastic wrap.
With the help of a rolling pin, slightly flatten the central part of the log, leaving the two ends of each log thick . Starting from one of the two ends, roll the strip up to the middle of the strip . Flip it and roll from the other end of the dough.
This way, you will have created the first "S" shaped sweet . Place the raisins in the center of each spiral . Gradually place the Saint Lucia Buns on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and let them rise again for about 30 minutes.
Beat the egg in a small bowl , and brush the surface of the sweets after the indicated thirty minutes . Then bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 20/25 minutes, placing the baking sheet on the middle rack of the oven. Once baked, take out the Saint Lucia Buns , let them cool slightly before enjoying them!
The Saint Lucia Buns can be stored under a glass dome for a couple of days. They can be frozen after baking. It is possible to store the raw dough for 24 hours in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap.
