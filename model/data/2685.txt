instructions:
To make the capers fritters, start by preparing the batter: separate the egg whites from the yolks and beat the yolks with a whisk , then gradually add the milk while continuing to mix to obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Incorporate the sifted flour , salt, and mix with the whisk to combine ; you should obtain a smooth, fluid, and lump-free batter.
Separately, beat the egg whites to stiff peaks (7-8) using a stand mixer with a whisk attachment (or an electric mixer) and gently fold them into the batter with a spatula to avoid deflating them .
Take the fresh capers, remove the stems, rinse them under running water, dry them by patting with a kitchen towel, and then place them in the batter (10-11). Heat the oil for frying: pour the vegetable oil into a pan and when it reaches a temperature of 340°F, take a spoonful of the batter and dip it into the hot oil to form the fritter; cook for about 2 minutes per side (cook a few fritters at a time to keep the oil temperature stable).
Drain the fritters when they are golden brown and place them on a tray lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil . The capers fritters are ready; enjoy them while hot !
It is preferable to consume capers fritters immediately and freezing is not recommended.
If you can't find fresh capers, you can use those preserved in salt, making sure to rinse them under running water before incorporating them into the batter.
