roll them on the palm of your hand to form balls and then roll them first in granulated sugar then in powdered sugar .
Press down the center of the ball with your fingers and then stretch the two ends, almost giving it a lemon shape . Place the cookies on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F (180°C) for about 12 minutes. At the end of cooking, they will be golden on the surface and well cooked on the bottom, remove them from the oven and let them cool .
Store in a tin box or a plastic food bag for 3 or 4 days.
We recommend using corn oil and not olive oil because it has a milder taste.
