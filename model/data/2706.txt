Pasta al pane —seriously good—is a delicious dish from Liguria , Italy. You know, where they love using everyday stuff like old bread in creative ways. And look, instead of just tossing it, they turn it into a creamy and tender sauce by blending it with milk. Pretty smart, right? Then, they kick it up with chili pepper and fresh parsley. Truthfully, folks in Liguria have a knack for making simple food exciting. Not just plain noodles here. Nope. There's a mix of crunchy toasted breadcrumbs sprinkled on top just before serving. Adds a pleasant contrast, for sure.
True to so many traditional Italian pasta recipes , it’s really really bursting with flavor. Thanks to anchovy fillets, Taggiasca olives —a Ligurian specialty—and sometimes sweet confit cherry tomatoes. The meal? Rustic yet special due to these thoughtful touches.
So here's the thing, when you’re craving a quick yet flavorful meal, pasta al pane is perfect. Especially if you’re tired of the same old butter and cheese routine. The sauce becomes smooth and moist from the milk-soaked bread, while the toasted breadcrumbs add a crispy bite. Seriously good. And you can totally mix it up. Throw in extra olives or swap in fresh herbs if you're feeling creative.
Some say this Italian bread pasta offers a fun twist on the classic pasta with bread crumbs seen in other regions like Sicily. But honestly, here it feels more like a creamy Ligurian comfort food, not a Sicilian baked dish. And look, there’s something cool about turning these simple ingredients—stuff you probably have already—into something that feels both familiar and a bit new. For anyone wanting to explore more easy Italian pasta dishes without much fuss, this one’s definitely worth trying. It’s all about those quick flavors and the golden, rich finish that makes Italian food so enjoyable.
To prepare the pasta with bread, start by roughly cutting the bread into pieces , place them in a bowl and add the milk , mix with a fork to soften them, then blend everything with an immersion blender
until you get a creamy mixture . Bring the water to a boil in a large pot and cook the spaghetti : meanwhile, heat the oil in a large pan, add the chopped garlic clove ,
remove the seeds from the fresh chili and chop it to add to the pan . Lightly sauté, then add a little pasta cooking water
and pour in the bread cream ; cook for a few minutes, and if necessary, add more cooking water so the cream does not thicken too much . Separately, chop 1.76 oz (50 grams) of breadcrumbs
and toast them in a small pan for a few moments , stirring occasionally: it will serve as the final seasoning. Finally, chop the parsley, then drain the pasta, keeping some cooking water aside ; place the spaghetti in a bowl and season with the bread sauce , adding a little water if needed.
Finish seasoning with the chopped parsley (16-17) and the toasted breadcrumbs before serving your pasta with bread!
Store the pasta with bread in the refrigerator for a maximum of 1 day in an airtight container and reheat as needed.
You can make the dish more intriguing by adding sliced Taggiasca olives or anchovy fillets well-drained from their preserving oil to the seasoning!
