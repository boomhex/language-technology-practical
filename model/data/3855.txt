Add the seitan to the saucepan with the vegetables and then deglaze with white wine ; finally, add a tablespoon of soy sauce , then season with salt if necessary and add the chopped parsley . Serve the seitan stew while still hot.
If you like, you can add various other vegetables to the stew, such as tomatoes, zucchini, bell peppers; cut them into cubes or strips and braise them all together, then add them to the seitan, following the recipe.
Seitan is derived from gluten, which is the protein part of wheat flour: it is a suitable food for those who have intolerances or allergies to animal products. Seitan contains many vitamins, minerals, and vegetable proteins; it has a high presence of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which help reduce cholesterol levels in the blood. The absence of cholesterol and the low sodium content make seitan suitable for low-calorie diets.
