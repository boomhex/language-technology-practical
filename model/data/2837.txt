It's the kind of treat that makes everyone—especially kids—stop and want a big slice. Combining American donut fun with clever baking tricks makes every bite a mini celebration. Pretty simple, right? For sure.
To prepare the donut cake, start by working the softened butter cut into pieces with the sugar using an electric beater . Split a vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds with the tip of a knife. Then add them to the butter and sugar cream along with a pinch of salt .
Also add the grated zest of 2 lemons ; then incorporate the eggs little by little and mix for another 3-4 minutes . Then mix the flour and baking powder ,
sift them to add to the mixture and continue working it with the electric beaters. When the dry ingredients are incorporated, add the milk in a thin stream continuing to work the mixture: you should obtain a fluid and homogeneous mixture .
Pour it into a donut mold with a diameter of 9.5 inches and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 50 minutes. Once baked, take the doughnut out of the oven and let it cool slightly before turning it out and placing it on a rack to cool completely .
In the meantime, you can focus on the pastry cream: extract the peel from an untreated orange ; in a saucepan, add the egg yolks with the sugar, beat them with a whisk , then add the potato starch and mix with the whisk to incorporate it .
Pour the milk in a thin stream and the orange zest . Mix well and place over low heat; continue to stir and cook the cream until it has thickened . At this point, turn off the heat, remove the orange peel
and transfer the cream into a bowl: cover it with plastic wrap in contact to cool it completely . When the two preparations are cold, you can assemble the donut cake: cut the doughnut in half , fill the base with the orange pastry cream using a piping bag .
Once filled , cover with the other half of the doughnut and set it aside while you prepare the royal icing: in a bowl, pour the egg whites together with a few drops of lemon, start beating them with the whisks
and when they are white, add the powdered sugar and continue to work the mixture: you should obtain a smooth, homogeneous, and fluid glaze. At this point, add a few drops of liquid coloring, we chose blue , until you reach the desired shade ; consider that once the royal icing has set, the color will be more intense and bright.
Spread the icing over the surface of the doughnut with a spoon ; to complete the decoration, sprinkle lots of colorful sprinkles on your donut cake (29-30)!
You can store the donut cake in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. The doughnut alone can be stored under a glass dome or covered with plastic wrap. The cream can be stored in the refrigerator covered with contact plastic wrap for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can color the glaze any color you prefer and maybe fill it with chocolate pastry cream to create a nice color contrast!
