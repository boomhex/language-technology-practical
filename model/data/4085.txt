To prepare the pasta with green bean pesto, stracciatella, and shrimp tartare, start with the pesto. Clean the green beans: wash them, remove the ends , and blanch them in salted boiling water for about 4-5 minutes . Drain them with a slotted spoon, without discarding the cooking water, and immerse them in ice water to stop the cooking and maintain a bright color .
Transfer the green beans to a food processor along with the basil and grated Grana Padano .
Add the pine nuts , a pinch of salt , and 2 tsp of oil .
Blend everything until you get a smooth and creamy mixture . At this point, clean the shrimp: remove the head, shell, and intestine (you can find all the details in our guide " How to clean shrimp "). Chop them with a knife and transfer them to a bowl, then season with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt.
Add the grated orange zest , mix well , and set aside. Cook the pasta in the same water in which you blanched the green beans and that you have meanwhile brought back to a boil .
Drain the pasta al dente and transfer it directly to a bowl where you have previously placed the pesto, thinned with a ladle of cooking water . Mix well .
When the pesto is well combined , plate and finish with pieces of stracciatella, the shrimp tartare , and some basil leaves . Serve your pasta with green bean pesto, stracciatella, and shrimp tartare immediately!
We recommend serving the pasta with green bean pesto, stracciatella, and shrimp tartare immediately.
The pesto can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days, in a glass jar, covered with a layer of oil.
The orange zest, already present in the recipe, can be intensified with a few drops of orange or lemon juice in the tartare: this will give freshness and a pleasant contrast to the dish. If you wish, you can garnish the dish with chopped pistachios or toasted almonds for a crunchy note.
Before consuming raw, marinated, or undercooked fish, it is recommended to freeze it for at least 96 hours at -0.4°F in a home freezer marked with 3 or more stars, as per health ministry guidelines .
