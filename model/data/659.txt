instructions:
To prepare the calamarata with black cabbage and 'nduja, start by cleaning the cabbage. Separate the stems from the leaves and cut them into pieces . Plunge them into boiling water, salted to taste, which will be used for cooking the pasta .
Meanwhile, in a pan, sauté a clove of garlic with a drizzle of oil and add the black cabbage leaves. Cook them for about 20 minutes , adding some of the cooking water from the stems as needed and covering with a lid. Once the stems are tender, drain them with a slotted spoon , keeping the water warm.
Transfer the cabbage leaves to a blender , add the stems and blend until creamy. Pour a generous drizzle of oil .
Add a little cooking water, the grated Pecorino cheese , and blend again until you get a smooth cream . Throw in the pasta and cook it al dente.
