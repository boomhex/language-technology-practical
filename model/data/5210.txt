instructions:
The dried fruit and caramel Bundt cake is a dessert that wins over with its intense flavor and enveloping softness. Starting from the classic Bundt cake recipe, this version includes the addition of a mix of dried fruit and raisins, previously soaked in orange juice, a touch that enhances every bite with citrus notes. Hazelnuts, peanuts, almonds, pistachios, and raisins blend together in the batter, creating a rich and delicious core that makes each slice a discovery of flavors. But the real final touch, the one that transforms this Bundt cake into a true delight for all senses, is the drizzle of caramel that covers the surface of the cake like a shiny and inviting glaze, seeping into the cracks of the batter, creating a wonderful contrast between its intense flavor and the cake's delicacy. It's a dessert that combines tradition with a touch of elegance, perfect for any occasion and capable of satisfying even the most demanding palates.

To prepare the dried fruit and caramel Bundt cake, first grate the zest of an orange and then extract its juice . In a small bowl, place the raisins and add the orange juice . Let them soak until ready to use.
Sift the flour , baking powder , and baking soda , and set aside.
In a bowl, crack the eggs, add the previously taken orange zest , and start working with electric whisks. You can also perform these operations with a stand mixer. Add the sugar and whip for 10-15 minutes. When the mixture is well puffed, lower the speed of the whisks and pour in the vegetable oil in a stream .
Do the same for the milk . Incorporate the sifted ingredients a couple of tablespoons at a time . Chop the dried fruit with a knife .
Drain the raisins and dust them with flour . Add the dried fruit and raisins to the batter . Mix gently from bottom to top to avoid deflating the batter .
Pour it into a 9.5-inch diameter mold , previously buttered and floured. Bake in a static oven, preheated, at 350°F for 50-60 minutes . Let it cool and then unmold, flipping it onto a wire rack .
Now, focus on preparing the caramel. In a saucepan, place the sugar and cook over medium heat. When it has melted and reached the typical caramel color, add the butter , salt , and stir.
Once the butter is melted , lower the heat, add the hot cream , and stir carefully . Turn off the heat and transfer the caramel to a heat-resistant bowl.
Add the chopped dried fruit to the caramel , stir , and let it cool to room temperature. Pour it over the Bundt cake . Your dried fruit and caramel Bundt cake is ready to be enjoyed.
The dried fruit and caramel Bundt cake keeps perfectly for 4-5 days in an airtight container or under a glass dome, maintaining its softness and fragrance.
Handle the caramel with great care because it is scorching. When adding other liquids, like cream, it may splatter or try to escape if you don't keep the flame low. When pouring the caramel, place a container under the wire rack to catch any drippings. You can vary the mix of dried fruit using your favorites or what you have on hand. Have fun varying by using, for instance, macadamia nuts, pecans, or cashews.
