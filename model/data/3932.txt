instructions:
To prepare kid goat in the Marche style, start by removing the fat from the meat and cutting it into about 12 pieces of roughly equal size ; season them with salt and pepper, wrap them in slices of bacon , and arrange them in an oiled baking dish (or oven pan) close to one another .
Sprinkle sage, bay leaves, and rosemary over them . Place the prepared dish in the oven and let it cook for about 30/40 minutes at 350°F (static oven), occasionally basting with white wine and a little hot broth . Meanwhile, prepare in a bowl the crumbled bread mixed with chopped parsley and crushed garlic .
After 40 minutes, remove the tray with the kid goat from the oven and sprinkle the dish with the previously prepared bread crumbs , then place it back in the oven for a few minutes with the grill setting. Then remove the kid goat from the oven and keep it warm, strain the cooking juices through a sieve and put them in a pan. Bring to a boil, add the Marsala wine and let it evaporate. Then add a ladleful of the remaining broth in which you have dissolved 1 level tablespoon of cornstarch, let the sauce thicken, pour it over the pieces of meat while still hot, and serve your kid goat in the Marche style!
The season for kid goat runs from late April to mid-June (so if Easter is late, it can be served instead of lamb). Whatever recipe you choose, always use plenty of seasoning to enhance the goodness and flavor of the meat, which is still developing.
