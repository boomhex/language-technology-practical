Begin by carefully washing the potatoes, then boil them whole with their skins on in boiling water for 30-40 minutes. Once tender — check by spearing them with a fork — drain and let them cool. Peel and mash them with a potato masher, letting the pulp fall into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt, mix, and allow them to cool completely.
Now, take the boiled potatoes, which have cooled, and incorporate a cracked egg. Mix thoroughly until the egg is well incorporated, resulting in a homogeneous and fairly soft mixture.
Sprinkle about 2/3 cup (80 g) of all-purpose flour onto a pastry board, creating a well in the center. Place a third of the potato mixture in the center and quickly knead with your hands, incorporating the flour until you achieve a smooth dough. If it's too sticky, add a bit more flour.
Take a portion and shape it into a cylinder about 2 cm (0.8 inches) thick. Dust the resulting cylinder generously with semolina. Use a knife to cut small pieces approximately 1.3 cm (half an inch) wide. Pass the gnocchi over a rigagnocchi board or the tines of a fork to create the classic grooves. Once ready, place them on a tray covered with a tea towel, lightly dusted with semolina flour. Your yellow gnocchi are ready.
While the potatoes are cooling, attend to the pumpkin: thinly slice, removing the peel, seeds, and internal filaments. Weigh out 140 g (5 oz). Place the slices on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated oven at 392°F (200°C) for approximately 20 minutes until tender.
Removing it from the oven, let it cool slightly, then mash it with a potato masher, allowing the pulp to fall into a second bowl. Add a pinch of salt and let it cool completely.
Now, divide the remaining potato dough into three parts. On the pastry board, form another well with 2/3 cup (80 g) of all-purpose flour. Place the pumpkin puree and a third of the potato mixture in the center. Mix the flour with the rest of the ingredients using your hands, gradually adding more flour if the dough is too soft.
Eventually, you'll have a homogeneous dough. Take a portion and shape it into a cylinder about 2 cm thick (0.8 inches). Dust it well with semolina and use a knife to cut it into pieces about 1.3 cm (half an inch) wide.
Pass the gnocchi over a rigagnocchi board or the tines of a fork to create grooves. As they're ready, place them on a tray covered with a tea towel lightly dusted with semolina. Your orange gnocchi are now prepared.
Proceed to cook the spinach: boil them in lightly salted water for 3-4 minutes until soft. Drain, squeeze out excess water first in a sieve and then, once cool, with your hands. Place them on a cutting board, finely chop with a knife (or use a food processor if preferred), and put them in a third bowl, setting them aside.
For the green spinach gnocchi, sprinkle 2/3 cup (80 g) of all-purpose flour onto the pastry board, forming a well. Place a third of the potato mixture and the previously chopped spinach in the center. Start kneading with your hands to thoroughly mix all the ingredients. If the dough is too sticky, you can add a bit more all-purpose flour.
Once you have a homogeneous mixture, take a portion and shape it into a cylinder about 2 cm (0.8 inches) thick. Dust it with semolina and use a knife to cut it into pieces about 1.3 cm (half an inch) wide. Pass the gnocchi thus obtained over a rigagnocchi board or the tines of a fork to create grooves. As you make them, place them on a tray covered with a tea towel lightly dusted with semolina. Your green gnocchi are now ready.
For the beetroot, blend the boiled beetroot with a pinch of salt in a mixer until finely pureed. Transfer the puree to a fourth bowl.
To prepare the purple gnocchi, pour 2/3 cup (80 g) of all-purpose flour onto the pastry board, forming a well. Place the remaining portion of potatoes and the beetroot puree in the center. Knead with your hands to incorporate all the flour, adding a little more if necessary, until you achieve a homogeneous dough.
Take a portion and shape it into a cylinder about 2 cm (0.8 inch) thick. Dust it with semolina, and using a knife, cut it into pieces about 1.3 cm (half an inch) wide. Pass the gnocchi over a rigagnocchi board or the tines of a fork to form grooves. As they're ready, place them on a tray covered with a tea towel lightly dusted with semolina. Your purple gnocchi are now prepared.
Boil the colorful gnocchi in plenty of lightly salted water. Remember to drain the gnocchi as they rise to the water's surface, using a slotted spoon.
The colorful gnocchi can be kept for about 2 hours at room temperature, lightly floured, placed on a tray and covered with a cloth.
Alternatively you can freeze them: first place them on a tray in the freezer and then, when they are frozen, transfer them to a plastic food bag. They will then be cooked while still frozen.
For tender and flavorful colorful gnocchi, it's essential to use a minimal amount of flour. The key is to ensure that the ingredients absorb minimal water during the cooking process.
The amount of flour required for gnocchi preparation may vary significantly based on the type of potatoes and pumpkin used, as well as the cooking method for each ingredient. Beetroot and pumpkin, being high in water content, may require a bit more flour.
You can enhance the colorful gnocchi with a simple sauce of melted butter, infused with a few sage leaves and a little grated parmesan. This ensures that their bright colors and distinctive flavor remain intact.
