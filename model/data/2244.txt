So go ahead, savor a slice, and let it transport you to the beautiful landscapes and rich traditions of Italy's Abruzzo region.
To prepare the Abruzzo dessert with almonds and chocolate, start by placing the regular and bitter almonds in a saucepan with plenty of water . Bring to a boil and let the almonds simmer for 4-5 minutes. Then, drain them using a slotted spoon and place them in a small bowl. Shell them one by one , also discarding the skin that covers them (you can also purchase already shelled and peeled almonds as an alternative).
Let them dry on a tray lined with paper towels . Once they are well dried, place them in a mixer along with 2 tbsps of sugar and grind them finely until you obtain almond flour . Begin to melt the butter in a saucepan, then once melted, let it cool slightly.
Then, in a bowl, separate the egg yolks from the whites. Whip the egg whites with an electric mixer until they reach stiff peaks . Proceed with the yolks: beat them with the electric mixer while gradually adding the sugar .
Continue beating until you obtain a frothy, pale mixture to which you will add the almond flour ; continue mixing to incorporate it into the mixture. Sift the flour and cornstarch together in a separate bowl .
Add the flours to the mixture, continuing to beat with the electric mixer ; also incorporate the melted, now cool butter . When the mixture is homogeneous, stop the mixer and gently fold in the whipped egg whites .
Be careful to incorporate them by moving the spatula from bottom to top very gently to prevent them from deflating . At this point, the batter is ready: butter and flour a 6.5-inch diameter zuccotto mold into which you will pour the mixture .
After leveling it with a spatula, bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 65 minutes (we do not recommend using a fan oven) . If you notice that the surface is becoming too golden, cover the zuccotto with a sheet of aluminum foil. Before removing from the oven, perform the toothpick test to check for doneness. Once baked , remove from the oven, let it cool slightly, then unmold by flipping the zuccotto onto a rack and let the dessert cool completely.
While the dessert reaches room temperature, focus on the coating: place the finely chopped chocolate into a bowl, set it over a pot of gently boiling water (preferably without the water touching the bottom of the bowl) and melt it in a double boiler, stirring continuously (22-23). Place a tray under the rack where you cooled the zuccotto: when the chocolate is completely melted, pour it over your dessert . If you want to maintain a shiny chocolate coating for longer, you can use the How to temper technique.
With the help of a spatula, spread the chocolate over the entire surface of the dessert and let the excess chocolate drip off . To achieve a smooth coating, give the rack a few light taps on the work surface to make the excess chocolate fall off. Once the chocolate has cooled and hardened, you can serve your Abruzzo dessert with almonds and chocolate !
The Abruzzo dessert with almonds and chocolate can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
You can also choose to freeze the preparation if you used fresh ingredients, without the chocolate coating.
The most "homemade" remedy to keep the chocolate coating shiny for longer is to prepare it 20 minutes before serving, so it won't have time to become dull. To personalize this traditional dessert, we want to give you some other tips to impress your guests: flavor the batter with the grated zest of an untreated lemon or orange!
If you can't find bitter almonds, which give the preparation its classic bitter taste, you could opt for using only regular almonds. However, to not miss out on the typical flavor of this dried fruit, you could add some Amaretto di Saronno and adjust the batter if it's too runny with some sifted flour!
