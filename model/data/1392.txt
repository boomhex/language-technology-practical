To prepare the shrimps in kataifi pastry with asparagus sauce, first clean the shrimps: remove only the shell while keeping the head and tail . Cut along the back and remove the intestine, which is the black thread . Add salt and pepper.
Now season with marjoram leaves and wrap the shrimps with kataifi pastry (5-6). Be careful to gently unravel the pastry and always keep it on a damp cloth to prevent it from drying out.
