instructions:
To prepare the "camille" type carrot cupcakes, start by washing the carrots well and peeling them , then finely chop them in a blender . In a large bowl, whisk the eggs with the sugar .
When the mixture is light and frothy, add the chopped carrots . Sift and mix together the flour, almond flour, potato starch, and baking powder and incorporate them into the egg and sugar mixture. Finally, add the zest of one orange and the seeds of a vanilla pod .
Then add the vegetable oil to the mixture, mixing well; the batter should be very soft . Line 12 muffin molds (about 2.5/3 inches in diameter) with paper liners (or butter and flour them) and pour the carrot mixture into each mold, leaving about half an inch from the top. Bake the cupcakes in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 20/25 minutes, until inserting a skewer into the center of one of the cupcakes and removing it, it comes out dry. Cool the camille, remove them from the molds, and serve, optionally dusted with powdered sugar.
Store the carrot cupcakes under a glass dome for a maximum of 2-3 days.
Following the same procedure and with the same quantities, to change the flavor but not the spirit of the recipe, you can make spectacular zucchini cupcakes: I bet a dinner that no one will guess all the ingredients!
