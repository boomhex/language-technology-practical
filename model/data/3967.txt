Golden crust and a crunchy bite set Ciaccia with Friccioli apart on any dinner table—this is classic Italian bread for families who want something truly SPECIAL in their bread basket. With its deep roots in Italian baking and Tuscan tradition, this rustic bread stands out thanks to bold, savory flavors from crispy pork friccioli . Soft, moist on the inside with a rich and slightly earthy taste, it really works for both noisy family dinners and quiet lunches alike. Kids and adults both love the surprise of crisp, DEEP flavor in every slice, while home cooks mention this good bread brings that warm, welcoming scent typical of real Italian bread straight into the house. Serious home bakers looking to capture the best of Italian baking usually choose Ciaccia with Friccioli because it's reliable, looks good, and checks that box for authentic experience with every bite. Plates come back empty...that's usually a clue!
Weeknight meals and parties both benefit from the adaptability—Ciaccia with Friccioli serves up alongside hearty soups, next to favorite cheeses, or even as an exciting, savory twist to breakfast (try it with a simple swipe of jam, honest!). Sometimes families just use it to round out a plate of roasted veggies, knowing this bread stands up to FLAVOR and doesn't get lost. Versatility shows in every serving—kids dip it, parents love it, and it's always a topic when gatherings get lively. Busy families appreciate a bread that sticks around as leftovers yet works just as nice alongside soups and stews the second time. The lovely golden color gives a homey vibe, while the crispy edge keeps every bite exciting. Enthusiastic bakers and home cooks tell their friends this is the kind of bread that makes you want to linger at the table, sharing stories and second helpings—a true staple when talking about Italian bread , friccioli bread , or that crave-worthy element missing from the usual routine. If easy, versatile bread with a great story and flavor is the goal, Ciaccia with Friccioli is definitely the way to go!
The first thing to do is to render, or slowly fry, the diced pork pancetta and let it cool completely. At this point, place the pancetta in a bowl along with the flour and a little pepper, and proceed as you would when making bread dough. Once you have a well-mixed dough, form it into a ball, wrap it in a towel, and let it rise for at least an hour. Once it is ready, put the loaf in the oven for at least an hour at 356°F, and once done, you will have your ciaccia with pork cracklings.
This type of focaccia is essentially prepared in the winter months, particularly between November and January, during which the 170 bakeries in the Grosseto and Siena areas produce at least 16,500 lbs.
The only true Tuscan ciaccia with pork cracklings has the shape of a “double loaf”: if you want to try it, just form a loaf with the risen dough and make a cut in the center, the baking will do the rest!
