Whole wheat biscuits are, I gotta say, a real staple at the Italian breakfast table—especially for those who are into light and healthy choices. Seriously good. These whole wheat biscuits focus on simplicity and natural goodness by using olive oil instead of butter for that rustic, tender bite. Across Italy, you’ll find unique touches, like a squeeze of fresh lemon or maybe grated apple for a hint of sweetness. Thing is, some keep it basic to let the wheat’s earthy flavor really shine. Others might throw in nuts or seeds for crunch—which is great. This healthy biscuits recipe is low in fat, packed with fiber, and perfect for dipping into hot milk or tea. These butter-free biscuits are about creating something wholesome and real—just like Nonna would make with whatever was on hand.
When you're craving something nutritious in the morning, these Italian-style whole grain biscuits are a great choice. And look, they have a nice golden color from the wheat, plus olive oil keeps them moist without being heavy. For those needing dairy-free biscuits or looking to cut down on saturated fats, these are a way way better swap. The easy biscuit recipe is flexible—swap lemon zest for orange or add cinnamon for warmth. Pretty simple. Some versions even go fully vegan with plant-based milk. For real. You’ll find similar low-fat, plant-based biscuits in various Italian regions, each reflecting local tastes and that Italian vibe of honest, home-cooked food. They’re crispy around the edges and so so soft inside, making breakfast or snack time feel special, even on busy days.

To prepare the wholemeal biscuits without butter, place all the dry ingredients in a bowl: the wholemeal spelt flour , brown sugar , and baking ammonia .
Grate the zest of an orange , add the beaten eggs while mixing with a fork . Also, pour in the rice oil in a thin stream .
You can start kneading by hand . When the powders have absorbed the liquids, transfer everything onto the work surface . Without adding flour or fats, knead until you obtain a compact dough. Form a ball and place it in the fridge covered with plastic wrap , for at least 30 minutes.
After the dough has rested, roll it out using a little spelt flour to a thickness of 1/5 inch . Cut with the chosen shape: we used a pudding mold with a diameter of 2 1/5 inches . Re-roll the leftover dough to form more biscuits; with these amounts, you'll get 30 pieces.
Place the biscuits, well spaced, on a baking tray lined with parchment paper . Bake in a preheated static oven at 347°F for 20 minutes. Once baking time is up, move the wholemeal biscuits without butter onto a wire rack and let them cool .
The wholemeal biscuits without butter can be stored for about ten days in a tin box.
Rice oil can be replaced with sunflower seed oil. Baking ammonia makes these shortbread cookies more crumbly, but you can substitute it with double the amount of baking powder. Wholemeal spelt flour is available in supermarkets, but if you prefer, you can use whole wheat flour, keeping the same quantities.
