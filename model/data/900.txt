instructions:
To prepare the mead, first heat the water to a temperature between 100°F and 113°F, measuring with a thermometer . Take a ladle of water and set it aside in a carafe, then pour the acacia honey and chestnut honey into the pot.
Stir vigorously to incorporate oxygen into the must to encourage the reproduction of yeasts during the first fermentation phase . Take a ladle of oxygenated must and add it to the water you set aside . Check that the inoculation temperature matches the one recommended on the yeast packet; otherwise, heat it slightly to reach the indicated temperature .
Add the yeast and stir gently , then seal the carafe with plastic wrap and let it rest away from direct light for about 30 minutes.
After this time, the plastic wrap will be slightly swollen, and foam will form on the surface ; if not, wait a few more minutes. Pour the yeast into the pot with the rest of the must and stir .
Transfer the mixture into a 1.3-gallon jug using a funnel and seal with a stopper equipped with an airlock . Store the jug away from direct light in a cool place with a temperature between 64°F and 68°F for at least 30 days and up to 60 days. During the first 7 days, remember to swirl the jug in a circular motion to mix the contents a couple of times a day. After this fermentation period, transfer the mead to another jug, being careful to leave the sediment at the bottom .
Place the jug again in a cool place and wait about 2 weeks for the yeast residues to settle further . After this time, proceed to bottle the mead using a funnel . Store the bottles in a cool place away from direct light and let them age for a minimum of 3 months up to a maximum of 12 months . Your mead will then be ready to be enjoyed!
Mead can be stored for several months. Prolonging the aging and storage time will enhance its characteristics.
If you don’t have a stopper with an airlock, you can use a balloon that you have previously washed; in this case, however, remember to deflate it from time to time.
For bottling the mead, preferably choose glass bottles with airtight mechanical closures.
Feel free to choose other types of honey and vary the combinations to obtain different flavors.
You can replace a small portion of water with pulp-free fruit juice, such as apple or grape juice.
The expression “honeymoon” is believed to originate from mead: according to an ancient custom, it was given as a gift to newlywed couples in quantities sufficient to last for a month. In addition to being a symbol of fertility and good luck, it was also considered a tonic that would provide the spouses with the necessary energy to spend the first nights of marriage together, corresponding to a lunar phase!
