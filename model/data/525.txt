To prepare the kid goat in a pan, first marinate the meat: place the pieces of kid goat in a bowl, then add the white wine , the bay leaves , and the crushed garlic clove .
Also add the thyme sprigs and the peppercorns . Make sure the marinade completely covers the meat and let it marinate at room temperature for at least 2 hours . In the meantime, prepare the meat broth that you will use to cook the kid goat.
After this time, drain the marinade and set aside the meat with the aromas . Prepare the rest of the ingredients: peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes , then clean the onions and slice them thinly .
Heat a large pan with a drizzle of oil, then add the potatoes and brown them for about ten minutes. Add the onions and sauté for 3 minutes over medium heat, then lower the heat, salt , and pepper.
Deglaze with 50 ml (1.7 oz) of white wine , cover with the lid, and continue cooking for 5 minutes . Once cooked, remove the potatoes and onions from the pan and set them aside .
In the same pan, heat another drizzle of oil, then add the pieces of kid goat along with the marinade aromas and brown them well on all sides over high heat . Salt and pepper .
Deglaze with the remaining 50 ml (1.7 oz) of white wine , then add the potatoes and onions and pour in the meat broth .
Lower the heat, cover with the lid , and cook for another 15 minutes. After the cooking time , serve your kid goat in a pan immediately !
