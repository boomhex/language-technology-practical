instructions:
To prepare the mon sciù di pastiera, start with the craquelin: first, take the butter out of the fridge about 30 minutes before starting the recipe, so it has a soft and spreadable consistency. In a bowl, combine the plastic butter, brown sugar , salt , and flour .
Mix with a spatula until you get a homogeneous dough . Transfer the dough onto a sheet of parchment paper , cover with another sheet, and roll out with a rolling pin to form a sheet about 1/8 inch thick . Transfer the sheet onto a baking tray with its parchment paper and let it firm up in the freezer for about 15 minutes.
In the meantime, start with the choux pastry: pour the water and milk into a saucepan , then add the butter and sugar .
Add the salt and bring to a boil over medium-low heat, stirring to dissolve everything . When it starts to boil, add all the flour at once and stir vigorously.
When the mixture detaches from the sides, forming a white film at the bottom, continue stirring for a couple more minutes , then transfer it to a cold bowl and spread it out to cool faster . Now add one egg at a time , mixing thoroughly to incorporate it before adding another.
When you have obtained a smooth and elastic dough , transfer it to a piping bag with a 3/4-inch plain nozzle. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and draw 10 circles with a diameter of 2 inches and another 10 with a diameter of 1 inch; then, follow the outlines to pipe blobs of dough of these sizes ; this will make it easier to achieve round and precise puffs. Take the craquelin dough from the freezer and cut out as many circles of the same size, using a 2-inch cutter and a 1-inch cutter .
Gently place the craquelin circles on the corresponding size puffs . Bake in a preheated static oven at 410°F for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 355°F and continue baking for another 15-20 minutes. Once baked, remove them and let them cool .
Now focus on the lemon curd filling: in a double boiler, pour the lemon juice and grated lemon zest , then add the sugar .
Add the yolks and salt . Turn on the medium heat and let it thicken, stirring continuously with a whisk. When the mixture reaches the consistency of custard, turn off the heat and add the butter .
Mix well to dissolve it evenly . Pour the lemon curd into a bowl , cover with cling film touching the surface, and let it cool first at room temperature and then in the fridge . Later, transfer the lemon curd to a piping bag with a nozzle less than 1/3 inch in size.
Proceed with the pastiera filling: pour the cooked wheat and milk into a saucepan, then bring to a simmer, stirring often . When the mixture has thickened, turn off the heat and let it cool.
Meanwhile, combine the ricotta and sugar in a bowl , add the orange blossom water and mix well with a whisk .
Cut the candied fruit into small cubes and incorporate them into the mixture , then flavor with grated orange zest .
Add the lemon zest and finally combine the cooked and cooled wheat . Mix everything and taste to adjust the intensity of the aroma to your preference. Transfer to a piping bag with a 1/3-inch plain nozzle .
You are ready to assemble the dessert: take the larger puffs and make a hole at the base with the tip of a knife , then insert the piping bag nozzle and fill them with the pastiera filling . Do the same with the smaller puffs and fill them with the lemon curd filling .
Place the pastiera puff on the plate , then place a slice of dehydrated orange on top and crown with the lemon curd puff .
Finally, garnish with a thin circle of yellow sugar paste , a gold leaf, and a piece of candied orange . Your mon sciù di pastiera is ready to be served !
It's recommended to consume the mon sciù di pastiera immediately.
Empty craquelin puffs can be stored at room temperature in a bag, in a cool and dry place, for 2 days. Alternatively, you can freeze them after baking.
The ricotta mixture can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
Lemon curd can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days, or it can be frozen.
Using a mix of water and milk in the preparation of the choux pastry allows for a softer and more flavorful result.
The ricotta mixture for the pastiera filling can be prepared the day before, allowing the flavors to blend better.
You can vary the candied fruits according to your taste by using, for example, lemon, tangerine, or bergamot... the important thing is that they are citrus to give an acidic touch to the filling!
