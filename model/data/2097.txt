Straight from Italian kitchens, corn on the cob in foil , or ‘pannocchia al cartoccio’, is a real favorite. Seriously good. It’s that rustic, homey style that's just perfect for simple yet tasty get-togethers. You’ll see it all over Italy at backyard barbecues and informal dinners, especially during those warm summer months. And look, people love grabbing the hot, tender ears right off the grill or out of the oven. Eating by hand? Part of the fun. No fancy serving needed, just good food and good company.
Wrapping the corn in foil keeps it moist and really brings out its sweet flavor. Italians often add a pat of butter, a sprinkle of herbs, or maybe a dusting of cheese before sealing the foil—lots of ways to enjoy it. It's one of those easy grilled corn recipes that vanish fast from the table.
In different parts of Italy, some might cook grilled corn on the cob over open flames or fry it for that super crispy outside, but wrapping it as foil-wrapped corn is probably the most laid-back approach. The foil keeps everything juicy—seriously good—producing golden kernels perfect for munching while chatting. And you know what? The smell of hot, buttered corn and the way the crispy edges form inside the foil make it extra tempting. Big plates piled high, everyone just grabs what they want. It's pretty simple.
Whether you call it BBQ corn or foil packet corn , this dish just screams relaxation and is ideal for sharing at a picnic or around a backyard table. For the best corn grilling tips : grab the freshest corn you can find and, for real, don’t skimp on the butter before sealing it in foil. This ensures every bite is tender and sweet, just the way it’s meant to be enjoyed in Italy.
To prepare corn on the cob in foil, first remove the end part , then peel it while keeping aside the innermost leaves . Also trim off the silk inside .
Trim the base of the cob, which is the inner part where the kernels are attached , set aside the cobs and rinse the leaves you saved under running water , then pat them dry with a cloth. Now take a sheet of aluminum foil, place a leaf in the center, place the cob on top, and add salt ,
pepper, and wrap it with other leaves so that the cob is entirely covered. Then wrap the aluminum foil around the cob sealing both ends tightly .
Take a baking tray, sprinkle the bottom with a layer of coarse salt, then place the wrapped cobs on it and bake in a static preheated oven at 350°F for 35 minutes. Once cooked, remove the cobs and let them cool slightly before serving .
Corn on the cob in foil can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
For an even more intense flavor, you can spread some butter over the cob before wrapping it in foil; otherwise, you can serve them with delicious sauces.
