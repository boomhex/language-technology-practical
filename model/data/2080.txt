These Italian finger foods, straight from Northern Italy, are seriously a treat for anyone who loves a burst of flavors. And look, boats with parmesan cream and grapes are named for their shape—resembling little boats filled with creamy cheese and sweet white grapes. Forget your usual party snacks; these are a real upgrade. Each bite combines tender pastry with the smooth, salty taste of Parmigiano and bursts of sweet grapes, making them a hit at buffets and family gatherings. In places like Emilia-Romagna, chefs really, really love using Parmigiano in both the dough and the filling—ensuring a full-on cheese flavor in every part of the snack. Thing is, the contrast of crispy pastry and soft filling is amazing, but it's the way the parmesan cream meets the fruitiness of the grapes that makes these stand out among other grape appetizers .
Endive boats or small tart shells filled with this combo offer a fun twist for anyone tired of the usual easy appetizers. Honestly, these treats are popular at Italian-style buffets because once people start eating them, they just can’t stop. There's this cool agrodolce (sweet-and-savory) vibe happening—one second you taste the sharpness of the cheese, then right after, you get that pop of juicy grape. For real, it’s a classic move in Northern Italian snacks to pair cheese with fruit, and these boats really, really nail that balance. Plus, since they’re bite-sized, it’s super easy to grab one (or five) as you chat with friends.
Here's the deal: folks often make a big batch since these finger foods disappear fast. Whether you call them stuffed endive or tartlets, they work with just about any spread, bringing that mix of golden crust and creamy filling that keeps everyone coming back for more. They’re one of those Belgian endive recipes that elevate cheese and grape combinations, offering just the right amount of moist filling against that delicate crunch. Perfect for any occasion, these boats are sure to impress and satisfy any crowd.
To prepare the boats with Parmesan cream and grapes, start by preparing the savory pastry base, by pouring the flour into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Also add the Parmesan , the cold butter from the fridge cut into cubes, pepper, and salt , and the thyme leaves .
Turn on the stand mixer at medium speed, add the dose of cold milk in a thin stream , and let the mixer run until a rather compact mass is formed (if you don't have a stand mixer, you can easily make this dough by hand, trying to knead quickly and briefly to avoid warming the pastry too much). Transfer the dough onto the work surface (preferably cold) and work it just enough to form it into a loaf. Flatten it slightly with your hands. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.
After this time, retrieve the loaf and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1/8 inch . Using a 4.5-inch cookie cutter, cut out 6 discs . Grease 6 boat-shaped molds about 4 inches long and about 1 inch high with a fluted edge; place the dough disc inside, adhering it well to the bottom and edges .
Then, with a knife, cut away the excess dough to even the edge. Place a rectangle of parchment paper inside each boat and distribute ceramic balls for blind baking. Bake the boats for about 15 minutes in a preheated static oven at 392°F on the center rack.
While the boats are baking, prepare the Parmesan cream. Pour the milk into a high-sided pan and heat it without bringing it to a boil. Then, in another saucepan, melt the butter over low heat . Once melted, add the flour in a sprinkle .
Stir with a whisk to obtain a well-blended and golden roux. Gradually add the previously heated milk to the roux , always stirring with the whisk. Continue stirring and cook the mixture over low heat. When the mixture has thickened, remove the saucepan from the heat and gradually add the grated Parmesan cheese , mixing it into the mixture with the handheld whisk. You need to achieve a fairly thick consistency .
Transfer the cream to a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap , and let it cool. Meanwhile, the boats will be cooked; remove them from the oven, take out the parchment paper with the balls, and let them cool slightly before removing the paper with the balls . Then, carefully unmold them, if possible on a wire rack
so they can cool completely ; you can then start filling them: wash the grape berries and cut them into thirds lengthwise . Fill the boats with a tablespoon of Parmesan cream
Place the 3 slices of grape and a walnut half on top of each boat , complete with slivers of Parmesan and flavor with thyme leaves. Your boats are ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the boats with Parmesan cream immediately. The Parmesan cream can be stored for 2-3 days in the fridge covered with plastic wrap. The boats can be stored without filling for 5-6 days in a tin box.
Alternatively, you can use a common shortcrust pastry as a base and flavor it with thyme or, if you prefer, with oregano
