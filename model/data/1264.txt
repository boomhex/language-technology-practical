instructions:
To prepare the pumpkin cutlets, start by peeling the pumpkin; you should obtain 1 lb of flesh . Cut it into slices about a quarter inch thick . Then proceed with the breading. In a bowl, pour the coarsely ground breadcrumbs, cheese, then add salt and pepper ,
then pick the fresh oregano leaves and mix everything . At this point, you can bread the pumpkin slices. First, dip them in the beaten eggs ,
then in the breadcrumb mix and press with your hands to make the breading adhere well . Then proceed again by dipping the cutlet back into the eggs
and again into the breadcrumb mix . Press again so that it adheres well and repeat the same procedure for all the other slices . Now you can proceed to cooking: heat the oil to 330°F and immerse 1 or 2 pieces at a time .
After about 2 minutes, the cutlets will be golden brown , then drain the first ones on absorbent paper and continue with all the others. Here are your pumpkin cutlets ready, serve them hot !
It would be best to consume the pumpkin cutlets immediately because, although they can be stored in the refrigerator for one day, they will lose their crispness. Alternatively, we recommend freezing them raw and breaded, ready to be fried straight from frozen.
Thanks to this double breading, the pumpkin cutlets will be perfectly crispy and very tasty.
You can make some small changes to the ingredients, perhaps replacing the oregano with spices like smoked paprika or curry!
