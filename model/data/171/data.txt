Chickpea cream with shrimp, clams and parsnip is one of those dishes that really shows off the Italian knack for mixing comfort with a dash of sophistication. In southern Italy, chickpea cream is super popular—it’s like hummus but even silkier, thanks to a touch of tahina. That adds extra smoothness. And look, this isn’t just your average parsnip soup or a typical seafood chowder . It's got a rich, velvety base, with a nutty and slightly tangy flavor from the tahina. And the shrimp? So tender. The clams? Juicy and cooked to perfection. Plus, Italian chefs love to throw in fresh herbs like oregano and chives. They give it a fresh, almost aromatic kick, you know? The parsnip adds a nice crisp bite—really balances out the creamy texture.
Honestly, in different parts of Italy, you’ll find all sorts of variations—some folks add more shellfish, while others go for just shrimp. What’s really cool about this version is how everything just comes together. The shrimp and clams recipe isn’t just some garnish; it’s like a whole layer of moist seafood flavor that totally infuses the chickpea cream . And listen, the way the herbs and tahina blend with the parsnip soup base feels super fancy, yet pretty simple at the same time. Italians love serving this at family gatherings or special occasions, which is great because it feels special without being over-the-top.
Some might say it’s a twist on shellfish bisque or a smooth legume-based soup , but it really, really tastes like the Mediterranean coast. Every bite is this mix of golden and creamy flavors that you just don’t find everywhere. The combo of crispy parsnip and tender shellfish keeps things interesting. And, with every mouthful, you’re totally transported to a sunny Italian coastline, enjoying the sweet ocean flavors and earthy legumes—all perfectly harmonized. Whether it’s for a cozy dinner or a special celebration, this dish brings a touch of Italy’s culinary magic to your table. For sure.

Meanwhile, purge the clams according to our guide: How to clean clams . Move on to the parsnip: trim it, peel it 2 , and cut it in half 3 .
Slice the smaller part into 0.4-inch thick rounds 4 . Divide the larger part in half and slice to obtain half-moons again 0.4-inch thick 5 . Blanch the parsnip for a few minutes 6 .
Drain the parsnip and let it dry on a clean towel 7 . In a pan, pour a drizzle of oil, lay down the parsnip slices, season with salt, and roast on both sides 8 . When they are golden, transfer the slices to paper towels to remove excess oil 9 .
Now focus on the shrimp: clean them by removing the head, legs, and shell 10 . Cut a slit along the back of the shrimp 11 and remove the intestinal vein with the tip of a knife 12 . Transfer the shrimp to a tray lined with paper towels and keep them in the refrigerator until use.
Take the purged clams, discard any dead or broken ones that might release sand, then rinse them well. In a pot, pour the oil, add 2 unpeeled garlic cloves, and let them infuse. When the oil is hot, add the clams 13 and cook for a minute. Stir and deglaze with white wine 14 . Once the alcohol has evaporated, cover with a lid 15 until the clams are fully opened.
Once opened, transfer the clams to a bowl, filtering the liquid through a sieve, then set aside 16 . Shell the clams 17 , keeping some with shell aside for final decoration. Drain the chickpeas 18 , reserving the cooking water and a handful of chickpeas for plating.
Transfer the chickpeas to a blender, add some of their cooking water 19 , and blend for 5 minutes. Now add the clam juice and blend for another 5 minutes. Add the tahini 20 and blend again for 5 minutes, until smooth and homogeneous. If it is not creamy enough, you can add more chickpea cooking water. Strain the cream through a sieve into a pot 21 and warm gently.
In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil and roast the shrimp 22 until golden 23 . You are ready to plate: spread the hot chickpea cream at the base of the dish, sprinkle with finely chopped chives and lay down the parsnip slices. Continue with the shelled clams, the clams with shell set aside, the shrimp, whole chickpeas, and a few fresh oregano leaves. Your chickpea cream with shrimp, clams, and parsnip is ready to be served 24 !
It's recommended to consume the chickpea cream with shrimp, clams, and parsnip immediately. However, you can store the ingredients separately and assemble the dish at the moment of serving: the chickpea cream can be kept in the fridge, in an airtight container, for 3 days, or it can be frozen for up to a month. The shrimp and clams can be stored in the fridge, in an airtight container, for up to one day.
Salt the various preparations moderately because the clams and their cooking liquid already provide a good amount of saltiness.
If you prefer, you can avoid straining the chickpea cream with a sieve for a slightly more rustic texture. After transferring it to a pot, if not serving immediately, cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent drying.
