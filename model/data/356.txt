instructions:
To prepare the capon stuffed ravioli, start by placing the flour in a mound on a work surface and put the eggs in the center . Add a pinch of salt and gradually incorporate the flour using a fork .
Then knead with your hands until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in a cool, dry place for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the celery into small cubes .
Finely chop the onion and carrots as well. In a pot, pour a drizzle of oil and add the vegetables .
Add two crushed garlic cloves with their skins and a sprig of thyme and rosemary . Sauté over low heat for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Meanwhile, cut the capon into pieces .
Add the pieces of capon to the pot and brown each side until golden . Pour the beer into the pot .
Adjust with salt and pepper . Cover with a lid and let it cook for about 1 hour or until the meat can be easily shredded.
Remove the meat from the pot and let it cool a bit. Then shred the meat , removing skin and bones, and transfer it to a bowl. Add the cooking juices, vegetables , and Parmesan .
Mix until you get a homogeneous mixture. Let it cool completely and put everything in a pastry bag. Take the dough and divide it in half . Roll out the sheets using a pasta machine. Start with the thickest setting, then fold the ends of the sheet towards the center . Pass it through the rollers again, gradually reducing the thickness.
Proceed in this way until you get 2 sheets with a thickness of 2-3 mm . Brush one sheet with water and place dollops of filling about 1 1/2 inches apart .
Cover with the second sheet . Try to remove the air around the filling and make sure the two sheets adhere well so the ravioli won't open during cooking. Use a pastry cutter to shape your ravioli . Cook them in salted boiling water for 3-4 minutes until they float to the surface.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan and add the sage leaves . Drain the ravioli and transfer them to the pan , sauté gently for a few minutes. Plate and add the melted butter .
Finish with a sprinkle of Parmesan , a few sage leaves , and freshly ground pepper. Your capon stuffed ravioli are ready to be served !
Capon stuffed ravioli can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days at most.
You can freeze the uncooked ravioli by placing them on a tray well-spaced, then once they are firm, transfer them to a freezer bag.
At the time of cooking, simply cook them directly in boiling water without defrosting.
For a more intense flavor, use dark or craft beer.
As an alternative to capon, you can use chicken or duck to create a similar filling with different nuances.
