Fried or baked, we always like zucchini fries. But today we want to show you another cooking method and show you how to prepare air fryer zucchini fries, an appliance you won't be able to do without! One of the advantages, which you will appreciate the most, is certainly the fact that very little oil is needed to cook the zucchini ... despite this, they will be fragrant on the outside and soft on the inside. An easy to prepare and really tasty side dish, perfect for the whole family!
To prepare the air fryer zucchini fries, first wash the courgettes and trim them . Then cut them in half and cut into 1 cm thick slices .
Make sticks and repeat this operation for all the zucchini . Dab them with absorbent paper .
Dry them well and transfer them to a bowl. Drizzle with oil , preferably using a spray. Turn the zucchini well, add the breadcrumbs and mix again . Switch to cooking. We used a 30 liter air fryer, if yours is smaller, cook the zucchini in two or three times.
Preheat the fryer at 230°C for 2 minutes, place the zucchini in the basket or on the grill of the fryer and cook for 12 minutes, turning the sticks after 8 minutes. When they are golden brown, take them out of the oven , salt them on the surface and serve them .
We recommend consuming the zucchini sticks as soon as they are ready to preserve their crunchiness.
If you don't have a 30 liter air fryer you can use a smaller one. Cook the courgettes several times, making sure that they are well spaced.
If your air fryer does not reach 230°C don't worry; set it to maximum power and cook the sticks until they are golden brown.
If you like, you can flavor the breadcrumbs with dried oregano or other aromatic herbs.
