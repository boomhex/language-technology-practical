Mashed potatoes and lentils are a staple on many Italian holiday tables, especially around Christmas and New Year's. This combo? It's all about comfort and tradition. The mashed potatoes get really creamy with loads of milk and butter, turning into a cozy side dish that's way more special than your average potato. Italians call this classic "purè di patate," known for its moist texture—perfect for digging into on a cold night.
And here's the thing, adding lentils (or "lenticchie" in Italy) makes it more than just a side dish. In Italian homes, lentils symbolize good luck and prosperity, so serving this at a holiday dinner brings all the positive vibes with that rich, hearty flavor. Each bite? So so good. The soft potatoes and slightly earthy lentils just work together.
Some folks like to mix things up—using different potatoes or swapping in olive oil for butter to create vegan mashed potatoes . But really, the main idea stays the same: simple food focused on good taste and tradition. Plus, it's a healthy mashed potatoes option since lentils bring plenty of plant-based protein.
This mashed potatoes and lentils recipe is a winter favorite, but honestly, it is perfect whenever you crave feel-good comfort food that sticks with you.

Whether you are looking for a festive side dish or just something warm and filling, mashed potatoes with lentils pretty much covers all the bases.
It's one of those dishes where every spoonful feels like a celebration—just the thing for sharing with friends and family during the holidays. The inviting aroma and great texture make it a must-have on any festive menu, bringing together the best of Italian culinary tradition and heartfelt hospitality.
To prepare mashed potatoes and lentils, you can start by soaking the lentils for a few hours (you can skip the soaking step, as it is only necessary to slightly reduce the cooking time of the legumes) . Then drain them from the water and pour the lentils into a large container, also adding the bay leaves . Cover with plenty of water and cook them for 35 minutes on medium heat from the moment it reaches a boil .
Once cooked, let them drain well . In the meantime, prepare a mince of celery, carrot, and onion and pour it into a pan along with the oil , stirring often to prevent burning.
After about ten minutes, add the drained lentils to the mince , also add the rosemary sprigs and bay leaves and continue cooking for 7-8 minutes, adjusting with salt and pepper .
Then move on to the preparation of the mashed potatoes. In a large pot, pour the potatoes and cover with plenty of water, counting 30-40 minutes from when it comes to a boil, depending on the thickness . Always do the fork test to make sure they are all cooked: if the tines easily penetrate to the center, then they are cooked. Drain them and then peel them while they are still hot .
Immediately after, mash the potatoes in a saucepan , grate a little nutmeg, add a pinch of salt, and add the butter in pieces , cook over very low heat until the butter is melted. Meanwhile, heat the milk and pour it in as soon as it is boiling
stir continuously until you have obtained a smooth, fluffy, and homogeneous puree . At this point, you will have everything ready to plate in a cute terracotta dish if you prefer or in a simple serving plate the mashed potatoes and lentils, garnishing with fresh rosemary .
It is advisable to consume the mashed potatoes and lentils immediately. If you want, you can prepare the lentils in advance, even the day before, and garnish them later with freshly cooked puree.
Want even tastier lentils? Cook them with vegetable broth. If you want to reduce the cooking time, just use peeled lentils. For a tastier version of mashed potatoes and lentils, add diced pancetta to the sauté or accompany with a platter of mixed cold cuts.
