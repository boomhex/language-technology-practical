instructions:
To prepare the savory pie with potatoes and mortadella, start by peeling the potatoes . Slice them into 1/8-1/6 inch rounds and then immerse them in a bowl with cold water and set aside .
Dice the mortadella and the cheese . In a bowl, mix the eggs with the cream .
Add the grated pecorino cheese , thyme leaves , salt, and pepper .
Also add the diced cheese and mortadella , and mix. Unroll the puff pastry, with the baking paper, inside a fluted pan (the base is 10 inches, the top is 11 inches) . Prick the base with a fork .
Pour the filling and distribute the cubes . Drain the potatoes and place them on top, first forming a circle and then placing the other slices in another circle underneath .
Garnish the surface with some oil , salt, pepper, and finally the grated cheese. Bake at 356°F in a preheated static oven for 60 minutes on the lower rack. Let the savory pie with potatoes and mortadella cool slightly before adding a bit more thyme and enjoying it .
It can be stored in the fridge, once cooled, for 2-3 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
Try adding other types of cheese to your liking instead of Emmental, perhaps smoky flavors like scamorza or stronger flavors like spicy provolone.
