instructions:
To prepare the vegetable broth, take all the scraps from your vegetables . You can use any type and any edible part of each vegetable. You will need a total of 760 grams (about 26.8 oz) of scraps, including peels, vegetable ends, trimmings, etc. Then transfer them to a blender container , add the coarse salt , and blend everything until you get a puree .
Then place a strainer over a bowl and transfer the mixture inside, pressing with a spoon to eliminate excess water . Next, place a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet and transfer the vegetable mixture on top .
Spread it on the baking sheet evenly and bake in a preheated static oven at 248°F (120°C) for about 2 and a half hours. When the vegetables are well-dried, remove them from the oven , let them cool, and transfer them back to the clean mixer .
Blend them again until you obtain a powder . Then transfer it to a small bowl, and your granular broth will be ready to use .
The granular broth can be stored in a hermetically sealed jar for about 1 month in the refrigerator.
Add a couple of teaspoons of turmeric or saffron and aromatic herbs to taste.
