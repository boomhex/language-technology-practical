To make the pandoro wafer with ricotta mousse and Nutella®, first soak the gelatin in cold water, then prepare the syrup: pour 0.5 oz of water into a small saucepan, add 1.4 oz of sugar and bring the mixture to a temperature of 250°F. Place the egg yolks in a bowl and beat them with an electric mixer , then pour in the sugar syrup in a steady stream
and continue beating the mixture until it cools : this way you will have obtained a pate à bombe. Now heat about 0.7 oz of cream, squeeze the gelatin sheets and dissolve them in the hot cream , stirring carefully. Sift the ricotta into a bowl, pour the cream and gelatin mixture into the bowl and work everything with a whisk or spatula.
Add the remaining cream (about 2.8 oz) and mix again to combine everything. Now add the obtained mixture to the pate à bombe , gently folding with a spatula from bottom to top to incorporate it . Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill the ricotta mousse in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
In the meantime, you can prepare the red fruit sauce: pour the sugar, raspberries , redcurrants , and 0.2 oz of water into a saucepan
and cook briefly, just enough to dissolve the sugar . Transfer the sauce into a tall, narrow container and blend with an immersion blender , then strain it through a fine-mesh sieve and set aside.
After the mousse chilling time, you can focus on assembling the dessert: cut the pandoro into horizontal slices about 0.4 inches thick and use a 3.5-inch diameter pastry cutter to make discs . Place the pandoro discs on a hot pan and lightly toast them on both sides .
Once cooled, spread each pandoro disc with 0.5 oz of Nutella® , place them on a serving plate, and brush the plate with the red fruit sauce . Add a quenelle of ricotta mousse on top of the pandoro wafer
and garnish with a raspberry and a sprig of redcurrants . Finally, decorate the plate with edible flowers : your pandoro wafer with ricotta mousse and Nutella® is ready to be served !
The ricotta mousse can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. It is not recommended to freeze this preparation.
If you wish, you can flavor the ricotta mousse with cinnamon and citrus zest and add chocolate chips to taste!
