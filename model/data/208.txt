Eggnog is one of those classic drinks that just feels right around Christmas time in the UK and the United States. Honestly, it's a staple. With its rich and creamy texture, this eggnog recipe brings people together and sets the mood for cozy winter gatherings. Really good stuff. Folks usually whip up a batch using milk, cream, eggs, and a dash of nutmeg. You know, all the good things. Every sip is super velvety and a little fragrant from those warming spices.

Seriously good.
For anyone who loves a good celebration, it’s hard to beat the atmosphere that homemade eggnog adds to the holiday table.

This traditional eggnog is really tied to Christmas festivities in Anglo-Saxon countries. You don’t usually see drinks this thick and enveloping elsewhere, pretty much.
With just a few eggnog ingredients , you end up with a bowl of something that’s both sweet and a bit luxurious, kind of like a dessert in a cup. And here's the thing, the best part is how easy it is to make; even folks who aren’t big on fancy recipes can pull off an easy eggnog recipe and impress everyone at a holiday party. For real. Whether you’re gathered around the fireplace or just taking a break from the cold, this festive beverage has a way of bringing a little extra cheer to the room.
Its rich history and comforting flavors make it a staple that many look forward to each year. No wonder people keep coming back to this Christmas eggnog—it just feels special, year after year, and has become a beloved tradition in so many homes.

To prepare the eggnog, pour the milk into a pot, then flavor with vanilla , ginger , and cloves .
Add the ground cinnamon and grated nutmeg . Heat over low heat ; it should not boil, but just warm up without reaching a simmer.
Mix sugar and egg yolks with a whisk until they are light and frothy (you can also use an electric mixer for convenience). When the milk is warm, gradually pour it into the yolk mixture, straining it to remove the cloves . This should be done slowly, mixing well each time you add the milk , so the eggs don't cook.
Once all the milk is incorporated, return the liquid to the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, alternating between a whisk and a spatula. Be careful not to let the mixture curdle or form lumps. You can stop cooking when the mixture is thickened, smooth, and when you dip a spoon in it, it comes out coated and veiled . Now fill a pot with cold water and ice and place an empty bowl inside, preferably cold. Pour the mixture into the bowl and stir to cool it down.
Then add the brandy and stir again . Finally, add the cream .
Gently stir again with the whisk without incorporating too much air . Eggnog can be served cold, warm, or tepid; you can add a sprinkle of nutmeg on each glass before serving .
Eggnog can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended
This version of eggnog is cooked, similar to a custard, so it is much safer than the raw version. In some versions, egg whites whipped with sugar can be used to make a froth to place on the drink once finished. The amount of alcohol can be adjusted for a more or less alcoholic version, and brandy can be substituted with bourbon or cognac.
Powdered vanilla can be replaced with vanilla extract.
