instructions:
To prepare chocolate flames, let's start with the shortcrust pastry. In the planetary mixer, with the paddle attachment, cream the softened butter with the powdered sugar and acacia honey. Then add the egg yolk, a pinch of salt dissolved in a tiny bit of water, vanilla seeds, and grated lemon zest. Finally, add the sifted flour. Transfer the dough to the work surface and knead it briefly for a few moments, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest in the fridge for 2 hours. After the time has passed, roll it out to a thickness of about 1/8 inch (4 mm) with the rolling pin on a lightly floured surface and cut out about twenty discs of 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. Gradually place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake them in a preheated oven at 392°F (200°C) in static mode, for 6-7 minutes: they should be firm but not crunchy. While the cookies cool, prepare the ganache, bringing the fresh cream almost to a boil, then pour it over the chopped chocolate placed in a bowl and stir. As soon as it melts, add the softened butter in pieces and stir to combine everything. Once the butter is also incorporated, you can whip the ganache with an electric mixer until it is light and frothy. Transfer it to a pastry bag with a star nozzle and arrange it in tufts on the cookies. Place the filled cookies on a tray and let them set in the fridge for 3 hours and then in the freezer for 15 minutes. In these few minutes, chop the chocolate for the coating, melt it in a bain-marie, and bring it to room temperature. Then retrieve the flames, holding them by the base, dip them completely into the melted chocolate. Put them back on the tray and let them set in the fridge again for a bit, until the shell becomes crunchy. Your chocolate flames are ready: enjoy them!
Chocolate flames can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. If you want to freeze them, do so without the coating.
For a shinier result, you should coat your chocolate flames by tempering the chocolate. Follow our guide How to temper to learn more. If you want an alternative version, you can sprinkle the tips with still soft chocolate with coconut flakes or slightly toasted hazelnut or almond granules.
