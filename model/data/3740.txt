Soft, savory parcels make stuffed cabbage a real WIN for anyone craving simple comfort . Families gather around the table for these classic rolls—plump cabbage leaves loaded with a traditional beef and rice filling, then wrapped up tight in rich tomato sauce . The sauce not only keeps things moist and tender , but adds that familiar tang everyone expects from authentic Polish cabbage rolls . With its pretty shape and appetizing look, this dish stands out at family dinners and always goes over big at holiday gatherings. Its soft , mild inside and rich , tomatoey outside give every bite just the right amount of heartiness and taste—seriously, one of those meals the kids and grownups both want seconds of. Classic comfort food like this carries loads of flavor in every forkful (and trust me, leftovers taste GREAT too—most folks say the flavor gets even better the next day).

These hearty Polish cabbage rolls work any night, but also make a great choice when you need blankets of comfort on cold weekends or bring-along food for friends.

Since the rolls always hold together and serve up neat, folks find them pretty easy for potlucks or freezing ahead. Few crowd-pleasers tick as many boxes as this one...incredible comfort, classic taste, and straightforward family appeal, all thanks to the charm of good old stuffed cabbage . Great for family meals, holidays, or whenever you want something nice that tastes wonderful and still feels like home.
Lightly trim the base of the cabbage so it stands upright. Slowly open the leaves, trying not to break them; you only need a small space in which you will later put the filling. In a bowl, beat the egg with the wine, salt, and breadcrumbs; add the milk and ground meat and mix well.
Stuff the cabbage leaves with the meat. It is possible to tie the cabbage to prevent it from opening during cooking. Put the vegetable broth, bay leaf, pepper, and quartered onion in the pot. Place the cabbage inside the pot. Cook for half an hour from when the steam begins to escape. The cooking time with the pressure cooker depends on each type of pot. Check the cooking by inserting a knife in the center; the cabbage will be ready when it's tender inside. Take the cabbage out of the pot and keep it warm. Bring the sauce to a boil and reduce it by 1/4. Serve the cabbage hot, sliced and decorated with a spoonful of mayonnaise and the sauce.
If you find it too complicated to open the cabbage leaves (because they are too compact), you can try cutting it in half, hollowing it out a bit to create a hole to fill with the stuffing, then bring the two halves together and tie them with kitchen string.
