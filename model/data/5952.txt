instructions:
To prepare pan-fried sea bream fillets and potatoes , start by thoroughly washing the potatoes ; cut them into roughly 0.2 inch slices, without peeling . Place them in a bowl and season with salt , black pepper and oil.
Add the peeled garlic clove too, along with the thyme and rosemary sprigs . Place the potatoes in a large pan and cook on a medium to low flame for around 30 minutes. Try not to turn them over to avoid breaking them up: sauté them only. Clean the sea bream in the meantime. Gut and descale the fish using the special tool , or a knife, using the blunt side.
Place the sea bream on a cutting board and cut the first fillet using a knife . Turn the fish over and cut the other fillet out. Trim both fillets to remove the part under the belly .
Use special tweezers to remove any spines too . Once the potatoes are soft and have browned , place them in a container and leave them to one side .
Place a drizzle of oil in the same pan you used to cook the potatoes and place the sea bream fillets in the middle . Cook for around 10 minutes on a low flame and gently turn the fillets over half way into the cooking time . Add salt and pepper to taste .
Add the potatoes when the fillets are done . Heat them up and serve your pan-fried sea bream and potatoes !
Sea bream fillets are best enjoyed freshly prepared, although they can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
If you don't feel confident about filleting the fish then simply buy the fillets. You can also use frozen fillets, just defrost them before cooking.
