instructions:
To prepare the bacon wrapped dates, begin by cutting the scamorza cheese into pieces that aren't too large, allowing them to be enclosed by the dates.
Halve the dates lengthwise, ensuring the two halves remain attached by one edge.
Stuff each date with a piece of cheese and press lightly.
Wrap each date in a slice of bacon, rolling it up completely.
Place the bacon wrapped dates on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and cook in a preheated fan oven at 356°F (180°C) for approximately 8 minutes.
Once the bacon is golden, remove the dates from the oven and arrange them on a tray.
Garnish with a few drops of balsamic vinegar and some sesame seeds.
Serve the bacon wrapped dates immediately.
If there are any leftovers, store the bacon wrapped dates in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Reheat them briefly in the oven before enjoying.
If you don't have a fan oven, you can cook the dates for 10 minutes at 392°F (200°C) in static mode or in an air fryer at 356°F (180°C) for 8 minutes.
Substitute scamorza with another melting cheese like Emmental, Gruyere, or Gouda.
For garnish, use chopped hazelnuts, pistachios, or pecans instead of sesame seeds.
Replace balsamic vinegar with a drizzle of maple syrup or honey if desired.
