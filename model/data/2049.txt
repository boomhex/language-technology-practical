instructions:
To prepare the Sicilian sweet and sour pumpkin, take the red pumpkin, cut off the skin with a knife , then divide it in half and cut each half into slices 3/8 inch thick .
Place a pan on the heat, pour in the olive oil and heat it. When it reaches 340°F, the oil is ready for frying. Measure the oil temperature with a food thermometer for optimal cooking. Place the pumpkin slices in the oil and cook for about 4 minutes ; the pumpkin should be cooked but still quite firm. Use a slotted spoon to drain the pumpkin slices .
and place them on a tray . Meanwhile, wash and chop the mint leaves and finely slice the garlic .
Discard some of the oil used for frying and keep 5 oz in the pan , add the peeled and sliced garlic cloves , the sugar ,
and the white wine vinegar . Let the seasoning reduce over high heat for a few minutes, then turn off the heat . Now you can serve the pumpkin: arrange the pumpkin slices on a plate, salt them .
cover with the garlic and oil dressing , sprinkle with the chopped mint leaves , and serve your Sicilian sweet and sour pumpkin hot or warm .
The sweet and sour pumpkin can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, covered with plastic wrap. Freezing is not recommended.
Like every regional recipe, Sicilian sweet and sour pumpkin has different variations: some omit the mint or add raisins. How do you prepare it?
