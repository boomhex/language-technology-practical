To prepare the grilled gilthead bream fillets, start by marinating the fish: place the fillets in a bowl, add 1/4 cup of oil , salt, pepper , and the thyme leaves . Cover with plastic wrap and place everything in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes.
At this point, prepare the side dish by cutting half of the cherry tomatoes in half and leaving the others whole. Pour 2 teaspoons of oil in a pan and add a clove of garlic in its skin, but slightly crushed . Let it brown and add both the cherry tomatoes and the black olives .
Cook for 5 minutes on high heat, add half of the oregano , then remove the garlic clove and pour in 1/4 cup of water.
Cook for another 5 minutes , adjust salt and pepper, and turn off the heat . Meanwhile, grill the gilthead bream fillets: lightly grease a grill with the remaining oil (about 2 teaspoons) and heat it on the stove, only when it's very hot, place the gilthead bream fillets on it , wait about 7-8 minutes, then turn the fillets and finish cooking for another 7-8 minutes.
