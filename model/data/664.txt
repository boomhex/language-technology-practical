instructions:
To prepare the smothered cabbage, clean the cabbage by removing the more damaged outer leaves; you will obtain about 1.5 lbs. Wash it well under running water, then use a sharp knife to cut it in half and then finely chop it , discarding the harder central part. Peel and finely chop the onion .
Remove the casing from the sausages and crumble them with your hands . Also, peel the garlic clove .
Pour the oil into a large pan, add the chopped onion, garlic clove , and sauté well over the heat, then add the crumbled sausage and shredded cabbage, add the rosemary sprig, and season with salt and pepper .
Cover with the lid and cook over low heat for 1 hour, stirring occasionally . If the cabbage becomes too dry during cooking, you can add some hot vegetable broth. Once the smothered cabbage is well stewed, turn off the heat and serve it hot .
Smothered cabbage can be stored in the fridge for 3 days. You can freeze it after cooking if you used fresh ingredients.
If desired, a splash of vinegar can be added to give a slightly sweet and sour flavor. Instead of sausage, you can use diced pancetta or lard following the same recipe.
