Fresh beet pasta is a dish you find from northern Italy all the way down to Sardinia . And look, it’s easy to see why. This homemade beetroot pasta has a stunning, jewel-like amaranth color that really pops. The magic happens when you mix tender pre-cooked beetroot into the dough, along with eggs to keep it moist and elastic. Seriously good. This gives you a beet pasta dough perfect for everything—from classic lasagna sheets to soft ravioli, even rustic maltagliati. In Sardinia, people fill their beet-infused pasta—like Culurgiones—with potatoes and a zesty blue cheese sauce. And here's the thing, this creates a sweet and earthy burst of flavors in every bite. Across other regions, folks toss beet tagliatelle with fresh asparagus or bake it into savory tarts—pretty simple, right? Shows how versatile and fun this pasta can be. It’s amazing how beetroot can transform a basic pasta, not just with color but a subtle, sweet taste that brightens the dish and your table. The fresh beet pasta scene in Italy is all about playing with tradition. One day, it’s a beetroot pasta dish topped with butter and sage; the next, pink pasta with crumbled pecorino or a bright beet pesto. Even crispy beetroot bread and a moist beet cake aren’t off the table—people love this ingredient. Thing is, making pasta with beets is creative yet simple. Whether you go for simple shapes or get fancy with stuffed pasta, you’re enjoying a dish that’s lively and fresh, packed with gentle earthiness. No question. No matter which direction you take, each plate is a reminder of how Italian home cooks keep things interesting by experimenting with old favorites and bold, natural colors. I gotta say, it's all about finding joy in the kitchen and bringing some Italian flair to your table. For real.

Use a fork to start mixing the ingredients initially without taking additional flour , then gradually begin to gather more and more flour, and when the dough is sufficiently dry, continue by hand and knead until it is smooth and homogeneous, being careful not to tear it to avoid ruining the gluten structure. If necessary, add more flour as needed. Once a ball is formed , cover it and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. With a dough scraper, cut half of the dough . (You can keep the other half covered with plastic wrap so it doesn't dry out).
You can roll it out with a rolling pin or with a pasta machine to make the formats you prefer. We have prepared tagliatelle, rolling it with a rolling pin on a work surface sprinkled with semolina (or slightly floured). Roll out the dough as thinly as possible ; if you use the pasta roller, go to the penultimate thickness, sprinkle with semolina and let it dry for a few minutes. Even out the edges to create a rectangle .
Roll up the dough , cut strips about 1/4 inch thick , and form the classic nests .
You can freeze the fresh beetroot pasta while raw, in the various chosen formats.
For freezing, place the pasta formats well spaced on a tray and then place them in the freezer to harden for a couple of hours.
Once well hardened, put them in freezer bags and place them back in the freezer. They can be boiled directly from frozen.
If you want to use raw beetroot, you will first need to clean the beetroot well from soil residues: then you can peel it and blanch it or peel it and steam it, reducing it to chunks first, until completely softened.
