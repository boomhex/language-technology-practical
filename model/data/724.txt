instructions:
To prepare the spaghetti parmesan with cherry tomato coulis, first make the basil butter which will be used for creaming. Put a pot full of water on the fire, salt it at 10%, and bring it to a boil. Immerse the basil leaves , blanch them for 30 seconds then using a slotted spoon, drain them and transfer them to ice water . This step is to stop the cooking and keep the leaves’ color bright.
Wait a few seconds, then place the basil leaves in a strainer to remove excess water . Squeeze them lightly and pat the leaves with paper towels and transfer them to a mixer . Add the room temperature butter as well .
Blend everything until you get a smooth cream . Now transfer the mixture onto a sheet of parchment paper and spread it with a spatula until it forms a thin layer .
Try to obtain a regular shape . Place another sheet of parchment paper on top and close the edges well around the butter . Flatten further with a rolling pin and transfer to the refrigerator. The basil butter will solidify while you prepare the other components.
Now proceed to prepare the cherry tomato coulis. Pour the cherry tomatoes into a saucepan, add the oil , the basil leaves , and the sugar .
Add the salt and water . If you prefer, you can add a clove of garlic. Turn on the heat and let it cook for about 20 minutes, until they are soft but still firm .
Pass everything through a sieve , to collect the juice in a bowl . The coulis is ready: set aside and prepare the eggplants. Peel the onion and slice it , this will be used for cooking.
Trim the eggplants and peel them . Now cut them into regular cubes of about 3/8 inch . In a pan, pour 7 oz of oil, the onion , and the garlic sliced and with the core removed. Add a pinch of salt and let it soften.
Add the eggplants , mix well and salt again; this way the eggplants will release water and cook more easily. Let them stew for 10 minutes over medium heat. When the eggplants begin to caramelize, add the basil . Cook for another 5 minutes, add about 3 oz of coulis , mix, and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
Transfer the eggplants to the bowl of an immersion blender . Add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan , salt, and pepper. Blend everything until you get a coarse, rustic cream .
Cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water, for half the time indicated on the package . While the pasta cooks, take the butter from the fridge and cut it into cubes . Pour the remaining coulis into a large pan and transfer the spaghetti inside, taking them with tongs .
Add a little cooking water . Toss the spaghetti and when they are well mixed, add about 3 oz of basil butter . Mix well to cream .
Now plate. Place the eggplant cream on the base of the plate and lay the spaghetti on top. On one side put the grated Parmesan, on the other the grated Pecorino and finish with some basil leaves . Your spaghetti parmesan with tomato coulis is ready to be served!
The basil butter can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days. The eggplant cream and the coulis can also be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
The skin of the eggplants can be dried. You can then reduce it to powder and use it to decorate dishes. Use what is left of the basil butter to prepare a good risotto, to season vegetables, or fish, baked or steamed.
