instructions:
To prepare rice with spicy sautéed tofu, first put a pot of water on the stove to boil and salt it, then add the basmati rice and cook for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, clean and cut the eggplants into 1/2-inch cubes , then wash and halve the cherry tomatoes .
Sauté the eggplants with a drizzle of oil in a pan until they are nicely golden, then salt, pepper and set aside. At this point, the rice will be cooked, so drain and let it cool slightly.
Pour another drizzle of oil into the same pan, add the cherry tomatoes and sauté them for 5 minutes, then salt and combine them with the eggplants .
Now cut the tofu into 1/2-inch thick slices and slice the chili pepper into rings . Pour a drizzle of oil into another pan, add the rosemary sprig and the chili pepper and heat on low heat.
Place the tofu slices , increase the heat and sear them on both sides for a few minutes to make them golden and slightly crispy , then set aside. In the same pan, add another drizzle of oil and the rice .
Add the cooked vegetables and sauté everything for a couple of minutes , then turn off the heat and flavor with chives . Serve your rice with spicy sautéed tofu still warm !
Rice with spicy sautéed tofu can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
If you prefer, you can replace the chives with fresh mint leaves!
