To prepare yeast-free pancakes, first melt the butter and let it cool slightly. Separate the yolks from the whites . Add a pinch of salt to the egg whites, then whip them with an electric mixer and set aside. In the yolk bowl, add a pinch of baking soda and start mixing.
While the mixer is running, pour in the milk , the cooled melted butter , and the previously sifted flour .
Once you obtain a frothy and homogeneous mixture, gently fold in the egg whites with movements from bottom to top so as not to deflate it . Grease the crepe maker with a pat of butter and heat it well, then pour a ladle of batter trying to form a disc about 4 inches in diameter . Cook for 2-3 minutes until bubbles start to form on the surface , then flip the pancake and cook for another 2-3 minutes on the other side, until golden. You can cook multiple pancakes at once, making sure to space them out. Continue in this way until the batter is finished.
As the pancakes are cooked, stack them on a serving plate . Garnish with raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, and some fresh mint leaves, then drizzle with maple syrup . Your yeast-free pancakes are ready to be enjoyed !
Yeast-free pancakes should be consumed as soon as they are ready, while they are still soft and warm; if any are left over, you can store them in the refrigerator for 1-2 days, stacked and covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container.
If desired, you can flavor the batter with a pinch of cinnamon.
Cow's milk can be replaced with a plant-based milk of your choice.
