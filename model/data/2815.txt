instructions:
Pasta ai tre pesti is a real showstopper when it comes to pasta tricolore in Liguria. And look, this dish really takes the classic pesto alla genovese up a notch by blending not just one, but three creamy and colorful pestos. Imagine a golden beetroot pesto with its sweet flavor—so so tasty. Fresh marjoram gives it a pop of green and a wonderfully fresh smell, and then there's ricotta, which adds a tender, mild touch. Toss in some toasted pine nuts and a sprinkle of grated cheese , and you've got a pasta that's basically a party on the plate. And honestly, many folks use homemade basil from their gardens, which is great, enhancing the fresh taste and embracing the core of cucina italiana tradizionale. Plus, the dish looks fantastic—each plate ends up unique, thanks to the colorful swirls of sauces.
What’s great about this pasta ai tre pesti is how it lets you explore different flavors. The beetroot pesto is ideal if you crave a hint of sweetness and something a bit out of the ordinary in your pasta con pesto di barbabietola . Marjoram isn't a common choice for pasta, but it's super aromatic and pairs perfectly with the pine nuts and cheese—really, it does—especially in a pasta con pesto di maggiorana . Ricotta gives you that moist, velvety bite that makes everything feel lighter—just right for hot summer days when you want ricette estive leggere . This dish isn’t just tasty; it’s also a conversation starter due to the three distinct colors and flavors.
In Liguria, this is a popular choice for special lunches or whenever something more exciting than the usual pasta is desired. If you're a fan of pasta con pesti alternativi or enjoy primi piatti vegetariani , this dish checks all the boxes. And here's the thing—it brings together the best of everything: fresh herbs, delicious cheese, and those colorful, creamy sauces that make each bite a great surprise. Whether you're hosting a dinner or simply want to try something new, this pasta offers a fresh take on traditional flavors that everyone will enjoy. For sure.
To prepare the pasta with three pestos, start with the beetroot pesto: peel the beetroots, then cut them into slices about a quarter-inch thick . Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the beet slices so they do not overlap. Sprinkle them with salt to taste and chopped thyme , drizzle with a little oil, and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 30-35 minutes (or in a fan oven at 356°F for about 25-30 minutes). Once cooked , let the beetroots cool,
then transfer them to a blender with blades , add the grated cheese ; then squeeze some lemon juice , strain it
to add a few drops to the rest of the ingredients, along with the pine nuts and basil leaves . Then pour in the oil and blend everything with the immersion blender, pouring in the fresh liquid cream in a thin stream until you get a smooth cream.
Transfer the obtained pesto into a small bowl . Continue the preparation with the marjoram pesto: pick the marjoram leaves from the stems and place them in a tall container to blend them with the pine nuts ; add the oil ,
the grated salted ricotta and Tilsit , a pinch of salt, and blend everything with the immersion blender , then pour the obtained pesto into a small bowl .
Finally, move on to the cheese pesto: in the tall container, place the fresh ricotta , then add the half garlic clove , the pine nuts ,
the oil and a pinch of salt . Also add the grated pecorino and blend everything ,
until you get a homogeneous mixture . Bring water to a boil in a pot and cook the pasta until al dente , then drain it, keeping a little cooking water, and place it in a bowl .
Dress it with a bit of oil and divide it into three bowls to season each with the three different pestos (if necessary, add a little cooking water to make the pasta creamier). This way, you'll bring to the table the pasta with three pestos in a tricolor dish to taste each one !
You can store the pasta with three pestos in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap. You can store the three pestos in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 1-2 days. The three pestos can be frozen if you used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
Instead of marjoram, you can use arugula leaves, and instead of pine nuts, toasted almonds!
