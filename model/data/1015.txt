First, melt the butter in a saucepan (or in the microwave) and let it cool. Separate the yolks and whites of the 3 eggs . Start whipping the egg whites with a mixer .
When they are white and fluffy, add 1.5 tbsp of sugar and continue to beat for a few minutes . In another large bowl, place the 2 whole eggs and the 3 yolks separated earlier. Add the remaining 4/5 cup of sugar .
Add a pinch of salt and the seeds extracted from the vanilla bean . Work with electric whisks .
After about 10 minutes, you will get a fluffy and foamy mixture . Now incorporate some of the beaten egg whites , mixing from the bottom up with a spatula .
Then add some of the sifted flour , continue mixing with a spatula from the bottom up . Continue this way alternating egg whites and flour until you get a well-mixed homogeneous dough .
Take the melted butter, now cold, add two generous tablespoons of batter and mix vigorously to obtain a homogeneous mixture, similar in consistency to the dough . Pour back into the bowl .
Mix gently without deflating the mixture. Lightly grease (with vegetable oil or butter) a 14 x 11 inches pan and line it with parchment paper, making sure the edges adhere well. Pour the sponge cake batter inside and level it with a spatula .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 9 minutes, until it is lightly golden. Once ready, remove the pan from the oven and prepare a sheet of parchment paper on the work surface, sprinkle it abundantly with granulated sugar . Lift the sponge cake with the parchment paper and flip it onto the prepared sheet .
Gently remove the paper used for baking . With a serrated knife, trim the edges. Do not let the roll cool and quickly spread the strawberry jam over the entire surface . If you prefer, you can use a lot of jam for more filling.
Roll it up from the shorter side , tightening it , until you form your roll .
Wrap in parchment paper and refrigerate for an hour. After this time, take the roll, transfer it to a platter, sprinkle it with powdered sugar and serve it .
Store the jam roll for up to 3-4 days in the refrigerator, well covered. If you prefer, you can freeze it, even in slices, and thaw as needed.
For a tasty touch, you can spread a layer of mascarpone or ricotta on the surface before adding the jam and then rolling, as per the recipe. You can use these quantities for a larger baking pan (e.g., 16x13 inches): it will simply be thinner. Instead of butter, you can substitute with 2.5 tbsp of vegetable oil (sunflower, peanut). The butter helps make the dough softer and adds even more flavor. If you prefer not to use it, you can simply omit it.
