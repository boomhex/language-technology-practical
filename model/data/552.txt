instructions:
To prepare the Valentine's Day cheesecake, start with the base: melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat and let it cool. In a mixer, add the dry cookies and cocoa powder and blend until powdered . Pour the mixture into a bowl and add the melted butter .
Mix well with a spoon to combine the mixture . Line a 6.5-inch diameter (4-inch height) springform pan with parchment paper; for the edges, you can use a strip of acetate. Pour the cookie mixture and compact it with the back of a spoon to create a 3-inch high edge . Let it solidify in the fridge for at least 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the filling: soak 14 g of gelatin sheets in cold water . In a bowl, work the mascarpone with the cream cheese with a whisk, then add the powdered sugar . Also add the fresh liquid cream, keeping aside 2 tablespoons (30 g) to dissolve the gelatin . Continue to work with the whisk until the cream is semi-whipped: at this point, the mixture will be consistent, smooth, and shiny.
In a saucepan, pour the 2 tablespoons (30 g) of fresh liquid cream and bring it to a boil, then turn off the heat and add the previously soaked gelatin . Stir and let cool. Once cooled, add it to the mixture of cream, mascarpone, and cream cheese and mix.
Grate the tonka bean and mix again with the whisk . Meanwhile, the base will have solidified, so take it and pour the filling inside the shell. Level the cream and let it firm again in the fridge for at least 40 minutes.
Move on to the coulis: soak the gelatin in cold water. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, add the raspberries , water , and sugar .
Turn on the heat to medium intensity, stirring occasionally . When the raspberries have wilted, strain the mixture , then add the drained and squeezed gelatin . Stir.
When the cake is well set, cover the surface with the coulis, leaving aside about 1/4 cup (50 g) . Place the dessert in the fridge for about 10 minutes . Whip the remaining 1/3 cup (70 g) of fresh cream for decoration and pour it into a piping bag with an 18 mm plain nozzle. When the coulis has set, gently remove the cake from the mold and place it on the serving dish. Decorate with whipped cream dollops .
Garnish every other whipped cream dollop with a raspberry . On the remaining dollops, create a small cavity with a teaspoon and fill it with the leftover coulis . Decorate as desired with sprinkles and another grating of tonka bean. Your Valentine's Day cheesecake is ready to be served !
You can store the Valentine's Day cheesecake in the fridge for 2-3 days.
You can store the coulis for a couple of days in the fridge.
You can freeze the cheesecake, even in portions.
If you don't have tonka bean or don't like the sweet-almond aftertaste, you can omit it or replace it with your preferred flavor: vanilla bean seeds, cardamom, or grated lemon zest!
You can also use the same amount of cocoa cookies instead of plain ones.
