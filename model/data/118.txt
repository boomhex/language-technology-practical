instructions:
To prepare the seafood pasta and potatoes, first make the Vegetable broth and keep it warm. Start with the How to Clean and Open Mussels : remove the beard, scrape the shells well, and rinse them under running water . Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan with a clove of garlic, a parsley stalk, and a piece of chili pepper , then add the mussels .
Deglaze with white wine , then pour in cold water to create a more abundant base. Let the mussels open over high heat with the lid on, it will take about 5 minutes .
When they are all open, remove them from the heat and strain the cooking liquid , which you will set aside. Separate the mollusks from the shells , leaving some whole to decorate the dish at the end.
Cover the mussels with their water and set them aside . Move on to the potatoes: peel them and cut them into regular cubes , then place them in a bowl with cold water to prevent them from turning brown .
Finally, focus on cleaning the squid: remove the innards, skin, and beak, then rinse them well and cut the bodies into rings and the tentacles into pieces .
Prepare the sauté: finely chop onion, celery, and carrot , and halve the cherry tomatoes . Heat an abundant drizzle of oil in a large saucepan, then add the onion .
Also add the chopped celery and carrot . Salt immediately and flavor with a bay leaf , then let it sauté for a few minutes. When the vegetables are soft, add the cherry tomatoes .
Cook over high heat for about 5 minutes, to slightly wilt them . At this point, add the drained potatoes and mix them well with the sauté to flavor them. Add the hot vegetable broth .
Salt and pepper , then let it cook for 10 minutes, until the potatoes start to soften. Meanwhile, in a separate pan, heat a drizzle of oil with a clove of garlic and add the squid, sautéing them over high heat . Deglaze with white wine and let it evaporate.
When a nice crust has formed, salt and pepper . Now add the pasta directly to the saucepan and cook for 10 minutes over low heat, stirring often, as you would with a risotto. Halfway through cooking, add the filtered mussel water .
Also add the squid , mix and pour more water if needed. When there are 2 minutes left before the end of cooking, add the shelled mussels and gently stir, letting it simmer to thoroughly blend all the flavors .
Meanwhile, cut the smoked scamorza into cubes . When the pasta is ready, remove it from the heat, season with chili powder and plenty of chopped parsley .
Add the scamorza and a sprinkle of grated Parmigiano Reggiano , then mix well until the cheeses melt and the texture becomes thick and velvety.
Plate the seafood pasta and potatoes , finishing each portion with a few whole mussels for decoration and a fresh basil leaf to scent the dish .
We recommend consuming the seafood pasta and potatoes immediately.
As an alternative to mixed pasta, you can use other shapes like tubetti or ditalini, which are well-suited for creamy pasta preparations.
