instructions:
To prepare the soft sweet rolls, first melt the butter and let it cool. Ensure that all other ingredients are at room temperature and start making the dough. In a bowl, pour the milk, water, and melted butter . Stir briefly, then add the egg and the egg yolk .
Mix with a whisk and also add the sugar and crumbled yeast .
Also add part of the flour and mix with a whisk or spatula . Continue like this, adding the flour little by little .
Finally, add a pinch of salt . When the dough has formed, start kneading by hand , first in the bowl and then on the work surface , until it is smooth and homogeneous. This will take about 5 minutes.
Form a ball , place it in a bowl, and cover with plastic wrap or a plate. Let it rise for two and a half hours until it has doubled in volume .
At this point, sprinkle the work surface with flour and transfer the dough onto it. Flatten it first with your hands and then roll it out with a rolling pin , until you get a rectangle about half a centimeter thick . Brush the entire surface with melted butter .
Now, using a pastry cutter and a ruler, cut strips about 2 cm wide . Roll each strip to form a roll .
Transfer the rolls one by one onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper , cover with another tray and let rise for another 45 minutes. After this time, brush the surface with beaten egg yolk and cream .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 25 minutes. When they are nicely golden, remove your soft sweet rolls from the oven , let them cool slightly, and dust with powdered sugar before serving them .
The rolls can be stored for one day in a food bag. You can also freeze them once they are baked and cooled.
The dough can be flavored with cinnamon powder, vanilla, or lemon zest. You can make it even more delicious by adding dark chocolate chips or a layer of custard before rolling the rolls.
