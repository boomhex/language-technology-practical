instructions:
To prepare the eggless savory muffins, first chop the rosemary along with the marjoram and coarsely chop the chorizo or another type of spicy salami . Pour the flour into a large bowl, add the instant yeast
and the grated Grana Padano cheese and mix with a whisk. Pour in the milk slowly while continuing to whisk and do the same with the oil .
When the liquids are well incorporated into the mixture, add the salami , the chopped herbs , the goat cheese
and the salt and mix again to combine everything well. Grease a 12-muffin mold with vegetable oil and fill the molds equally until the batter is used up .
After filling all the molds , bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 30 minutes. Once cooked, take your eggless savory muffins out of the oven and let them cool slightly before unmolding and serving !
The eggless savory muffins can be kept at room temperature for up to 2 days, in a paper bag or a container. You can freeze them after baking and completely cooling them.
Vary the flavor of your eggless muffins using ingredients such as olives, capers, sun-dried tomatoes, lemon zest, or another type of Cheese Muffins .
