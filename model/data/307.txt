To prepare the risotto with stracchino, broccoli, and anchovies, first clean the broccoli, take 4 larger florets, totaling about 100 grams (3.5 oz) and divide in half . Add the green leaves to the florets .
Blanch for 4 minutes , drain , and cool in a bowl with ice water , drain again and set aside.
Meanwhile, divide the remaining broccoli into florets; then peel the stem and cut it into pieces. Blanch the remaining broccoli for 10 minutes and cool them in ice water. Drain , transfer everything into a tall container, and season with oil .
Adjust the salt and blend with an immersion blender until you obtain a creamy and homogeneous mixture and set aside.
In a pan, heat oil and garlic, then add the previously blanched broccoli florets and leaves . Adjust the salt , add the chili pepper slices , and sauté for a few minutes, then set aside.
In a pot, heat a tablespoon of oil, add the rice , and toast it while stirring often. Pour hot water or hot vegetable broth to cover it. Cook the rice by adding more liquid as needed. When the rice is cooked, turn off the heat and add the stracchino .
Adjust the salt and pepper , pour a drizzle of oil , and mix. Plate the rice and place a spoonful of broccoli cream in the center .
Place the sautéed broccoli florets and leaves on the cream . Complete with anchovy fillets . The risotto with stracchino, broccoli, and anchovies is ready to be served .
The risotto with stracchino, broccoli, and anchovies should be consumed immediately, but if there are leftovers, you can store it in the refrigerator in a closed container for 1-2 days.
For a milder taste or to adapt it for those who don't like fish, you can omit the anchovies and add a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese or some chopped walnuts for a crunchy touch. For a stronger flavor, replace the stracchino with mild gorgonzola.
