Start preparing the Victoria sandwich by placing the softened butter, sugar, and seeds from a vanilla pod in a bowl , then beat with an electric mixer until you get a light and fluffy mixture. Add the room temperature eggs one at a time, beating with the mixer and allowing the first egg to be fully absorbed before adding the next. Once you have a nice smooth cream , blend in with a spoon the previously mixed and sifted flour and baking powder along with a pinch of salt.
Alternating with the addition of milk . Mix the ingredients well and then pour them equally into two greased and floured cake pans with a diameter of 9 inches. Level the batter in the two pans and then bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes.
When the two bases are baked , remove them from the oven and let them cool completely. Prepare the cream filling for the Victoria sandwich by combining mascarpone and Philadelphia cheese in a bowl ; mix the two fresh cheeses well to soften them by adding a few drops of vanilla extract and the sifted powdered sugar .
Place one of the cakes on a serving plate, cover it with the cream of fresh cheeses then sprinkle the surface with raspberry jam , place fresh raspberries on top and cover everything with the other cake , just like a sandwich! Sprinkle the surface of the Victoria sandwich with powdered sugar and serve this delight immediately! Store the Victoria sandwich in the refrigerator in a container with a lid.
