instructions:
To prepare the carrots with mustard, first wash the carrots well. Then trim them and peel them . Using a serrated blade, cut the carrots into slices, making a diagonal cut .

the oil , a pinch of salt , and a teaspoon of sugar .
Add the 2 garlic cloves , the bay leaves, and 2 sprigs of parsley . Bring to a boil, then add the carrots and let them cook over medium heat for about 15-20 minutes. They should be soft but firm.
At this point, use a sieve to drain the carrots and transfer them to a bowl . Let the cooking liquid reduce for another 10 minutes over high heat, then filter it ,
to remove the garlic and herbs . Let it cool, then add the mustard and mix to combine the ingredients .
Transfer the carrots to a serving dish, trying not to overlap them. Dress with the mustard sauce and add chopped parsley on top . The carrots are ready to serve !
