Stroncatura calabrese is this really rustic pasta from Calabria, in southern Italy, where bold, honest flavors pretty much rule. This traditional Italian recipe uses a special whole-wheat pasta with a porous texture—perfect for soaking up sauce. Seriously good. The anchovies melt into hot olive oil, giving the dish a deep, salty kick that blends perfectly with the sweet and juicy cherry tomatoes . And listen, adding in some olives—especially those slightly bitter Taggiasca ones—creates a mix of salty, briny and a bit tangy all at once. What really makes this dish shine is the golden pangrattato, or toasted breadcrumbs, sprinkled on top. This adds a crispy contrast that complements the Mediterranean vibe and those classic Calabrian flavors.
In Calabria, simple foods that pack a punch are the norm, and stroncatura calabrese is no exception. It's a staple at family tables, often served alongside local favorites like cuddrurieddri or a spicy slice of 'nduja. And the sauce?
