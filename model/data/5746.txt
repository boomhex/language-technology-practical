instructions:
To make the avocado toast, start with the avocado cream: cut the avocado in half and remove the pit , then scoop out the pulp and transfer it to a bowl. Add the lemon juice to prevent it from browning .
Mash the avocado with a fork until it becomes a cream , then adjust with salt and pepper. Cover with cling film in contact and store in the fridge until use .
Move on to the bread: heat a drizzle of oil in a pan , then place the slices of bread and toast them on both sides. Set aside .
Now prepare the poached eggs: pour water into a pot, add the vinegar and heat until it boils. Lower the flame and create a vortex with a spoon , then gently slide in an egg that you have cracked into a separate bowl . Cook for 3-4 minutes, without touching it.
Once the egg white has coagulated around the yolk, drain the poached egg with a slotted spoon and transfer it onto a tray. Proceed in the same way with all the other eggs . You are ready to assemble your toast: spread the slices of bread with the avocado cream .
Add a slice of smoked salmon and lay the poached egg on top, being careful not to break it . Finally, garnish with a few thyme leaves, a drizzle of oil, and some grated lemon zest: your avocado toast is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the avocado toast immediately.
As an alternative to slices of homemade bread, you can use Brioche bread or Loaf Bread , including Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread .
If you want, you can add a spicy note with fresh chili pepper or Tabasco!
If you don't have avocado, try replacing it with a delicious Zucchini Guacamole !
