The potatoes, cut into wedges or slices, absorb the cooking juices becoming tender, while the black olives introduce a savory touch.

To prepare cod with potatoes and olives, first focus on the fish. We used pre-desalted cod, ready to be cooked, but if you prefer, you can use salt cod or dried stockfish, being careful to soak them in cold water for a couple of days, changing the water at least 3 times a day, to remove the salt (in the case of salt cod) and to rehydrate (in the case of stockfish). Then drain the cod well, pat it dry with a clean cloth, cut it into chunks , then coat it in flour making sure to flour both sides thoroughly. Slice the onion thinly .
In a pot, pour 2 and a half tablespoons of oil, add the onion and sauté for 5 minutes. Then add the floured cod and brown it over medium heat for 5 minutes, turning the pieces on both sides .
Peel the potatoes and cut them into 12 wedges . In a large pan, pour 2 and a half tablespoons of oil and add the potatoes .
Add the vegetable broth , cover with a lid , and cook over high heat for 10 minutes. Then add the cod with its cooking juices to the pan .
Add the olives and bay leaf . Cover with a lid and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. The cod should not dry out too much, so if necessary, add water or vegetable broth.
Plate the dish by placing the potatoes and olives at the bottom , then lay the cod on top of the potatoes . Your cod with potatoes and olives is ready to be enjoyed !
Cod with potatoes and olives can be stored in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for up to 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of vegetable broth, you can use fish stock. You can enrich the dish by adding fresh tomatoes cut in half or tomato sauce when adding the cod to the potatoes. For an even more intense flavor, you can add Taggiasca olives and capers.
