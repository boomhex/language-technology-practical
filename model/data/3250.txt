If you’re looking to bring some Northern Italian charm to your table, Schiacciate con torretta di verdure e fonduta is really the way to go. It’s such a colorful and fun dish, perfect if you're into veggies and cheese. In Valle d’Aosta —where they really know their appetizers—this grilled vegetable dish truly stands out. Picture layers of tender zucchini, golden eggplant, and sweet bell peppers stacked into a tower. Oh, and filled with cubes of Emmentaler . So cheesy, right? Add a sprinkle of black pepper and finish it with a creamy fondue made from the region's famous fontina cheese. It's a rich, melty top that just pulls everything together. Honestly, this vegetable tower recipe isn’t just for vegetarians. Anyone who loves a mix of crunchy, soft, and gooey textures will be all over this.
And here’s the thing, what makes this dish so special during aperitivo time in Italy is its originality. I mean, while cured meats and breads are common, a vegetable stack with cheese is a refreshing change. It's colorful, moist from the cheese, and just the right size for hand-held enjoyment. The textural contrast? Really, really good. You’ve got the crispy edges from the grilled veggies, the soft middle with Emmentaler, and the silky smoothness of the fontina fondue melting on top. It's the kind of snack folks just can’t resist at a party, looking fancy with minimal effort.
With its Italian vegetable dish roots, it's super simple to assemble. Plus, all those layers make it perfect for any gathering—especially if you want something that feels special yet easygoing. You can mix and match the veggies depending on what's in season, so every batch has its own twist. For anyone searching for a layered vegetable recipe that's quick, tasty, and a bit different, this Valle d’Aosta specialty is a definite winner. Plus, it’s a fantastic way to showcase the flavors of Northern Italy, offering a satisfying bite that’s both unique and familiar. So, so good!
To prepare the flatbreads with vegetable tower and fondue, start by preparing the fondue: cut the fontina into coarse cubes (1-2) and put it in a saucepan with the cream . Let it cook over low heat until the ingredients are well combined.
While the fondue is cooking, wash and slice the zucchini and eggplant into fairly thick slices using a mandoline. Then wash the pepper and cut it into quarters, removing the seeds, stem, and white internal filaments .
Grill the vegetables one by one on a non-stick pan (7-8-9) so that they are well browned on both sides.
Once all the vegetables are ready, cut them into squares about 1 inch on each side and do the same with the Emmental slices . We are ready to compose the vegetable tower: take 12 flatbreads and on each place a square of eggplant, then a slice of cheese ,
continue with a square of pepper , another slice of cheese, and finish with a square of zucchini . Reheat the fondue and season it with pepper, then place a spoonful of it on each flatbread and complete with a grind of black pepper. Here are your flatbreads with vegetable tower and fondue ready!
It would be preferable to eat the flatbreads immediately, at most store them in the refrigerator for one day.
If you prefer, instead of putting Emmental, you can use another type of cheese such as provolone or the same fontina. If you have leftover grilled vegetables, season them with a little oil, salt, and pepper, and serve them as they are!
