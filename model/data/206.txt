instructions:
To prepare the gratinated sea bass fillets, first put a pot of slightly salted water on the stove. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and slice them with a mandoline : you should get very thin slices . Blanch the potato slices for 5 minutes , then drain and set aside.
In the meantime, prepare the breading: put the chopped parsley in a bowl, then add the grated Parmesan cheese , salt , and breadcrumbs .
Add the crushed garlic clove , grated lemon zest, and oil . Mix the mixture well .
Now line a baking sheet with parchment paper and form a layer of potatoes, slightly overlapping them , then place the sea bass fillets on top with the skin side down . Finally, cover the fish completely with the breading, pressing it with the back of a spoon to make it adhere .
Drizzle with oil and bake in a preheated fan oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes, or until golden brown; if necessary, you can turn on the grill during the last 5 minutes . Once out of the oven, your gratinated sea bass fillets are ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the gratinated sea bass fillets as soon as they are ready. If necessary, they can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day, in an airtight container.
You can add chopped almonds to the breading for an even crunchier touch!
