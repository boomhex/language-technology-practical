instructions:
To prepare the Catalan-style octopus, start by submerging the octopus in a large pot filled with cold water . Add a few bay leaves and a handful of black peppercorns : these aromas will give fragrance and character to the cooking. Turn on the heat, bring to a boil, then lower the flame, cover with a lid and let it cook gently for about an hour until the octopus is just tender enough.
Meanwhile, focus on the vegetables. Peel the carrots, cut them in half lengthwise, then slice them into half-moons . Trim and thinly slice the spring onion . Halve the cherry tomatoes .
Cut the avocado in half, remove the pit, then slice it . Peel the celery , cut it in half lengthwise, and slice it .
When the octopus is cooked, drain and let it cool . Cut the octopus into regular pieces . Transfer the octopus pieces and spring onion into a bowl .
Add all the other ingredients: the celery, the carrots , the cherry tomatoes, the avocado , and the Taggiasca olives .
Also add the arugula and dress with oil and orange juice .
Salt, pepper, and season with paprika . Mix well to flavor and serve your Catalan-style octopus immediately !
We recommend consuming the Catalan-style octopus as soon as it's ready.
You can store it in the refrigerator for up to one day without dressing.
If you can't find avocado or don't particularly like it, you can replace it with boiled potatoes cut into cubes.
Instead of Taggiasca olives, you can use sweet green olives or Gaeta black olives.
The vegetable scraps can be used to make homemade vegetable broth!
