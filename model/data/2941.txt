Sfoglie classiche from Trentino-Alto Adige bring such a special touch to any gathering, especially when topped with crema al parmigiano and filetti di speck . The puff pastry layers bake up crispy and golden, giving a satisfying crunch. Really good stuff. And the Parmesan cream? It's rich and smooth. The speck affumicato —thinly sliced from Northern Italy—adds a savory and slightly smoky kick that sets this dish apart from everyday snacks. It's the kind of finger food that's perfect as an antipasto sfizioso before a hearty dinner, but to be honest, people are happy to eat these anytime. The mix of salty, cheesy, and tender flavors makes them hard to resist. Really, they pair beautifully with a nice glass of red wine—whether you choose something bold or on the lighter side.
For those who enjoy experimenting in the kitchen, playing around with the cheese for the crema al parmigiano can be fun. Swapping a bit of Parmesan for Pecorino gives a stronger, sharper flavor that some in Trentino swear by. Different towns might use slightly different cheeses, or even make mini versions of these sfoglie classiche to serve as quick stuzzichini salati . The best part? These are easy to pick up and eat, making them a real crowd-pleaser at casual gatherings or any kind of aperitivo italiano. Seriously good. The moist, creamy cheese filling pairs perfectly with the crispy pastry and tender speck, making them almost way way better than other snacks. It's smart to have a few on hand when friends stop by because they tend to disappear fast! There's something super satisfying about that mix of textures and flavors that only happens with Northern Italian classics like this—simple, tasty, and always a hit. Plus, they showcase the rich culinary tradition of the region, where speck and Parmigiano are staples. Really authentic, really tasty. So, next time you need a go-to appetizer, these sfoglie classiche are sure to impress.
To prepare the classic puff pastries with parmesan cream and speck strips, start with the cream (you can also check the method here: Parmigiano Cream ). In a small pot, melt the butter , and once melted, add the flour gradually ; stir with a whisk and when the roux is formed, add the milk , previously heated. Continue stirring with the whisk.
Cook the mixture on low heat until it thickens. Remove the pot from the heat and gradually add the grated Parmesan Reggiano . Mix the Parmesan well with the béchamel: the consistency of the cream should be such that, if lifted with a spoon, it remains on the surface for a while before sinking . Now that the Parmesan cream is ready, take the thick slices of speck and cut them into strips a few millimeters thick. Then moisten two teaspoons (this way it will be easier to place the cream on the puff pastries).
Then you can assemble your pastries: use one teaspoon to take a bit of cream, shape it with the other teaspoon , then place the dollop of Parmesan cream, and add the speck strips crossed on each puff pastry . You can thus serve your classic puff pastries with Parmesan cream and speck strips !
The classic puff pastries with Parmesan cream and speck can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days in an airtight container. If there is leftover Parmesan cream, it can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, covered with plastic wrap.
If the Parmesan cream doesn't thicken, you can add 10-20 grams more flour. You can substitute part of the Parmesan with pecorino to give a more pronounced taste to the cream.
