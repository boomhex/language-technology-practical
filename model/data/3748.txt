To make the gratin rigatoni with mortadella stars, prepare the bechamel sauce following our Béchamel sauce . Put the butter in a small pot, flavor with nutmeg let the butter melt and add the sifted flour cooking it all for a few minutes, stirring constantly with a whisk. You should obtain a compact and dry mixture (roux); at this point, remove the pot from the heat and add the hot milk to the roux, stirring everything with a wooden spoon. Then put the pot back on the heat, cook on low flame until the sauce has thickened .
Transfer the bechamel into a bowl, add the pepper, grated cheese, and Pecorino cheese and mix with a spatula to blend the sauce and let it cool. Cut the mortadella into slices with a thickness of about 1/8 inch and with a small star-shaped cookie cutter, cut out many stars (if you don't have a star cutter, cut the mortadella into cubes or strips).
Add the stars to the bechamel and set the sauce aside. Place a pot with plenty of salted water on the stove, bring it to a boil and pour in the rigatoni , cook the pasta until very al dente, then drain it ;
Mix it with the bechamel and transfer it into a buttered ovenproof dish, top with a few knobs of butter and a tablespoon of grated cheese . Cook the pasta in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 15 minutes and then broil for two minutes to form a golden crust on the surface. Once cooked, remove the gratin rigatoni with mortadella stars from the oven, let them rest for 5 minutes, and then serve them .
