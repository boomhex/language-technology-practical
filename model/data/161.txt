instructions:
To prepare Messina-style calamari, first focus on cleaning the calamari. Separate the tentacles and eyes from the mantle , remove the cartilage pen found inside . Rinse under running water and use your hands to remove the innards. With a knife, cut into the end of the mantle and remove the outer skin .
Cut the mantle into rings about 1 inch thick . Finely chop the garlic and chili pepper . In a pot, heat a drizzle of oil, then add the garlic and chili and sauté for a few minutes.
Add the parsley stems , anchovies , previously desalted, and melt them over low heat. At this point, add the calamari and brown them for about 5 minutes until all the water they release during cooking evaporates.
Deglaze with white wine and let the alcohol evaporate completely. Add the peeled tomatoes , and season with salt and pepper .
Cover with a lid and cook over medium heat for about 20 minutes or until the calamari become tender. If the sauce is too watery, reduce it a bit by continuing to cook for a few more minutes. Remove from heat, discard the parsley stems, add the chopped parsley , and stir. Plate and garnish with more chopped parsley. Your Messina-style calamari are ready to be enjoyed .
Messina-style calamari should be consumed immediately; however, if you have leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator in a closed container for up to 1-2 days.
You can enrich the dish with black olives or capers, or add a sprinkle of toasted breadcrumbs at the end of cooking for a rustic and crunchy note.
