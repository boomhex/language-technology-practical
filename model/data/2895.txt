To make the coffee cream with almond biscuit, start by preparing the coffee with the moka pot: fill the boiler with cold water, preferably low in limestone, up to the safety valve (otherwise you will get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee and level with each teaspoon of coffee added by tapping the filter on the table with decisive movements , until you reach the edge of the filter.
Do not press with the teaspoon, nor make holes, and screw the coffee maker tightly (to prevent coffee from spilling out the sides while it rises), then place it on a low and steady flame to obtain a full-bodied coffee. As the coffee rises, a dense froth will form ; we recommend not letting the coffee gurgle for too long to keep its aroma and sweetness intact. Then turn off the heat, and your coffee for the preparation is ready: stir it directly in the moka pot with a teaspoon to make it more homogeneous .
Let the coffee cool and start preparing the biscuit: grate the zest of an orange and set it aside. In a bowl, pour the chopped almonds , add the sifted powdered sugar , flavor with the grated orange zest and a teaspoon of honey, and finally add an egg white and a pinch of salt.
At this point, mix the mixture with a spoon until you get a compact and well-mixed dough . Place a sheet of parchment paper on a pastry board, transfer the dough onto the sheet with a spoon
and spread it out into a rectangular shape of about 7 x 10 inches . Transfer the biscuit base into a slightly larger rectangular baking pan and bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 15 minutes (or in a fan oven at 320°F for about 10 minutes). When the surface of the biscuit is golden, remove it from the oven and let it cool .
Now take care of the cream: start by soaking the gelatin sheet in cold water for 5-10 minutes . While the gelatin softens, pour the fresh cream and milk into a saucepan, add the previously prepared moka coffee , and let it almost reach boiling point, meanwhile beat the eggs with sugar in a bowl
until you create a homogeneous mixture . Then turn off the heat, drain the gelatin, squeeze it, and add it to the hot mixture . Stir with a whisk to dissolve the gelatin better and add the eggs with sugar .
Mix well with the whisk to combine the mixture and finally add a pinch of salt. Then divide the obtained cream into 6 single-serving molds with a capacity of ½ cup each and let the cream set in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. After this time, take the now cold biscuit base and cut out 6 discs with a round cutter with a diameter of 3 inches .
At this point, you can assemble your dessert: remove the creams from the refrigerator, place a biscuit on the surface of the cream and unmold the dessert, to facilitate this operation, dip it for a few moments in a bowl containing hot water and then turn it onto a serving dish . Finally, garnish the dessert with a coffee-flavored ganache; to make it, follow the recipe for the Ganache cream by adding the moka coffee to the preparation, once ready, transfer it to a piping bag with a narrow nozzle to create striped patterns on the surface . Your coffee cream with almond biscuit is ready to be enjoyed!
You can store the coffee cream for 3 days in the refrigerator well covered with plastic wrap. You can also freeze it and then let it thaw in the refrigerator.
The coffee cream can also be used as a filling cream for cream puffs, tartlets, small pastries, or cakes. For the biscuit base, you can also use cocoa by substituting part of the almond flour to obtain an even richer taste.
