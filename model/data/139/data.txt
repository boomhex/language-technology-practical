Risotto with turnip tops is a classic dish that really shows off the best of Puglia. Here's the deal: it starts with cime di rapa , or broccoli rabe, simmered into a tender sauce. Honestly, it offers a slightly bitter taste that's kinda unique for a vegetable risotto . This earthy bitterness makes way for the salty goodness of anchovy risotto —those anchovies just melt right in, infusing each bite with a deep, savory flavor that totally reminds you of the Bari coast. And the sauce? A creamy garlic sauce that ties everything together without stealing the show. Pretty much. A sprinkle of crumbled taralli on top gives it a crispy finish—keeps every bite super super interesting and textured.
As the weather cools down, this dish becomes a comforting favorite. Seriously good. A bowl of risotto with turnip tops is perfect for a big family meal or a cozy dinner with friends. It's really about the harmony between bold, salty anchovies and the fresh bite of cime di rapa, a combo that’s celebrated in southern Italy.
Garlic sauce risotto like this isn't dominated by just one flavor—it’s how everything works together. In Puglia, you’ll find other cime di rapa dishes, like rice salad with Ragusano cheese or pasta with nduja and stracciatella, but this garlic sauce risotto —which is awesome—stands out with its moist and velvety texture. The flavors are bold yet, really really good, giving you a taste of Apulian tradition with every bite.
For those who dig Italian risotto recipes with a twist, this dish is a prime example of how simplicity can be packed with character, making it a real crowd-pleaser when it gets cold. Whether you’re familiar with Puglian cuisine or trying it for the first time, this recipe offers a tasty experience that shows off the rich culinary heritage of southern Italy. Can't go wrong.
