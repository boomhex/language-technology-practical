Trout en papillote is such a delightful way to savor a healthy meal without a ton of effort. Really, it’s so good. In Northern Italy, they call this method "cartoccio," and it's super popular for being both simple and delicious. You just wrap everything in parchment paper, toss it in the oven, and let it do its thing. And the result? The baked trout recipe comes out moist and tender, soaking up all those flavors from the veggies, herbs, and sweet sun-dried tomatoes tucked inside. Seriously, when you open that parcel, the aroma? Incredible. It’s got those mountain herb scents and the juicy trout aroma. Italians love to use whatever fresh veggies they have on hand, making it light yet really really satisfying. Using trout in parchment paper instead of foil gives it that traditional vibe—looks awesome on the table too.

To prepare the baked trout in foil, first cut the vegetables that will be used to stuff the trout: wash and peel the carrots, then cut them in half and cut each half lengthwise; cut the carrot quarters first into slices and then into thin sticks .
Now wash the green onion, remove the base with the roots , and cut it in half , then cut each half into thin sticks .
Wash and peel the potatoes, and also cut them first into slices and then into sticks of the same thickness as the carrots . Finally, dry the sun-dried tomatoes from the preserving oil and cut them into strips .
Transfer the carrots, potatoes, and green onion into a bowl, add a peeled garlic clove , and season with extra virgin olive oil , salt, and pepper to taste; then add the sun-dried tomatoes, mix well, and let rest so the vegetables absorb the flavors .
In the meantime, proceed with preparing the fish: rinse the already gutted trout under cold running water and dry them with a kitchen towel, then remove the scales using a scaler or the back of a knife and finally cut the fins . For more information, consult the guide How to Clean Salmon Trout .
Place the trout on a sheet of parchment paper and fill the belly of the fish with the vegetables you set aside, using a spoon . Transfer the trout with the parchment paper onto a sheet of aluminum foil , season with extra virgin olive oil
and carefully close the foil package, sealing the ends of both the aluminum and the parchment paper . Place the foil-wrapped trout on a baking sheet and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 35-40 minutes. Once the cooking time is finished, remove the trout from the oven and serve directly in the foil to best preserve the aroma: your baked trout in foil is ready to be enjoyed !
Serve the baked trout in foil immediately; if necessary, it can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of one day in a hermetically sealed container.
Freezing is not recommended.
You can further flavor the filling by adding herbs such as thyme or basil. You could also add a splash of color by placing whole cherry tomatoes inside the foil package!
