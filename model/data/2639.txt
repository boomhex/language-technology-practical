To make the phyllo baskets with salmon and zucchini cream, cut 3 sheets of phyllo dough measuring 9.5X13.5 inches into 4 parts to obtain 4 rectangles . On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, place 4 aluminum molds upside down, grease the bottom and sides with melted butter , and place a square of phyllo dough on top , moisten it with water
place another square on top , the corners should not overlap to create an asymmetrical pattern. Brush the dough again with melted butter and cover with another aluminum mold , this way the dough will hold its shape.
Bake the baskets in a preheated static oven at 374°F for 4 minutes (if using a fan oven, bake at 338°F for about a couple of minutes). Remove the baskets from the oven and let them cool slightly, then remove the aluminum molds . Peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes , boil them in water for a few minutes , then drain them, saving one tablespoon
place the rest in a baking dish with a drizzle of olive oil and cook for 10 minutes or until golden (alternatively, you can sauté them in a pan with a drizzle of oil). Wash and trim the zucchini and cut them into thin wedges , place them in a small pot with a drizzle of oil
also add the tablespoon of potatoes set aside and sauté for a few seconds, then cover with water , bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Drain the vegetables into a tall glass
blend them with an immersion blender while slowly adding olive oil until you get a cream to set aside. Prepare the salmon fillet: remove the bones with a special tweezers , then remove the skin by separating the flesh with a thin knife ,
cut the salmon into cubes and heat a drizzle of oil in a pan, then sauté the salmon cubes for a few minutes , season with salt, pepper, and thyme leaves, then turn off the heat and add the roasted potatoes (or cooked in the pan).
Assemble the baskets: place the baskets on a serving plate and fill with a spoonful of zucchini cream (if you like, you can use a piping bag) and also add the salmon and potato cubes . For garnish, decorate the phyllo baskets with salmon and zucchini cream with sprigs of thyme .
Store the phyllo baskets in the refrigerator for up to one day; you can freeze the zucchini cream and cooked salmon and potato cubes separately. Freezing phyllo dough is not recommended if it has already been frozen.
The best cut to use for this recipe is the upper part of the fillet, which is meatier and more compact.
