Those grooves? They hold the creamy sauce just perfectly.
The sauce—oh, it's good—blends asparagus stalks into a smooth texture with a burst of green flavor, but not too strong. Sheep’s milk ricotta adds a touch of sweetness and gives it a richer taste, way better than regular cow’s milk varieties. Italians, they love using seasonal ingredients in such simple yet flavorful ways.
