instructions:
To prepare the thepla, start with the basic dough. In a bowl, pour in the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, and chickpea flour. Add the salt, chili pepper, turmeric, fenugreek, and finally the cumin. Mix and gradually pour in the water, then the yogurt, the extra virgin olive oil, and continue to blend. Add the boiled, squeezed, and chopped spinach to the dough; continue to work for 4-5 minutes until you have obtained a compact ball. Now take 3 oz, place it on a lightly floured work surface, and roll it out with a rolling pin until you obtain a disk about 4 inches in diameter, and do the same for the others. Now heat a non-stick pan and cook the first thepla, brushing the upper side with olive oil before turning and cooking the other side. Your theplas are ready, just accompany them with small bowls of mango chutney and hummus or a yogurt sauce that we explain in the tip.
It is recommended to consume the thepla disks immediately.
Spiciness can be a hit or miss, prepare this quick yogurt sauce for both lovers and non-lovers! Mix 3.5 oz of Greek yogurt with 1 tablespoon of oil, a pinch of salt and cumin, and 1 tablespoon of fresh chopped chives. If you want a completely gluten-free version, using products with the crossed grain symbol, mix half chickpea flour and half rice flour (about 7 oz each).
