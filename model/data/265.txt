instructions:
To prepare the ricotta and orange fritters with chocolate chips, crack the eggs into a bowl, add the sugar , and whisk with electric beaters until you get a light and frothy mixture .
Incorporate the drained ricotta and flavor the batter with the zest of an orange . At this point, sift the dry ingredients separately and add them to the batter .
Finish by adding the chocolate chips and mix again with the beaters until you have a smooth mixture .
Heat the vegetable oil in a pot and bring it to 340°F. Fry the fritters: scoop a spoonful of batter and dip the batter into the hot oil . Cook for 3/4 minutes or until golden, then drain the fritters .
Place them on a tray lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil . Let them cool slightly and then garnish with powdered sugar to taste . The ricotta and orange fritters with chocolate chips are ready to enjoy .
Like all fried foods, it's best to eat the ricotta and chocolate fritters as soon as they're ready; if necessary, you can store them for up to one day in an airtight container at room temperature.
If you don't like the aroma of orange zest, you can replace it with vanilla extract.
Use a kitchen thermometer to keep the oil constant at 340°F. If the oil is too hot, you risk burning the outside of the fritters while leaving them raw inside; on the other hand, if the oil isn't hot enough, the fritters will absorb too much oil and end up greasy and not crispy.
