To prepare tofu with peppers, first, make the Vegetable broth following our recipe. Wash the peppers, cut them , and remove the seeds and internal filaments . Then cut them into strips .
Also, slice the onion into thin slices . In a non-stick pan, pour the oil, add the onion and the peppers .
Add the soy sauce , the cloves , which you can place in a spice filter for easier removal, and a pinch of salt .
Pour in the broth , stir , cover with a lid , and cook on low heat for 15-20 minutes. At the end of cooking, remove the cloves.
In the meantime, cut the tofu into 1/2 inch cubes . Once the peppers are cooked, add the tofu to the pan and stir .
Cover again with the lid and continue cooking for another 10 minutes. Plate and finish with a few marjoram leaves . Tofu with peppers is ready to be served .
Tofu with peppers can be stored in the refrigerator in a closed container for up to 2-3 days.
For a more tantalizing version, try browning the tofu separately in a pan with a little oil until golden and crispy. Then add it to the peppers only at the end of cooking. You can vary the recipe to always enjoy it with seasonal vegetables such as squash, zucchini, eggplants, etc.
