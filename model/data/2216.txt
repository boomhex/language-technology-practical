instructions:
To prepare oven-baked rabbit, start by making the Vegetable broth ; alternatively, you can use an equal weight of hot water. Then chop the rosemary , transfer half of it to a pan where you have poured 3 tbsps of oil , and add the peeled garlic clove .
Add a bay leaf and let everything simmer on low heat for 2-3 minutes. At this point, increase the heat and add the rabbit pieces , let them brown on both sides for 3-4 minutes , salt, and pepper.
Then deglaze with white wine . Once the alcohol has evaporated, add a ladle of broth and let it cook on low for another 5-6 minutes .
In the meantime, prepare the potatoes by peeling and cutting them into rather large chunks . Slice the onion as well .
Transfer everything to a bowl, season with the chopped rosemary needles set aside earlier , thyme leaves , salt, and pepper .
Drizzle with 1.5 tbsps of oil and mix the potatoes and onions to season them evenly. Transfer everything to a large baking sheet, oiled with about 2 tsps of oil , so that the potatoes and onions are well distributed. Then also place the previously browned rabbit pieces .
Add the remaining vegetable broth and cook the rabbit together with the potatoes in a preheated static oven at 400°F for 40 minutes. Once out of the oven , serve your oven-baked rabbit while it's still steaming !
The oven-baked rabbit can be stored for a maximum of 1 day in the refrigerator in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
To make the oven-baked rabbit even more flavorful, try adding other spices, like curry or paprika!
