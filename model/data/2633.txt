Ciambelline al forno brings a little taste of Italy right into your kitchen, with a modern twist that's just lighter and even more fun. Really good stuff. These soft, round treats are made with a dough that gets plenty of time to rise, so every bite is really tender and aromatic. Instead of the usual frying, they're baked, making them a bit healthier—perfect for anyone who wants to enjoy a sweet snack without feeling too heavy afterward.
The tops? Covered with colorful sugar sprinkles and poppy seeds, giving them a look that kids love and a subtle crunch that pairs well with their moist texture. Which is great. It’s one of those ricetta ciambelline ideas that works well for birthdays, snack time, or just when you want to bring a little Italian sweetness to your day. People all over Italy put their own spin on these, but the baked version, or ciambelle al forno , is a favorite for those who like their treats softer and a bit less oily.
Pairing these ciambelline al forno with a glass of milkshake alla fragola really takes things up a notch. And you know what? The classic strawberry flavor is always a hit, especially when fresh berries are in season, but folks sometimes switch things up with chocolate or whatever fruit is best that month. The cold, creamy milkshake and the fluffy ciambelline are just a perfect match—kind of the Italian answer to milk and cookies, but a little fancier.
For families, this combo is a go-to for after-school snacks or special weekend treats. It's sweet enough to feel like a dessert but not so heavy that it ruins dinner. Really, the whole idea is about making a snack that feels special and a little festive, which is why dolci al forno like this show up at parties and celebrations all over Italy. No matter how you make your milkshake fatto in casa , serving it up next to some ciambelline soffici is going to get everyone smiling. For sure. From the first golden bite to the last sweet sip, this is the kind of snack that’s easy to love and even easier to share.
To prepare the carnival mini donuts, pour half a portion of milk, dissolve the yeast and the malt . In another, mix the remaining milk with the sugar ,
then the egg along with the yolks . In the bowl of a stand mixer, sift the two flours and add the grated zest of an untreated lemon and the seeds from a vanilla pod ,
use the paddle attachment, then slowly add the milk in which you dissolved the malt and the egg mixture . When all the ingredients are combined, replace the paddle
with the dough hook . Add the butter a piece at a time, waiting for each to be incorporated before adding another , and finally the salt .
When the dough is well wrapped around the hook, remove it from the bowl, place it on a lightly oiled work surface, and form a ball ; let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature away from drafts in a bowl covered with plastic wrap: the dough will double in size .
After this time, grease the work surface and roll the dough into a sheet 0.79 inches high ; cut circles with a diameter of 3.54 inches with a pastry cutter , place them on a baking sheet, and use a pastry cutter with a diameter of 1.38 inches to make a hole in the center ,
cover with plastic wrap and let rise for another 1 hour . Brush the mini donuts with a beaten yolk or with a tablespoon of water and garnish with sugar sprinkles or poppy seeds. Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 15 minutes (if using a convection oven, 320°F for about 5 minutes). For best results, you can bake one mini donut to gauge the most appropriate time for baking the others.
Bake the mini donuts in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 15 minutes (if using a convection oven, 320°F for about 5-8 minutes). For best results, you can bake one mini donut to gauge the most appropriate time for baking the others. While the mini donuts are cooling slightly, prepare the milkshake: in a blender, place the washed strawberries with their green leaves removed. Then add the banana pieces and the milk .
Blend everything and pour the mixture into glasses ! Then take the baked mini donuts out of the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack before serving them with the milkshake, perhaps for a small party!
Store the baked mini donuts under a glass dome.
You can freeze them once formed before the second rising, then thaw them in the fridge and let them rise for another hour before baking.
If you prefer, you can garnish the mini donuts with granulated sugar or cinnamon, brushing them first with melted butter. You can make the milkshake with your preferred seasonal fruit or chocolate!
