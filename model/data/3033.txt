So grab your ingredients and enjoy a cool, tasty escape from the heat!
To prepare the iced mocha, start with the chocolate: in a bowl put the sugar, add the sifted unsweetened cocoa powder , and mix with a teaspoon , then pour the cold milk into a saucepan .
Now add the cocoa mixed with sugar to the milk and dissolve them by stirring with a whisk to eliminate lumps . Then turn on the heat. When it begins to boil, reduce to a simmer and let it cook for 10 minutes. Once ready, pour the chocolate into a bowl and cover it with cling film in contact , let it cool at room temperature and then put it in the fridge for 2 hours to thicken.
After the necessary time, take the chocolate out of the fridge. In a container, pour 200 ml (about 0.85 cups) of cold milk, add 200 g (about 7 oz) of cold chocolate (keep the rest aside for the final garnish) , mixing to temper it until you get a thick and homogeneous mixture and set it aside .
Now proceed to prepare the whipped cream for garnishing (you can also consult the procedure here: How to Whip Cream ). Pour the well-cold fresh liquid cream into a large bowl and with the cold beaters of an electric mixer, whip the cream until stiff peaks form . At this point, add the sifted powdered sugar and incorporate it into the cream with a spatula, mixing from bottom to top to avoid deflating, and set aside.
Now you can prepare the coffee with the moka pot: pour the cold water, preferably low in limescale, inside the boiler up to the safety valve (otherwise you will get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee and level it with each added teaspoon of coffee by tapping the filter on the table with firm movements , until reaching the edge of the filter.
Do not press with the teaspoon, nor make holes, and screw the coffee maker tightly (to prevent coffee from leaking from the sides as it rises), then place it on a low and steady flame, to obtain a full-bodied coffee. As the coffee rises, a thick foam will form ; we recommend not letting the coffee bubble for too long, to keep its aroma and sweetness intact. Then turn off the heat, stir the coffee directly in the moka with a teaspoon to make it more homogeneous , and your coffee for use in the preparation is ready.
Then proceed to assemble your iced mocha. For each tall glass, put 6-7 ice cubes, then pour in the order first 50 ml (about 0.21 cups) of cold chocolate , then 50 ml (about 0.21 cups) of coffee leaving 1-1.5 inches from the rim. Stir and finish preparing the iced mocha with the whipped cream garnish, using a pastry bag with a star nozzle. Continue in the same way for the other glasses. You can optionally add more melted chocolate on top of the cream for an even tastier iced mocha !
It is recommended to consume the iced mocha immediately. You can store the chocolate for a maximum of 1-2 days in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap.
