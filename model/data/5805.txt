To prepare soft-boiled eggs, make sure to use very fresh and whole eggs. Place a pot full of water on the stove and bring it to a gentle boil. Once it reaches a boil, carefully place the eggs inside , and they should cook for 4 minutes : you can use a timer to track the exact time. Keep in mind that the egg's temperature and size can affect the cooking time: calculate 4 minutes from boiling for medium-sized, fridge-cold eggs; a maximum of 3 minutes for room-temperature eggs. Once ready, gently drain them into a bowl .
Place one on the egg cup , then gently tap the top part of the egg with a teaspoon to break the shell. Remove any shell fragments and peel away the egg white until you reveal the semi-liquid yolk .
