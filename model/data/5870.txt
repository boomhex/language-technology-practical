instructions:
Pea hummus is an original springtime variation of the typical Middle Eastern dish, chickpea hummus , to be enjoyed as an appetizer, spread on toasted bread crostini or served with pita or falafel, in the traditional way. We've kept the tahini f rom the original recipe, an aromatic sauce made from sesame seeds, which gives this ancient cream its distinctive flavor. To speed up the preparation we used a blender, a valid alternative to a pestle and mortar. Try our recipe and experiment with other delicious variations of homemade hummus:
To prepare the pea hummus, shell the peas to obtain about 370 g . Bring a pot of salted water to the boil . Blanch the peas for about 3 minutes .
Drain and rinse them under cold water and ice to maintain their color. Pour the peas into a mug and add the chickpeas .
Season with the tahini , pour the extra virgin olive oil and the lemon juice .
Salt to taste and flavor with lemon zest . Also add the mint leaves .
Blend with an immersion blender . Once you have obtained a homogeneous cream , adjust the salt and pepper. Serve the pea hummus with mint leaves, pepper and mixed sesame seeds .
You can use frozen peas as an alternative to fresh ones. You can flavor the hummus with chili pepper or cumin.
