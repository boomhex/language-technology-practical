Salmone marinato al forno is one of those dishes that's both special and, honestly, really easy to make. The secret sauce? The salmon soaks in this aromatic marinade filled with fennel and anise seeds. Really amazing stuff. These little seeds give the fish a fresh and kinda tangy vibe, making it so so different from the usual honey garlic or teriyaki salmon you'd find in restaurants. And you know what? Italian cooks love using bay leaf, dill, and thyme, which, to be honest, give everything a balsamic, green aroma that just makes you want to dig in.
After soaking up all those flavors, the fillet gets this crispy crust from almond flour, breadcrumbs, and a hint of paprika. Seriously good. It turns into a baked marinated salmon that's anything but boring, especially with that golden layer that cracks when you cut into it—pretty awesome, right? One of the best parts about this easy salmon recipe is its versatility. Pretty much. In northern Italian kitchens, there might be a bit more dill, while down south, there's often extra fennel for even more of that herby punch.
The whole thing bakes up in the oven, giving you oven-baked salmon that's super moist and packed with a punch from all those spices and herbs. It's really a great option for a healthy salmon dinner or when you want a quick salmon meal that's, you know, different from the usual. Everyone at the table can taste the difference from how the marinade seeps into the fish, delivering a tender bite with a bit of crunch on the outside. Even picky eaters dig this family-friendly salmon dish because the flavors are big but not overwhelming.
You can mix up the spices based on what you like, so every time you make it, there’s something new happening. And here's the thing: this fish dish shows you don't need anything fancy—just good herbs, a bit of spice, and a touch of Italian inspiration. It's perfect for any occasion, whether it's a weeknight dinner or a special gathering, proving that simple ingredients can really create something amazing.
To prepare baked marinated salmon, start by cleaning the salmon fillet (if you bought a whole salmon, you will need to remove the entrails and fillet it). Using kitchen tweezers, remove the bones , then gently peel the skin off with a sharp knife starting from the tail (2-3) to separate the skin from the fillet.
Once cleaned, you should obtain about 1.75 lbs of salmon fillet . At this point, you can prepare the marinade: pour the oil into a high-sided ceramic or glass baking dish . Add all the aromatics: lemon juice and grated zest ,
black pepper, pink pepper, salt, dill, thyme, bay leaf, anise seeds, and fennel seeds . Add the salmon fillets and gently massage them so that the marinade flavor penetrates the flesh. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let the salmon marinate for 24 hours in the refrigerator.
Meanwhile, prepare the breading by combining the breadcrumbs with almond flour, then add the sweet paprika , parsley, finally salt and pepper. Once marinated, remove the salmon from the fridge at least an hour before baking, so it reaches room temperature. Place it on a cutting board, cut out 4 equal portions to ensure even cooking in the oven,
and place them in the baking dish and salt . Strain the marinade oil using a sieve . Add the strained oil to the breading
and mix well to moisten the breading . Cover the entire surface of the marinated salmon with the moistened breading (17-18). Cook the marinated salmon in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 10 minutes (or in a convection oven at 320°F for 6-7 minutes). After 10 minutes, change the oven mode from static to grill, increase the temperature to 445°F and grill the marinated salmon for another 5 minutes. When the breading is nicely golden, remove the baked marinated salmon from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
Once cooked, baked marinated salmon can be stored in the fridge for no more than two days in an airtight container. It is possible to freeze the baked marinated salmon only if fresh salmon was used.
I like to propose recipes that can be served and enjoyed by everyone, but... I also like to propose recipes that can be modified according to your taste (and that of those seated at the table with you!). So, I suggest using an orange (or vinegar) to replace the lemon in the marinade: less obvious but tastier, like strong paprika, which can take the place of sweet paprika in the breading. Also, for a bolder and spicier result, why not add a mix of parsley, garlic, and chili pepper to the marinade?
