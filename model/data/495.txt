instructions:
To prepare the lunch box with couscous and salmon, start with the vegetables: clean the bell pepper of seeds and internal filaments, then cut it into 4 long strips . Place the pepper on a hot grill and grill until grill marks appear . Finally, cut it into 3/4-inch pieces .
Trim the zucchini and slice them about 1/4 inch thick . Grill the zucchini as well and cut them into pieces the same size as the bell pepper .
Meanwhile, bring a small pot of water to a boil. Put the couscous in a bowl and season with turmeric , salt, and pepper . Pour boiling water until it covers the couscous by about 1/2 inch .
Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 5 minutes . After this time, the water will have been absorbed, so fluff the couscous with a fork and drizzle with a little oil .
You are ready to transfer the ingredients to your lunch box: couscous on one side , then zucchini and bell peppers .
Add the carrots previously cleaned, trimmed of the ends, and cut into julienne strips . Then add the pitted olives and the sun-dried tomatoes cut into pieces .
Finally, add the grilled salmon . Close with the lid : your lunch box is ready to be transported... remember to shake before enjoying !
The lunch box with couscous and salmon can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
You can replace the salmon with tuna or use other seasonal vegetables to your liking!
