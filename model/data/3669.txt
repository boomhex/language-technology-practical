Lightly pound the knots with the meat mallet , then with a smooth-edged pointed knife (or kitchen scissors), make small cuts on the edges of each knot , so that during cooking the meat does not curl up;
thoroughly coat the knots in flour , then shake them to remove the excess. Cut the chili pepper into rings and place it in a rather large pan, along with the olive oil, bay leaf, sage, and rosemary, then sauté the ingredients .
Add the floured knots to the pan and let them brown on both sides. Meanwhile, finely chop half of the pitted olives , and when the knots are golden on both sides ,
pour in the glass of white wine , add the chopped and whole olives , and let it evaporate completely over low heat for about 15-20 minutes, adding hot water (or broth) as needed. Keep a small amount of cooking liquid in the pan (by adding liquid), so that at the end, the knots have a sauce with which to be drizzled . Serve the knots hot, garnishing the serving plates with aromatic herbs.
If desired, this recipe can also be prepared with veal knots, which are less economical but equally tasty. If you like, add a clove of garlic to brown with the aromatic herbs, and according to your taste, vary or add spices or aromas.
