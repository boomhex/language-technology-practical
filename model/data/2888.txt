Rollè di macinato con teglia di verdure is that kind of polpettone di carne macinata you'd totally find at a family table in Emilia-Romagna —especially when guests drop by. You know, this dish really stands out by mixing moist ground meat, fresh herbs, and authentic Parmigiano Reggiano straight from the region. And look, you get this awesome blend where the meat stays so tender thanks to the cheese and the super careful way it’s cooked. Inside, it's packed with sautéed greens, lightly cooked with garlic and olive oil for that savory Mediterranean kick. It's not just your regular rotolo di carne macinata —it comes with a roasted veggie tray that gives you those crispy edges and a splash of color on your plate. Pretty simple. It's a classic Sunday second course but, seriously, it's handy 'cause you can prep it ahead of time and finish it in the oven when your friends show up.

And you know, even if you're not a pro, this dish gives you that homemade vibe. Feels special, yet it’s chill enough for a weeknight. People often call it a polpettone fatto in casa or a polpettone ripieno if you fill it with extra greens or cheese. Either way, it fits perfectly with those cozy Northern Italian dinners where the food looks good, tastes even better, and somehow makes everyone linger just a little longer around the table. For sure. Whether for a festive gathering or a simple family dinner, this dish brings a touch of Italian warmth and simplicity to any meal, making it a beloved choice in many homes. And the sauce?

To prepare the ground meat roll with the vegetable tray, start by preparing the roll: wash the greens, cut them , and cook them in a pan with a drizzle of oil and a clove of garlic until tender .
Once cooked, chop the greens and set them aside to cool. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, place the ground meat, add the eggs, grated cheese , and the chopped aromatic herbs ,
the breadcrumbs . Mix the dough with your hands to combine all the ingredients . Take a sheet of plastic wrap and place it on a work surface, and spread the ground meat over it, shaping the dough into a rectangle of about 9x10 inches .
Spread the filling on top: first a layer of greens and then a layer of grated Parmesan cheese (11-12).
Roll up the roll using the plastic wrap (13-14), making sure to seal the two ends with the ground meat .
Press the ground meat into the plastic wrap so that it takes the shape of the roll . Once you have the roll, place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush it with olive oil . Bake the roll in a Samsung 3 oven using the automatic setting for single cooking A-12, placing the tray on the lower shelf, turning the roll halfway through cooking when the oven beeps. Before finishing cooking, move it to the top shelf to get a crispy crust. While the roll cools, take care of the vegetables: wash the broccoli, separate the florets from the central stem, and cut them in half .
Wash and trim the zucchini, cut them in half lengthwise, and then into wedges . Wash the carrots and cut them using the same method as the zucchini . Continue by washing the potatoes, then peel them and cut them into small wedges the same size as the other vegetables to ensure even cooking .
Finally, wash and halve the cherry tomatoes . Finely chop the aromatic herbs: rosemary, bay leaf, thyme, and sage . Blanch the carrots for a few minutes and
the potatoes . Take a large tray, pour in a drizzle of oil , and transfer all the previously cut vegetables inside, seasoning with the chopped herbs
a clove of garlic, salt , ground pepper, and then cover them with a layer of breadcrumbs . Cook in a Samsung 3 oven using the automatic setting for single cooking A17 (roasted vegetables), at the end of the program, move the tray to the top shelf and turn on the grill for a few minutes to achieve a better browning . The dishes are ready: slice the ground meat roll and serve it with the roasted vegetable tray.
You can store the roll in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, for a couple of days. It is possible to freeze the roll either raw or cooked if fresh ingredients have been used. The roasted vegetable tray can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a couple of days and can be frozen after cooking.
For a richer flavor, you can fill the roll with pecorino cheese or slices of provolone or Emmentaler.
