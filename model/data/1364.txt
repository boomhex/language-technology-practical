And chocolate and apricot cake is a classic in Italian home baking. It really shows off how fruit and chocolate just work so well together. People in Italy—trust me—have been pairing apricots and chocolate for ages. And you can taste why every time you bite into these tender, moist little cakes. They're not some fancy pastry shop thing. Nope. They’re the sort of sweet treat you’d find in an Italian kitchen, especially in the afternoon during merenda, that much-loved snack break.
What makes this chocolate and apricot cake different is how soft and sweet it turns out. Seriously good. Those juicy apricots melt right into the mix, and the rich chocolate gives it a deep flavor without being too much. You get a bit of fruit in every bite, which goes so well with the soft crumb of the cake.
Italian kids love grabbing these little cakes for their school snack or when heading outside for a picnic. And you know what? They’re easy to carry and don’t make a mess. It’s the sort of chocolate apricot dessert that works for pretty much any occasion: after dinner, with coffee, or tucked into a lunchbox for later.
Families often make a batch on weekends. Really. Swapping out the apricots for whatever’s ripe, but the apricot chocolate cake version is a true staple. The best part is how simple the recipe is—no need for complicated steps or hard-to-find stuff. Italian home bakers count on these cakes to stay moist for days, and they’re just as good cold as they are fresh out of the oven.
Some regions even add a bit of apricot jam for extra sweetness, or sprinkle a handful of crisp, chopped chocolate on top for a bit of crunch. When you’re after a simple, no-fuss sweet, this chocolate apricot cake hits the spot and feels a bit like a small piece of Italian family life, right at your own table. Whether it’s a casual gathering or a special treat, these cakes bring a taste of Italy to any moment, making them a favorite among both kids and adults. Can’t go wrong.
To prepare the apricot and chocolate cupcakes, start by leaving the ingredients at room temperature. Chop the chocolate and let it melt in a bain-marie , stirring occasionally. Once melted, add the butter ,
stir until it is melted , then let it cool slightly. Meanwhile, separate the eggs , whip the egg whites to stiff peaks and set them aside.
In another bowl, beat the yolks, gradually adding the sugar . It will take about 5 minutes, then slowly pour in the melted chocolate , the milk and turn off the mixer.
You should obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture . Sift the flour, potato starch , cocoa
and the baking powder into the bowl. Mix with a wooden spoon, making sure no lumps form . Then add the whipped egg whites ,
gently folding them from bottom to top , until you have a fluffy and smooth mixture . Take the apricots, wash and dry them. Then, without peeling, cut them ,
and separate the two halves . Using a teaspoon, remove the pit . Take the chocolate batter and divide it into 6 molds 4 inches wide on top, 3.5 inches at the base, and 1.2 inches high .
You should pour about 2 oz of batter into each mold. Place each apricot half in the center of each mold with the skin side up. Bake the cupcakes in a static oven, preheated to 350°F for about 25-28 minutes. Then remove them from the oven and let them cool before removing them from the molds. Decorate with powdered sugar and serve.
The apricot and chocolate cupcakes can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days covered with plastic wrap. If you prefer, you can also freeze them.
Make your apricot and chocolate cupcakes even more delicious by sprinkling crumbled amaretti on top before baking. For an even more aromatic effect, sprinkle the apricots with brown sugar.
