instructions:
To make pasta alla vesuviana (spicy pasta), clean the red onion and slice it thinly . Also cut the fresh chilli pepper and olives into thin slices.
Carefully drain the mozzarella and cut it into small pieces . Place a pot full of salted water to boil, which will be used to cook the pasta. Pour the olive oil into a pan , add the onion
and chili pepper . Let the onion stew over medium heat adding a couple of ladles of water from the pasta until the onion is soft and golden. Now pour the peeled tomatoes and crush them slightly with a wooden spoon .
Then season with olives, capers and salt. Cook the sauce for about 12 minutes over low heat. In the meantime, cook the spaghetti in boiling water for the time indicated on the package . When the sauce is cooked, add the mozzarella cheese
and add the fresh oregano . Drain the pasta, transfer it directly into the pan with the sauce and stir with a ladle of cooking water . Mix and serve your pasta alla vesuviana (spicy pasta) hot .
We suggest eating the pasta immediately , but you can keep the sauce in the fridge for a couple of days.
If there is leftover pasta, a good way to reuse it is to make a very tasty pan-fried pasta frittata, which is also traditional in Naples.
