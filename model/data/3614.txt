Separate the yolks from the whites; in the mixer, cream the butter with half the sugar and the vanilla bean seeds until you get a creamy and white mixture . If you don't have a mixer, proceed the same way by placing sugar and butter in a large bowl and beating them with electric beaters. Combine the flours with the baking powder in a bowl (2-3).
Sift the dry ingredients and collect them in a bowl, then set them aside . Add the yolks, one at a time, to the butter and sugar mixture in the mixer , and work for at least ten minutes or until you get a very soft and frothy cream .
Transfer the butter-sugar and egg mixture into a clean bowl and add the sifted flours , mix everything gently with the help of a spatula . Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt and the other half of the sugar, adding it little by little. Gently fold the stiffly beaten egg whites into the mixture, a little at a time, with a movement from bottom to top.
Butter and flour a 11-inch round mold and pour in the batter ; bake in a hot oven at 356°F for 45 minutes; check the baking by inserting a toothpick into the center, which should come out dry. Let it cool for about ten minutes in the mold and then turn it out onto a cake rack; once the cake is completely cold, cut it in half horizontally with the help of a bread knife; pour the lingonberry jam into the center and gently spread it to the edges using a flat spatula .
Carefully take the other base of the cake and gently place it on top of the jam-spread one (13-14). Dust with plenty of powdered sugar and serve.
This rustic cake is also excellent filled with different jams that always have a slightly sour aftertaste like raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, or a mix of berries. For an even more pronounced flavor, the warm cake can be accompanied by a scoop of cinnamon or vanilla ice cream, enhancing the aroma of the buckwheat and the jam.
