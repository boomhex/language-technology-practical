Focaccine di patate alla birra is the kind of food that, honestly, takes any get-together in Veneto to the next level. These little rounds of potato beer flatbread have this super moist and tender texture. Why? Because of the mashed potatoes and beer mixed right into the dough. Seriously, people in Italy swear it’s the beer that makes the dough super fluffy—so you end up with bread that's way way better than your typical flatbread. Before the dough even gets rolled out, the potatoes are cooked with thyme and bay leaf, adding this delicate aroma you’ll notice in every bite. Once the dough doubles in size, it’s cut into small disks, which is great for snacks or a plate of finger foods.
And you know what? Some people like to top these focaccine with thin potato slices, a few olives, or even fennel seeds. It turns a basic beer bread recipe into something so so flavorful and, to be honest, pretty fun to eat. You'll sometimes see a version stuffed with gorgonzola, which is just one example of how every region in Italy seems to have their own twist on the classic mashed potato flatbread . These are made for moments when you want something crispy on the outside but still soft in the middle—think informal buffet, or just an easy flatbread recipe for hanging out with friends.
Here’s the thing, they’re not fussy. You get all the good stuff from real homemade flatbread without tons of effort. Really satisfying flavors. Folks love using them as a base for savory toppings or just enjoying them fresh out of the oven with a cold drink. With their mix of comforting potato and that hint of beer, they’re really different from your regular bread and a great way to try something new from Italian potato bread recipe ideas. Whether you’re in the heart of Italy or just dreaming about it, these focaccine bring a taste of Veneto’s charm right to your table.
To prepare the potato beer focaccias, first boil the potato in plenty of water . When it is very tender, peel it and mash it with a potato masher . In a bowl, mix the semolina flour and all-purpose flour .
Add the salt and sugar (4-5), then the mashed potato .
Dissolve the yeast in warm water (alternatively, you can use 12 g of fresh yeast) and add the liquid to the other ingredients . At this point, also pour the beer in a stream and
finally the oil . Knead with your hands, gathering all the ingredients then transfer the dough to the pastry board and continue kneading until you get a smooth and firm dough . If you have a stand mixer, you can knead first with the paddle at medium speed to gather the ingredients, and then with the hook for 10 minutes at medium speed.
Place the dough in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap . Let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature, or in a warm environment, until the dough has doubled its initial volume and is well risen . Roll out on a well-floured board a sheet about 0.39 inches high and
using a pastry cutter with a diameter of 3.35 inches, cut out the focaccias . Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and let them rise for another hour . Meanwhile, cut the olives into rings and
thinly slice the well-washed but unpeeled potatoes . Cook the potatoes for about 10 minutes in plenty of salted water, flavoring it with thyme and bay leaf . When the potatoes are very tender, drain them .
After the last hour of rising, press the focaccias in the center to form the edge , brush them with oil and place a few olive slices, halved potato slices, and fennel seeds in the center . Bake the focaccias in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 15 minutes (if convection, 356°F for 12 minutes), remove and serve your potato beer focaccias!
Enjoy the potato beer focaccias while still warm! If any are left, store them in the refrigerator for a day and reheat in the oven before serving. Freezing is not recommended.
If you want a more aromatic dough, grind some fennel seeds and add them to the dough for flavor.
