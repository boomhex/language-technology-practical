instructions:
To prepare the French meringue (basic dough) , take the eggs and separate the yolks from the whites . Pour the egg whites into a stand mixer with a whisk attachment and start whisking them until stiff peaks form; sift the powdered sugar into a bowl and
add it one tablespoon at a time to the egg whites . Continue using the stand mixer until you get a white and fluffy meringue .
Put a few tablespoons of the meringue you obtained into a small bowl and add liquid food coloring (or paste) according to the color and shade you wish to achieve : in our case, we chose red coloring to get pink meringues; mix well with a teaspoon to achieve an even color. Take a piping bag with a star nozzle and with a brush, paint the edges with the colored meringue you prepared , then with the help of a spatula, transfer the remaining white meringue (without coloring) that you set aside into the piping bag .
On a buttered baking sheet lined with parchment paper, make small meringue dollops spaced apart: with our quantities, you should get 24 pieces . Dry the meringues in a convection oven at 194°F for at least 3 hours, keeping the oven door slightly open. Once ready , remove from the oven and let cool: your shaded meringues are ready to be served; you can also use other colors, like blue , or mix different tones to create various shades!
You can store the shaded meringues in an airtight container or tin for 10 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Let your imagination run wild: have fun mixing different colors to achieve always new and original shades! If you want a softer center, I recommend reducing the cooking time from 3 hours to 1 hour: the outer surface of the meringues will be perfectly dry, while the inside will be soft.
