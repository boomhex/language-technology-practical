Golden yellow ribbons of Tajarin pasta bring bright color and a soft texture that stands out on any dinner table—right away, it looks inviting with long, tender noodles and a rich shine. Every bite pairs buttery-smooth Tajarin pasta with a deeply flavorful meat sauce and a bold liver sauce unique to classic Piedmontese pasta dishes, packing both great Italian taste and a little adventure. Families recognize this as the authentic choice from beloved traditional Italian recipes , especially when everyone’s craving a cozy, satisfying meal that’s a bit different from usual pasta night. Hearty beefy notes from the sauce blend in with just enough earthiness from the liver to make it special—kids and adults notice how nicely the flavors work together, and it just LOOKS really good on the plate. Even casual family dinners can feel a little more exciting when Tagliolini alla Langarola is what’s being served…it’s got that real-deal Italian comfort factor people love, and there’s plenty for everyone around the table to dig in and enjoy.
Busy home cooks appreciate when a dish is reliable— Tajarin Al Ragù never fails to deliver DEEP, satisfying flavor and a texture that’s always moist but not heavy. Works for parties or just Sunday dinner, since the beautiful ribbon-like noodles handle rich toppings so well and look great served family-style (try with bread or a simple salad if you want to round things out). The boldness of the liver sauce makes it a real talking point, while the classic meat sauce keeps things appealing even for folks who aren’t sure. Wide appeal means it’s a really smart pick for mixed groups or picky eaters—there’s enough familiar comfort for everyone, but something a bit different for those who like to try new foods. Serving this specialty main course brings a touch of Northern Italy into a regular weeknight or family celebration. When it comes to hearty, real Italian dinners , nothing quite satisfies like a plate of Tajarin pasta with classic sauce combinations—plenty of flavor, plenty of smiles, and always a success at the table.
Make a mound with the flour; break the eggs in the center and add the oil . Knead until you obtain a smooth and elastic dough , which you will wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in the fridge for half an hour. Finely chop the onion .
Clean and cut the livers into small pieces . Peel, deseed, and chop the tomatoes into small pieces . To make it easier to peel the tomatoes, it's good to blanch them in water for a few minutes; the skin will come off more easily. In a large pan, melt the butter, add the onion and rosemary , and sauté until the onion is translucent.
Add the livers and brown them , then add the meat and cook everything for a few minutes, then add the broth. Stir in the peeled and chopped tomatoes ; mix well, salt, pepper, cover with a lid, and let cook on low heat for 40 minutes.
Roll out the pasta, making long strips that you will roll onto themselves , and with the help of a knife , cut them to a thickness of 1/16 inch, making the tajarin . Cook the tajarin in plenty of salted water for no more than 4 minutes. Serve them hot accompanied by the meat and liver ragout.
Sprinkle the pasta with flour on both sides before folding it onto itself to prevent it from sticking. If you prefer, it's possible to make the tajarin with the special pasta roller machine, equipped with the special attachment for cutting the pasta. Once cut, let the tajarin rest on a tray with flour and, if possible, let them dry in the sun.
