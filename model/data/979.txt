To prepare the mini custard tarts, start with the shortcrust pastry: place the flour, sugar , a pinch of salt, and room temperature butter cut into pieces in a bowl. Also, add the baking powder .
Work the dough with your hands until you get a sandy mixture . At this point, add the eggs and flavor with the grated zest of one lemon .
Knead by hand until you get a compact and homogeneous dough ball . Wrap the pastry in plastic wrap and place it in the fridge to rest for 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the custard: pour the milk into a saucepan with the lemon zest .
Bring the milk just to the boil . Meanwhile, place the yolks in a bowl along with the sugar and mix the mixture with a whisk .
Also add the cornstarch and incorporate it with the whisk until you obtain a smooth mixture without lumps . As soon as the milk starts to boil, remove the lemon zest .
Pour the hot milk slowly into the yolk mixture , stirring continuously . Transfer the mixture back into the saucepan and turn on the low heat .
Cook over a gentle heat, stirring continuously until the custard thickens . Transfer it into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap in contact, and let it cool first at room temperature and then in the fridge .
After the resting time, roll out the pastry with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 1/8-3/16 inches, using all-purpose flour to dust the work surface . Take tart molds of 4-5 inches and cut pastry discs slightly larger in diameter so they can cover both the base and the edges well .
Press the pastry well into the mold, then roll the rolling pin over the edge to remove excess pastry . Prick the bottom with a fork . Now roll out the leftover pastry, always to a thickness of 1/8-3/16 inches, and with a pastry wheel, cut strips about 1/5 inches wide to make the lattice . If the molds are non-stick, there will be no need to butter them.
Fill the pastry with the custard . Place 6 strips on each mini tart, positioning them first in one direction and then the other to create the lattice . Make all the mini custard tarts this way; with these quantities, you will get 8.
Place the mini tarts on a baking tray and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 35 minutes. When they are golden brown, take them out of the oven and let them cool, then remove them from the mold. Finally, dust with powdered sugar. Your mini custard tarts are ready to be enjoyed !
