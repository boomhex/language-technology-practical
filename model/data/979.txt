instructions:
To prepare the cornbread burgers with porcini, start with the basic dough. Pour the 2 flours into a bowl, add the yeast and sugar and mix, pouring the water gradually while kneading with a wooden spoon. Add the oil and lastly a pinch of salt. As soon as it reaches a firmer consistency, transfer the dough to the work surface and knead it for a few minutes, folding it several times on itself. Place it in an oiled bowl and let it rise for 12 hours covered with plastic wrap. Once the dough has doubled in size, divide it into 4 pieces, shape them into balls, and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover them with plastic wrap, making sure it doesn't tighten, otherwise it will prevent the buns from rising: let them rise for about 1 and a half hours. At this point, score the buns with a cross on the surface and bake them at 356°F for 25–30 minutes in the lower part of the oven, placing a pan filled with water at the bottom: this will provide the right humidity during baking. Meanwhile, clean the porcini caps with a damp cloth, scraping off any soil residues. Emulsify the oil with the pressed garlic, adjust with salt and pepper, and massage the mushrooms with the seasoning. In a well-heated pan, sear them over high heat for about 6-7 minutes per side. In the meantime, remove the leaves from the radicchio, wash, dry, and julienne it. Season with a bit of oil, salt, and vinegar. Now you have everything: cut the buns in half, place the cheese slices on the bases, and bake at 392°F for about 5 minutes. Add the tops of the buns and bake for another 2 minutes. Complete the filling with the porcini caps and radicchio: serve your cornbread burgers with porcini immediately.
Once the cornbread burgers with porcini are ready, it's best to consume them immediately.
Customize the filling to your liking. Can we suggest a bit of Guacamole or some sun-dried tomatoes?
