Dobos torte is really something special, I gotta say. This legendary Hungarian layer cake just takes you straight to the heart of Budapest's charming cafes. You know, the ones with velvet seats and all those brass accents? Yeah, those. It’s got these thin, moist sponge layers and then this rich, silky chocolate buttercream—super, super creamy. Honestly, the top is the showstopper: a chocolate caramel cake layer with this shiny, crispy caramel glaze. Cut into petal-shaped pieces, for real.
The magic, though, is in the contrast. The tender cake against the crunchy caramel—seriously good. It’s what makes Dobos stand apart from regular layered sponge cakes . It's not just dessert; it is like an experience. Think a stroll along the Danube or chilling in one of Budapest's cool coffee houses, sometimes called the ‘Paris of the East.’ And here's the thing: in Hungary, this traditional Hungarian dessert pairs perfectly with coffee. And look, as friends chat and savor that sweet, slightly tangy caramel, it’s just a vibe.
You'll find it alongside local goodies like goulash and sweet cheese pastries in bakeries, but dobos torte really stands out. That golden top, it's elegant. While some places have their own twist, the mix of moist cake, buttery chocolate, and crisp caramel—unchanged. It's really more than a treat; it's a celebration. Perfect for birthdays or any gathering.
The sight of those layers when sliced? And the caramel's crack? It’s basically inviting everyone to savor the moment. For anyone diving into European pastry , this cake offers an authentic taste of Budapest’s dessert scene—elegant, nostalgic. A true joy to share. So whether you're a dessert lover or just curious, the dobos torte gives you a slice of Hungary’s culinary magic, bringing together the best of flavors and traditions in every bite. Pretty simple, right?
To prepare the Dobos Torte, start by making the batter for the disks. Take the eggs and separate the yolks from the whites into two different bowls. Add half of the sugar to the whites and start whipping them until you get a foamy and firm mixture .
Set your whipped egg whites aside (in the refrigerator) and add the other half of the sugar to the yolks . Start whipping them, and once you obtain a light and fluffy mixture, add the butter (at room temperature) little by little and also the seeds from a vanilla bean (to extract them, you'll need to cut the bean and scrape it with a sharp knife).
At this point, incorporate the egg whites into the yolk mixture, little by little , stirring gently from bottom to top with a whisk . Sift the flour together with the cornstarch .
and incorporate it as well, using a whisk and stirring very gently and from bottom to top to avoid deflating the batter. Transfer the mixture into a disposable piping bag and use it to create the disks needed to assemble the dessert, which will be a total of 8. To create each disk, pipe about 3.5 oz of batter in a 9-inch cake ring placed on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and level it out with a spatula .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 7-8 minutes (if using a fan oven, bake at 356°F for about 5 minutes). Once baked , let them cool slightly, then gently remove them from the ring (14-15) and repeat the process for all the disks, then let them cool completely.
In the meantime, proceed to prepare the chocolate buttercream. Chop the chocolate, place it in a saucepan , and melt it in a double boiler , then pour it into a bowl and let it cool slightly , stirring it occasionally.
Place the sugar with the water in a thick-bottomed saucepan and heat it over low heat, stirring occasionally with a spoon. Once the sugar has dissolved, stop stirring and bring the syrup to a temperature of 250°F , using a kitchen thermometer. When the syrup is nearly at temperature, add the yolks to the bowl of a mixer and start whisking them at medium speed. As soon as the syrup reaches the indicated temperature, pour it in a thin stream into the mixer while it is still running . Continue to work it until completely cooled.
Meanwhile, cut the vanilla bean and extract the seeds. At this point, place the butter (at room temperature), previously cut into cubes, in a bowl, add the vanilla bean seeds , and with the help of a spatula, start working it until you get a homogeneous mixture . Then, gradually add your butter into the mixer while it's running .
Continue this way until all the butter is used and whip until you obtain a creamy mixture . At this point, incorporate the melted chocolate, now cooled, into the mixer , then transfer the chocolate buttercream into a bowl and also add the sifted cocoa powder .
Mix until everything is combined and transfer your chocolate buttercream into a piping bag with a plain nozzle and let it set in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. At this point, you're ready to assemble your Dobos Torte. Take the first cake disk and cover it with a layer of chocolate buttercream , place another disk on top , and continue alternating a layer of cream with each disk.
Finish in this way with all the disks except one which you should set aside for the final decoration, and leaving the last disk without cream . Cover your cake (composed of 7 disks) with chocolate buttercream, using a spatula, to achieve a smooth and even coating . Coat the sides of the cake with hazelnut crumbs and transfer the remaining cream into a piping bag with a star nozzle. Refrigerate both the cake and the cream.
In the meantime, proceed to prepare the caramel. Pour the sugar together with the water into a thick-bottomed saucepan and let it caramelize over moderate heat until it reaches an amber color . Take the reserved cake disk and pour the caramel over it .
With the help of a spatula, spread the caramel to cover the entire surface and let it dry for 2-3 minutes. Then, grease a knife with a smooth blade and use it to divide the disk into 16 wedges .
Take the cake from the fridge and use the piping bag with a star nozzle filled with chocolate buttercream to create decorative rosettes . Place the caramelized wedges on the cake obliquely between the various cream rosettes and finish the cake with one last rosette in the center . Refrigerate the Dobos Torte for at least 1 hour before serving.
Store your Dobos Torte in the refrigerator for 2-3 days at most and well-covered.
To make the preparation of the Dobos Torte easier, you can prepare both the disks and the cream a day in advance, then assemble the dessert at least an hour before serving.
The Dobos Torte was reportedly invented by Hungarian pastry chef József C. Dobos in 1884. It is said that thanks to a somewhat distracted assistant who made a mistake, whipping butter with sugar rather than with salt as was done at the time, Dobos created the buttercream to fill this cake. The dessert was officially presented during the Budapest Exhibition of 1885. From then on, it became the favored dessert of the entire Belle Epoque, and the first to taste it were Emperor Franz Joseph and Princess Sisi, who fell in love with it. József did not reveal the original recipe immediately, but it remained a closely guarded secret until he donated it to the Budapest Chamber of Confectioners at the end of his career.
