instructions:
To prepare the noodles with vegetables, first focus on cutting the vegetables. Trim and peel the carrots , then cut them into julienne strips with a thickness of 1/8 inch . Do the same for the zucchini .
Remove the stem, seeds, and internal filaments of the peppers , then cut them into julienne strips .
Cut off the green part of the leek, slice it into rounds of 1/5 inch thickness . Also slice the chili pepper into rounds and the onion into julienne strips .
In a bowl, pour the soy sauce and add the mirin , also add the grated ginger and garlic .
In a wok pan, pour the sunflower oil and, once it's hot, add the onion and sauté for 3 minutes. Add the carrots and zucchini .
Continue with the peppers , then season with salt and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. The vegetables should be cooked but still crispy. Turn off the heat and pour the soy sauce into the pan .
Add the bean sprouts and mix. Cook the noodles in plenty of salted boiling water , for the time indicated on the package, drain them, transfer them to the pan and mix again.
Plate and finish with some leek rings, the chili pepper , a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a few coriander leaves . The vegetable noodles are ready to be enjoyed .
Vegetable noodles should be consumed as soon as they're ready, but if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for up to 2 days. Before serving them again, heat them in a pan with a drizzle of oil or a tablespoon of soy sauce.
For a richer dish, you can add shredded chicken, shrimp, or diced tofu. Varying the vegetables according to the season is always a great idea, so you can use broccoli, shiitake mushrooms, Chinese cabbage, or bamboo shoots. If you like, you can also add teriyaki sauce.
