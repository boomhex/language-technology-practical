instructions:
To prepare the vatrushka, first, soak the raisins in water to hydrate them. Meanwhile, activate the yeast: pour the milk, sugar , yeast , and flour into a bowl.
Mix well until you get a homogeneous mixture , then cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in a warm place for 15 minutes.
In the meantime, melt the butter in a saucepan and let it cool slightly. After resting, take the pre-dough and transfer it to a larger bowl, then add the egg , warm milk , and sugar .
Add a pinch of salt and the melted butter . Mix well with a whisk to combine the ingredients .
Now sift the flour into the bowl and knead first with a fork and then with your hands until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough . Put it back in the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for an hour at room temperature.
Meanwhile, prepare the filling: place the tworog (or ricotta as an alternative) in a bowl, then add the egg , sugar , and vanilla extract . Blend with an immersion blender until you get a smooth cream.
Add the raisins and fold them into the cream , then set aside. Take the dough and divide it into 6 equal pieces .
Fold the edges towards the center and shape into balls . Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper .
Grease the bottom of a glass with vegetable oil and press into the center of each ball to create an indentation . Fill the indentations with the previously prepared cheese cream .
In a small bowl, mix an egg yolk and milk and use this mixture to brush only the dough . Bake in a static oven at 350°F for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and finish with a dusting of powdered sugar . Your vatrushka is ready to be enjoyed !
The vatrushka can be stored in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in a sealed container, for 2-3 days.
If you can't find tworog, you can use ricotta or other fresh creamy cheeses.
One of the most loved variations includes the addition of grated orange zest or cinnamon in the filling.
If you prefer, you can replace the raisins with dried cranberries, chopped dried apricots, nuts, or chocolate chips!
