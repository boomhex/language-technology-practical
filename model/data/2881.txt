Sfilati con fonduta al pepe nero is a real treat from Lombardy , bringing together the best of creamy cheese and crispy crunch. Imagine this: Italian breadsticks —those famous grissini—dipped into a black pepper fondue that’s super smooth and flavorful. Really, the magic’s in the cheese. Folks in Lombardy love using taleggio for its tender texture, but you might spot fontina or provola in the pot. The fondue’s kick comes from black pepper and a dash of nutmeg, giving it a warm, kinda sweet vibe. Then, there’s that extra touch—oven-roasted cherry tomatoes adding a bright, almost juicy flavor. And look, it all comes together in little terracotta bowls or even cute glasses—makes it feel special, for sure. Perfect way to start a big Italian dinner.
Everyone goes for the mix of melty cheese and golden breadsticks, especially when hanging out with friends or family. It’s super fun sharing grissini and watching that grissini with cheese dip stretch as you pull away—honestly, it’s hard not to grin. In Lombardy, this turns a regular get-together into a feast. People love how the tangy black pepper cheese fondue plays off the crunchy breadsticks. It’s more than just taste; the combo of moist dip and crunchy bread is really satisfying. You’ll find regional spins, too—sometimes more pepper, sometimes extra cheese, always a twist. Whether you call it grissini with black pepper fondue or just a reason to eat lots of cheese, it’s a snack that totally works at parties, family dinners, or lazy weekends. Try it once, and you’ll see why folks in Lombardy think it’s the way to start any meal—good laughs, great food, and that rich, cheesy taste that lingers long after the last bite. Pretty simple, really.
To prepare the breadsticks with black pepper fondue, start with the fondue: slice the taleggio and then cut it into coarse cubes. In a large saucepan, pour the milk , then add salt and pepper to taste.
Heat the milk, then add the diced taleggio and cook over low heat, stirring with a whisk until a cream forms. Just before turning off the heat, add a bit of nutmeg . Then transfer your black pepper fondue into small glasses or terracotta dishes and serve with the breadsticks !
You can store the black pepper fondue in the refrigerator for 1 day covered with plastic wrap. Freezing is not recommended.
For a milder taste, you can make the black pepper fondue with another cheese of your choice: provolone or fontina, for example!
