instructions:
To prepare bread with sourdough starter, start with the dough. Pour the all-purpose flour and semolina into a bowl , add the malt , and slowly pour in the room temperature water while beginning to knead with your hands .
When the water is absorbed, add the sourdough starter, refreshed the day before and in any case at least 5 hours prior . Continue to knead. Add the oil and salt .
Work again with your hands until you get a homogeneous mixture. Cover with a cloth and let rest for 15-20 minutes. Now make the first round of folds. Take a piece of the dough, lift it gently, and bring it toward the center . Rotate the bowl and repeat this operation. Continue in this way until you have picked up all the outer pieces of the dough, having completely rotated the bowl.
Cover with a cloth and let rest for 15-20 minutes. Repeat these operations 3 more times , making 4 rounds of folds. You will notice that the dough becomes very smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 3 hours at room temperature.
It might take more or less time depending on the temperature; you will need to verify that the dough has doubled . At this point, place a cloth inside a bread basket 9 inches at the base and 12 inches on the surface. Dust with rice flour (or always semolina) 14 and set aside. Transfer the dough to the work surface .
Flatten it slightly to form a disc . Then make a three-fold, bringing one side of the dough towards the center first and then do the same with the other . Pinch gently to adhere the dough and rotate it so the seam goes downward .
Stretch it gently to form a loaf . Then transfer it to the bread basket, this time placing the opening upward . Cover with the cloth and let rise for another 2-3 hours.
When it has doubled in volume , transfer it to a baking sheet dusted with semolina . Gently remove any excess rice flour
and with a sharp blade, make a lengthwise cut along the entire length of the bread . At this point, bake the bread in a preheated oven at 437°F in static mode, add 10 ice cubes to the bottom of the oven, which when melted will release the right humidity, and bake for 20 minutes. Then switch to ventilated mode and bake the bread for another 10 minutes. Remove then the sourdough bread , transfer it to a rack and let it cool before serving .
Sourdough bread can be stored in a paper bag for 3-4 days. You can freeze it once it's cool. For convenience, you can cut the bread and freeze it already sliced.
If you want a longer fermentation, you need to use a stronger flour than the one used in the recipe; you can keep the yeast amount unchanged. Optionally, you can transfer the dough to the fridge after you've shaped the bread.
You can use semolina instead of rice flour to dust the cloth.
