instructions:
To prepare the amberjack gravlax, since this will not undergo any cooking, it is very important to ensure that it has been flash-frozen at the time of purchase (it is recommended to freeze the fillet for at least 96 hours at 0°F, already skinned, and then thaw it for preparation). How to clean the greater amberjack : remove the skin from the fillet using a very sharp knife, sliding it between the meat and the skin starting from the tail part to the end . Once the skin is removed
place the fillet in a baking dish and sprinkle the entire surface first with salt , then with brown sugar , and finally with finely chopped dill .
Make sure the dry marinade covers the entire fillet , then cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator for 12 hours. After this time, the amberjack will have absorbed both the salt and the sugar and released all its liquids .
At this point, rinse the fillet under running water and dry it with a sheet of kitchen paper. Place the fillet on a cutting board and slice it finely in a sashimi style . The amberjack gravlax is ready!
Once marinated, the amberjack gravlax can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days.
Enjoy the amberjack gravlax on a buttered crostino, in perfect Nordic style!
Before consuming raw, marinated, or not perfectly cooked fish, it is recommended to freeze it for at least 96 hours at 0°F in a domestic freezer marked with 3 or more stars, as per the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
