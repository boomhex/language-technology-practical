instructions:
To prepare ciambotta, first wash and cut all the vegetables: cut the bell peppers in half , remove the seeds and inner filaments, and cut them into large pieces . Peel the potatoes, halve them lengthwise, and cut them into chunks .
Cut the eggplant into chunks as well , then do the same with the zucchini, cutting them lengthwise first . Finally, cut the cherry tomatoes in half
and slice the onion into fairly thin wedges . Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onions , and sauté for about 5 minutes, then add the eggplants ,
the potatoes , the bell peppers , the zucchini
and the cherry tomatoes . Salt , pepper, and mix well, then add the basil, which you have previously washed and dried .
At this point, pour in the water and the tomato pulp , cover with the lid , and cook over medium heat for 30 minutes. Avoid stirring but occasionally shake the saucepan.
After this time, remove the lid and continue cooking for another 30 minutes, still over medium heat and still shaking the pot occasionally. Turn off the heat and serve your ciambotta hot or warm !
Ciambotta can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, in an airtight container.
If you wish, you can omit or add other vegetables according to your tastes, such as carrots, green beans, or Swiss chard. Add a pinch of chili pepper to give the dish an extra kick!
