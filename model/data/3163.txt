instructions:
To prepare the chocolate cream for pandoro, first chop the dark chocolate with a knife and collect it in a bowl . Melt the chocolate in the microwave or a bain-marie and let it cool slightly. In a saucepan, pour the water and sugar , then heat until it reaches a temperature of 250°F.
Meanwhile, place the egg yolks in the bowl of the stand mixer . If you don't have a kitchen thermometer, you'll know the syrup has reached the correct temperature when white bubbles form on the surface . Start whisking the egg yolks and slowly pour in the syrup once it reaches the temperature . Continue whisking for 5 minutes, until the mixture cools down.
At this point, add the lukewarm chocolate to the mixer and work for another 3 minutes . Place the mascarpone in a bowl and soften it with a whisk, then add the chocolate mixture .
Gently mix with the help of a spatula until you achieve a homogeneous consistency . Your chocolate cream for pandoro is ready to be served !
The chocolate cream for pandoro can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days in an airtight container.
We used a stand mixer, but you can easily use electric beaters.
If you like, you can enrich the cream with chopped hazelnuts or other nuts. For a sweeter version, you can replace dark chocolate with milk chocolate.
Instead of preparing the syrup, you can use pasteurized eggs.
For a lighter cream, you can add 5 oz of whipped fresh cream in the final step.
