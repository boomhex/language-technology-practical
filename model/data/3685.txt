Cut the melon into two equal parts, following the natural lines that groove it, and remove the internal seeds using a spoon ; with a melon baller, scoop out many melon balls . Cut the feta into squares of about 3/4 inches per side .
Take 12 skewer sticks and start by skewering a melon ball on one of them, followed by a couple of arugula leaves folded in half , then a square of feta followed by two folded arugula leaves. Continue skewering a melon ball and complete the initial sequence until you have three melon balls and three feta squares on the skewer, interspersed with arugula leaves. Proceed in this way until making a total of 12 skewers . If you have any leftover ingredients, you can use them to garnish the serving dish where you will lay the skewers (at least 3 per person if it's an appetizer).
If desired, you can sprinkle the skewers with a hint of mixed ground pepper, a few drops of balsamic vinegar glaze, or a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
