instructions:
To make spaghetti alla puttanesca, first rinse the capers under running water to remove the excess salt , then dry them and chop them roughly with a knife . Take the pitted Gaeta olives and crush them by pushing down with the blade of a knife .
Wash, dry, and chop the parsley . Bring a pot of water to a boil to cook the pasta, salting it to taste once boiling. In the meantime, add the oil, whole peeled garlic cloves, chopped dried chili , and anchovies to a large frying pan.
Then add the rinsed capers . Brown over medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring often, so the anchovies dissolve and release all their aromas. Next, mash the peeled tomatoes slightly and add them to the pan. Stir with a spoon and cook for another 10 minutes over medium heat. Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti until it’s al dente .
Once the sauce has cooked, remove the garlic cloves and add the crushed olives . Season the sauce with the chopped parsley .
When the pasta is al dente, drain it and pour directly into the pan , flipping it in the pan for 30 seconds, just enough time to allow all the flavors to meld together . Your spaghetti alla puttanesca is ready to serve piping hot !
