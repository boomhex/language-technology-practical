Crispy bacon adds mouthwatering, savory flavor to bacon wrapped quail , making every bite juicy and packed with great taste that stands out in American quail recipes. Golden strips of bacon hug the tender quail, giving the dish a DELICIOUS aroma that really gets attention (always a winner at the dinner table). The side of savory rice—a soft , family-friendly favorite—brings in a gentle balance, so everyone gets both satisfying protein and a mellow, easy grain on their plate. Rich color from the bacon and plump, moist quail always look GOOD together…that simple touch can turn an everyday meal into a real occasion. Kids usually ask for seconds, while grownups just enjoy how easy it is to serve a meal that tastes special and feels classic. With bacon wrapped quail at the center, busy families often find it checks those practical boxes, too: simple flavor, reliable results, and a LOOK everyone likes—no fuss, just good food that really works for any night of the week.
Family dinner plans, weekend birthday celebrations, or even a fun holiday meal…this quail with rice combo matches them all. Easy pairing with sides (think roasted veggies or a crisp salad) ramps up versatility, so you can serve it in lots of ways depending on what the family likes best. People mention this dish as one of their affordable quail meals , and easy quail dishes that don’t feel boring—a pretty powerful combo when home cooks want something dependable yet a little different. Most folks enjoy it plain, but you can always tweak the rice for more flavor (herbs or peas, maybe) to keep things interesting. For anyone looking to jazz up family-style meals without headaches, bacon wrapped quail with cooking with bacon at the core really brings both comfort and excitement— soft , rich, and delicious every single time, plus it looks nice enough for guests, too. Good for busy schedules, reliable for home bakers, and absolutely satisfying from plate to table…pretty much everything a bacon fan or quail lover could ask for!
Preheat the oven to 392°F. Take the quails and remove any small remaining feathers, then sprinkle the outside and inside with roast herbs and place a slice of bacon and a sage leaf inside each one. Wrap a couple of slices of bacon around each quail and tie them with kitchen string, then place them in a pan containing hot oil, the halved garlic, and the vegetables cleaned and cut into large pieces.
Add the sage leaves, the rosemary sprig, and ground pepper, then brown the quails well, add a pinch of salt and the red wine; let it evaporate for a couple of minutes and then place the pan in the oven.
Meanwhile, prepare the rice by cleaning the onion and sticking the cloves into it: place butter in a saucepan, and when it has melted, add the onion and rice; toast it for a few minutes and then gradually add the hot (already salted) water, cover with a lid and cook without stirring until done, adding more hot water as needed.
When the quails are cooked, remove the pan from the oven and keep the quails warm while you prepare the accompanying sauce: pour the meat broth into the pan and reduce it for about 10 minutes, then strain the ingredients and thicken the sauce by dissolving a level tablespoon of flour in half a glass of cold water, which you will add to the sauce. Cook for another minute, then adjust the salt and sprinkle the rice and quails with the sauce obtained, or bring the sauce in a separate container and allow the diners to serve themselves.
If you want to make the quail seasoning even tastier, you can add 1 or 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, which will make it darker and more flavorful, but be careful with the saltiness, as soy sauce is very salty.
