instructions:
To make the oat crepes, place the whole eggs in a large bowl, also add the room temperature milk and mix with a whisk to combine the ingredients. Then gradually add the oat flour , to create a smooth and lump-free mixture .
Now grease a crepe maker or a non-stick pan with butter . Heat it and then pour half a ladle of batter . Spread the mixture with the proper spreader tool or rotate the pan to distribute the mixture evenly (be careful not to spread it all to the edges to avoid not having enough batter left in the center to create a crepe with a uniform surface). It is recommended to perform these operations very quickly, as the batter will cook rapidly.
Cook over medium-low heat for about 1 minute until the crepe firms up and detaches from the bottom. At this point, flip it with a spatula and continue cooking on the other side for 1 minute . As they cook, stack the crepes one on top of the other . Fill your oat crepes with sweet or savory fillings!
We recommend consuming the crepes immediately. The raw batter can be stored in the fridge covered for up to 12 hours.
If you want to fill the crepes exclusively with savory ingredients, season the batter with white pepper, paprika, saffron, or a tablespoon of Parmesan cheese according to your preferences.
