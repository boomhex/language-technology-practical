instructions:
To prepare the vinaigrette, start by taking a large bowl and adding the salt . Add the white wine vinegar and dissolve the salt in the vinegar by stirring with a hand whisk. Continue whisking as you pour in the oil in a steady stream to emulsify . If you prefer, you can also use a flat spring whisk or a mixer.
Adjust with pepper and keep whisking until you obtain a homogeneous vinaigrette. The result should not be separated, but the oil should completely emulsify with the vinegar. At this point, the vinaigrette will be ready to use .
It is preferable to use the vinaigrette immediately after preparing it. When left to rest, the liquid and oily parts of this emulsion will tend to separate.
Alternatively, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Place it in a hermetically sealed glass jar. Before using it, emulsify it again.
It is not recommended to freeze the vinaigrette.
To customize your preparations, try adding a chopped mix of aromatic herbs to your vinaigrette. Use thyme for fish-based dishes and marjoram for meat-based ones.
