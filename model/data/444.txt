instructions:
To make sweet fried bread, first cut the stale bread into slices or chunks, depending on the size . In a bowl, add the eggs with the sugar and the salt .
Beat well with a fork . Quickly dip each piece of bread first in the milk and then in the egg mixture , allowing the excess liquid to drain off.
At this point, heat a layer of vegetable oil in a pan; it should not be boiling. Lay the pieces of bread in the hot oil and let them brown for a few minutes on each side . Drain the bread on absorbent or frying paper .
In another bowl, mix the sugar with the cinnamon . Coat the cubes with the flavored sugar and serve your sweet fried bread immediately !
It is recommended to consume the sweet fried bread immediately.
If you prefer, you can fry the bread in butter instead of oil, but you will need to keep the flame lower to avoid burning. This way, the bread will absorb more fat but will be even more delicious!
