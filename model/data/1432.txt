instructions:
To prepare the potato pie pizzaiola style, first boil the potatoes. Drain them when they are almost cooked and peel them. In the meantime, also prepare the sauce. Slice the onion and transfer it to a pot where you have already poured a drizzle of olive oil .
Let the onion brown, add the tomato sauce , season with salt and let it cook for a few minutes, stirring often. Add a few basil leaves and turn off the heat .
Take the potatoes and cut them into thick slices and season them with salt. Then place a 8-inch ring on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and grease it . Pass the potatoes one at a time in the flour
and arrange them inside the ring starting from the outside (10-11). Cover everything with a little sauce
and spread it over the entire surface . Add about half of the mozzarella cut into cubes and make another layer of potatoes, again passing them in the flour first .
Complete with the remaining sauce and the remaining mozzarella (17-18).
Add the grated Parmesan cheese , covering the entire surface . Add a few basil leaves and bake in a static oven at 392°F for 25 minutes. Then take it out of the oven
and wait a moment before removing the ring , being careful not to burn yourself. At this point transfer to a serving plate, garnish with basil leaves as desired, and serve your potato pie pizzaiola style .
The potato pie pizzaiola style can be stored for 2-3 days in the refrigerator.
Freezing is not recommended.
You can enrich the potato pie by adding cooked ham between the layers, or by replacing the mozzarella with smoked scamorza cheese.
