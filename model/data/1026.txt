instructions:
To prepare the savory pie with peppers and cheese, let's start with the 3 peppers. After washing and drying them, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , then bake them in the oven at 356°F for about 40 minutes, turning them a couple of times . Once cooked, place them in a plastic food bag, close it, and let them cool .

Afterward, it will be easier to peel them and clean them of seeds and filaments . At this point, cut them into strips about 0.4 inches thick ,
and let them drain in a colander for about half an hour . Then gather them in a bowl and season with a little salt, pepper, a bit of oil , the leaves of a mint sprig ,
and finally the vinegar . Mix and set aside for a moment . Unroll the puff pastry and fold it in half lengthwise .
Line a rectangular mold measuring 8x6 inches with parchment paper and place the puff pastry on top , pricking the base with a fork .
Grate the Edam cheese using a grater with large holes and sprinkle it over the surface of the pastry . Cover with the peppers arranged diagonally ,
alternating the colored strips two by two . The savory pie is ready for baking : bake in the preheated oven's lower part at 392°F for about 30-35 minutes or until the pastry is dry and golden .
Let it cool for a few minutes before unmolding it onto a serving plate , sprinkle with the remaining mint leaves , and enjoy your savory pie with peppers and cheese while still warm .
You can store your savory pie with peppers and cheese in the refrigerator for a couple of days, but we recommend consuming it immediately to prevent the pastry from losing its crispness.
Substitute the Edam cheese with your preferred melting cheese in your savory pie with peppers and cheese; however, it is better not to use those that are rich in whey, or the base might get soggy. If you like, you can also add some slices of cooked ham on top of the grated cheese: guaranteed goodness!
