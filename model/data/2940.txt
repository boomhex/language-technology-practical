Strudel lasagna is this super fun twist that Northern Italian chefs came up with—basically taking the classic lasagna flavors and rolling them into a pastry. And look, instead of the usual layers, you get a golden, crispy bread dough outside, packed with cheesy, moist ragù and béchamel inside. Imagine a savory strudel with your favorite Sunday lasagna. Looks amazing! When you slice through the warm, tender crust, you'll see the rich, creamy filling and those familiar Italian scents—so so good. This dish keeps all the comfort and flavor you expect but shows it in a fresh way.
You still get that classic ragù—slow-cooked, bursting with flavor—mixed with silky béchamel, all inside a bread shell instead of pasta. Places like Emilia-Romagna or Trentino-Alto Adige? They might serve this as a first course or a main dish at family gatherings, especially if you're trying to wow your guests with something unique. It’s lighter than traditional lasagna but keeps all the creamy goodness and that golden crust, kinda like lasagna pie or lasagna stromboli .
The lasagna pastry roll is perfect if you want something familiar yet creatively different. And, it holds together nicely, making it easy to slice for parties or just hanging out with friends. Seriously, everyone loves how the lasagna strudel keeps that Italian comfort-food vibe with a look that makes people say "wow." Whether you think of it as puff pastry lasagna or a kind of lasagna roll-up, it’s the best of both worlds—tender fillings, tons of flavor, and a satisfying crispy finish on the outside. Try this next time you want to impress a crowd and watch it disappear! It's not just food; it's an experience—tradition with a touch of innovation. For any lasagna lover, it’s a must-try.
To prepare the strudel lasagna, start with the bread dough: dissolve the fresh yeast (alternatively, you can use 3.5 g of dry yeast) in a little warm water from the total amount, along with a teaspoon of malt (or sugar). Then sift the all-purpose flour and Manitoba flour into a large bowl (1-2), form the classic well in the center, and pour in the yeast, malt, and water mixture .
Pour the oil into the remaining warm water , add the salt and mix, then gradually add the obtained liquid onto the flour .
Start mixing the dough in the bowl to gather the ingredients well , then continue kneading the dough by hand on a pastry board for about ten minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic. Shape it into a ball, transfer it to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rise in the oven, turned off with the light on, for about 2 hours.
In the meantime, prepare the soffritto, which will serve as the base for your ragù: peel a carrot with a vegetable peeler, cut it into strips, and then into fairly small cubes . Continue by peeling half a stalk of celery and dice it , finally peel an onion, cut it in half, and then into cubes .
Heat a little oil and butter in a non-stick pan, then add the chopped onion, celery, and carrot (13-14). Let it sauté until the vegetables are golden, deglaze with a ladle of vegetable broth . To learn how to prepare it best, consult our Cooking School Vegetable broth .
Add the minced pork and minced beef , cook over medium heat until the meat is well browned , you can deglaze with a few ladles of vegetable broth if needed.
Deglaze with red wine , dissolve the tomato paste in a bit of broth and add it to the simmering ragù . Continue cooking the ragù for about half an hour, until it has absorbed all the liquids.
While the ragù cooks, prepare the béchamel sauce: melt the butter in a small pot and add the flour , cook everything for a few minutes, stirring to prevent the mixture from sticking. Once the roux is obtained, pour in the hot milk and stir with a wooden spoon. Let it cook until it starts to simmer, then add a pinch of salt and nutmeg, cover with a lid, and cook over low heat for about 10 minutes, until the béchamel sauce has thickened .
Once the béchamel sauce is prepared, add it to the ragù and mix to combine everything , salt and pepper to taste .
Take the bread dough, which will have doubled in volume , transfer it to a lightly floured pastry board, and roll it out with a rolling pin, aiming for a rectangle of about 20x16 inches . Leave a 2-inch border and distribute the mix of ragù and béchamel sauce with the back of a spoon .
Roll the dough and transfer it to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cut the ends with a pastry cutter and tuck them in, so the filling does not spill out during cooking . Let the raw strudel rise again in the oven, turned off with the light on, for 1 hour. Roll out the leftover dough and cut out small circles with a 3/4-inch diameter pastry cutter .
Brush the surface of the strudel with the beaten egg and apply the dough circles creating diagonal rows , sprinkle the small circles with sesame seeds. Now you can bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 50 minutes (or in a fan oven at 320°F for 40 minutes). Once cooked, your strudel lasagna will appear shiny and golden , remove from the oven, let it cool slightly, and then serve it warm or lukewarm.
You can store the strudel lasagna in the refrigerator in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap for a couple of days. You can freeze the cooked strudel or just the ragù if you used fresh ingredients.
If you want to vary the filling, you can make a fish ragù or a white ragù with minced meat, béchamel sauce, and vegetables.
