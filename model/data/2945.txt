instructions:
The mini vegetable crumble with a yogurt topping comes from sunny Calabria in southern Italy. It's something fresh and really memorable. I mean, it’s unique in how the layers are put together. You start with a creamy Greek yogurt base. But here's the thing: it's mixed with sweet Tropea onions, cooked until they turn golden and super tender. Honestly, this blend gives it a sweet and savory note that’s way different from your usual veggie bakes. And then? You get a layer of sautéed veggies—whatever’s in season—so the flavor keeps you guessing.
Now, the top layer. It's a savory crumble recipe with chopped walnuts and rosemary, baked till it's crispy and the perfect kind of crunchy. Seriously good stuff. You get three different textures in every bite. So fresh, so light.
In Calabria, they like making these crumbles in little glass jars that seal shut. Pretty cool, right? It’s perfect for parties or picnics. And you know what? These jars keep the layers looking neat. Everyone gets their own personal serving, which is great for hanging out with friends. The mini vegetable crumble isn’t just for show. It’s an easy vegetable crumble that works as an appetizer, a light lunch, or even a fun side for dinner.
Plus, since the yogurt layer is lower in fat and packed with protein, it feels like a healthy vegetable crumble too. Definitely a win if you’re trying to eat a bit lighter. The savory yogurt sauce with those Calabrian onions gives it an extra burst of flavor, making every spoonful moist and a little bit tangy. And listen, whether you call it a vegetable crumble with yogurt or just a creative way to enjoy more veggies, this dish always brings something special to the table—really makes it a standout at any gathering. Can't go wrong with it.
To prepare the mini vegetable and yogurt crumble, start with the vegetables. Wash the eggplant under running water, use a knife to remove the stem, cut it into slices , then cut into sticks and finally into regular 0.79-inch cubes .
Continue with the peppers: wash them, cut them in half with a knife, and remove the stem and seeds . Then cut them into lozenges and then into cubes, also 0.79 inches . Proceed with the zucchini: wash it and trim the two ends, then cut it into slices and then into 0.79-inch cubes;
Do the same operation for the carrot , after peeling and trimming the ends. Cutting all the vegetables into cubes of the same size will help with cooking. Finally, shell the fresh peas (if using frozen ones, you can blanch them for a few minutes). In a large pan, pour a drizzle of oil and add the eggplant cubes and the carrots. Also add the peppers .
Then add the peas and crumble the marjoram by hand directly into the pan . Let the vegetables cook for about 5 minutes and for last add the zucchini , as they cook faster than the other vegetables. Season with salt and pepper, cook for another 5-10 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Then turn off the heat and set aside. Now prepare the crumble: in a mixer, add the shelled walnuts and a sprig of rosemary .
Add the flour gradually , the grated Parmesan cheese , and the cold butter in pieces . Sprinkle with pepper and start the mixer.
Let the blades run until a sandy mixture is obtained . Spread the obtained mixture on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, making sure to spread it over the entire surface and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 10-15 minutes (320°F for 5-10 minutes if using a fan oven). When cooked, the crumble will be golden ; remove the tray from the oven, let it cool at room temperature.
Once cool, you can break the crumble with your hands to use it in the composition of the small jars . Finally, complete the recipe by preparing the Greek yogurt-based sauce: clean the red onion, remove the outer layer, place it on a cutting board and cut it into thin slices , which you can also chop to facilitate cooking. In a non-stick pan, melt the butter over very low heat, then add the onion, sauté for a few moments, and add the brown sugar .
Stir with a wooden spoon . Cook for a few minutes over low heat until the onion is soft and caramelized. Then turn off the heat. In a small bowl, pour the Greek yogurt total 0% and add the warm caramelized onion , adjust the salt, and mix the ingredients well. Now you can start assembling your mini crumbles in jars of about 3.5 oz each; we used jars with airtight lids, which are original containers and easy to transport if you decide to have a picnic or take them to a friend's house. Pour about 1.4 oz of yogurt and caramelized onion cream at the bottom of each jar .
Then create a layer with 1.8 oz of sautéed vegetables and finally finish by sprinkling about 0.35 oz of crumble . The mini vegetable and yogurt crumbles are ready: serve them as an original appetizer !
You can store the mini vegetable and yogurt crumbles in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can prepare the mini vegetable and yogurt crumbles with your preferred vegetables or vary the taste of the yogurt sauce, for example, with mint or cucumbers.
