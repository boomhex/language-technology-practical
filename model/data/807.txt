Risotto with baby squid is truly something else, offering that classic creamy risotto texture with a dash of Northern Italian flair. Really good stuff. In places like Lombardy and Veneto, they’re known for their rice dishes. And here's the thing: this one gets a special twist with those tiny, tender calamari spillo. The real magic? Happens in the broth. You slowly cook the rice in a rich squid stock, which gives every bite that deep, moist, ocean-y flavor you just can’t get with regular broths. And the sauce? It’s not only savory but has a refined touch, with the baby squid almost melting into the rice.
What sets this risotto with baby squid apart is the unexpected herbs—pink pepper, tarragon, and chervil. Really, these add a fresh and slightly unusual edge, making each spoonful pop. I mean, this isn’t your basic seafood rice; it’s a seafood risotto with herbs that feels fancy but not fussy. You know? Pretty much.
Some regional versions pop up now and then, but this squid risotto recipe keeps the spotlight on those delicate squid flavors. While it might remind you of a standard calamari risotto, the extra aromatics and that fragrant, herb-infused rice really, really elevate it. The pink pepper offers a subtle heat and a splash of color, while the chervil and tarragon bring in a light, green freshness that's unforgettable.

To prepare the risotto, start by cleaning half of the squid (about 1 lb), leaving the others whole. Separate the head from the tentacles and remove the innards and internal quill . Peel the onion and cut it into pieces .
Do the same with the celery and carrots . Set aside all the heads and a few tentacles with the eyes removed. Heat a pot with a drizzle of oil and add the tentacles with eyes and all the whole squids .
Let them brown well on high heat, then add celery, carrot, and onion , and let them sauté for a few minutes. Then pour in the water and cook on medium heat for about 20 minutes .
Meanwhile, in a non-stick pan, pour a little oil and heat it. Add the reserved heads and squid tentacles and brown them. Turn them occasionally and when well browned on all sides, transfer them to a bowl and set aside .
Once the broth is ready, strain it and keep it warm. In another saucepan, heat a drizzle of oil, and when it's hot, add the rice .
Stir and toast it for a few minutes . Deglaze with the squid broth and continue cooking, adding more broth as needed. Halfway through cooking, season with salt .
When the rice is cooked, turn off the heat. Stir in a drizzle of oil . Add the grated lemon zest and the squid, reserving some for decoration .
Add the pink pepper and also the juice of half a lemon . Mix everything well, adjust the salt if necessary, and plate .
Decorate with the reserved squid , finely chopped chives, and sprigs of chervil and tarragon . Finish with a sprinkle of pink pepper and serve your risotto hot .
We recommend consuming the risotto immediately. Alternatively, you can store it in the refrigerator for 1-2 days at most.
The squid releases all their flavor into the broth that gives the risotto its characteristic taste. We do not recommend omitting them, but you can use squid scraps, such as only the tentacles or the mantle left over from other recipes.
Alternatively, you can use fish stock to cook the rice and grill all the squid, then add them to the rice.
