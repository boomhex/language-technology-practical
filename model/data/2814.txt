Lasagne primavera alle verdure is one of those dishes that makes spring feel like it's really showing off. Seriously good. Coming from Emilia-Romagna , this spring vegetable lasagna isn't just typical comfort food—it's a real showstopper on the table. And look, what makes this vegetable lasagna special is the mix of tender taccole (those cool flat green beans), asparagus, and fresh zucchini blossoms tucked between the layers of pasta. I mean, the pops of green and gold from the fresh vegetables make each slice look as good as it tastes.
In Italy, people love switching up lasagna with whatever’s in season, and this version is perfect for anyone who likes their food extra colorful and full of flavor. Instead of the usual meat sauce, a rich cheese fondue is spread between the pasta sheets, making each bite extra creamy and totally moist. And the sauce? No one will forget this primavera lasagna once they've tried it. The cheese fondue doesn’t just melt together with the veggies—it pulls all the flavors into one big, melt-in-your-mouth bite.
If you’re used to regular lasagna, this one feels lighter and way more fresh. It still fills you up, but all those spring vegetables give it a sort of crisp bite you don’t get from heavier versions. Which is great. Guests will be impressed, especially if you serve it as the centerpiece at a dinner with friends or family. People usually end up asking for seconds—really, really—and it’s easy to see why.
There’s something special about how the layers come together, with every forkful giving you a little bit of everything. Pretty simple. It’s a great vegetarian lasagna recipe for anyone who wants to try something new but still keep that classic Italian vibe. Lasagne mon amour! This healthy lasagna brings the taste of spring right to your table, and it’s the kind of meal you’ll want to make whenever those first bright veggies show up at the market. Enjoy it as a refreshing twist on a beloved dish, perfect for celebrating the colorful flavors of the season.
To make the spring vegetable lasagna, start by preparing the fondue: take the Fontal cheese , cut it into cubes , and place them in the mixer
and chop them . Place a small saucepan on the stove, pour in the milk, and heat it over low heat. When it is about to boil, turn off the heat and add the chopped Fontal ; mix with a whisk to melt the cheese and flavor with nutmeg ;
when the cheese has completely melted and the sauce is smooth and lump-free , the fondue will be ready. Now take care of the vegetables: wash and peel the asparagus stalks, then use a knife to remove the tough ends, trimming them; cook them for a few minutes in a special asparagus pot with the tips out of the water , draining them while still crunchy. Once they have cooled slightly, cut the stalks into slices and leave the tips whole.
Wash eggplants and zucchinis, removing the ends, and cut them lengthwise into slices 1/8-1/4 inch thick (10-11); then heat a grill and cook for a few minutes per side both the eggplants
and the zucchinis . Wash the snow peas (or you can use green beans as an alternative), trim the two ends, and steam them while leaving them crunchy . Wash and dry the zucchini flowers, then gently remove the stem and pistils .
In a large pan, pour some extra virgin olive oil along with the anchovy fillets drained from their oil; add the crushed garlic and let it all melt over very low heat. Then add the pitted olives cut into slices and the cherry tomatoes halved . Cook the ingredients, keeping the cherry tomatoes firm, then add the basil torn by hand, the asparagus stalks sliced (keep the tips for the final layer of the lasagna),
the snow peas , and finally the zucchini flowers from which you removed the central part. Turn off the heat after a couple of minutes, adjusting for salt and pepper. Finally, grate the Parmesan and Emmentaler and mix them in a bowl for a tasty blend. Do the same with the provolone and mozzarella to create another melty mix. Take a rectangular baking dish measuring 8x12 inches and brush the bottom with some extra virgin olive oil; add a ladle of vegetables and then start forming the first layer of lasagna with the egg pasta sheets .
Cover the lasagna with the sautéed vegetables, add grilled zucchinis and eggplants, cover with the Fontal fondue , the mozzarella and provolone mix , and the other Parmesan and Emmentaler mix .
Continue this way until you complete the 3 layers, and on the final one distribute the reserved asparagus tips , the zucchini flowers, and the grated cheese . Bake the lasagna in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 30-40 minutes (or in a fan oven at 320°F for 20-30 minutes). Once cooked, remove the spring vegetable lasagna from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving .
Store the spring vegetable lasagna in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for a couple of days, or you can freeze it if you used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients. When needed, you can defrost it in the fridge before cooking it!
You can make the lasagna with other vegetables, as they are suitable for any season!
