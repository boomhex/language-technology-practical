instructions:
Tagliolini timbale is a Southern Italian gem that really, you know, brings a sense of occasion to any meal. This isn't your average pasta bake—each portion is its own mini tower, giving you that golden top and those crispy edges. Seriously good. What sets this baked pasta dish apart is the white ragù , a sauce that skips tomatoes and lets the mild meat flavors shine. The ragù gets extra depth from seasonal asparagus—so so good—adding a spring-like touch that's light but still rich.
Cut through a timbale, and you'll see the creamy cheese fonduta holding everything together. Really tender. Serving these in individual ceramic cocottes? I mean, it really turns this classic into something you'd be proud to put out for guests. Pair it with an aromatic white wine from Campania or Sicily, and it's like, even more special.
Across Southern Italy, these tagliolini timbales show up during family gatherings and Sunday lunches—pretty much any time everyone wants that extra flavor and style. Each region has its twist—Campania might lean on local cheeses, while Sicily brings in unique herbs or different meats for the meat sauce pasta bake . No matter the version, it's all about taking simple ingredients and turning them into something elegant.
People love how the white ragù blends with the pasta, so every forkful is creamy and savory. The asparagus? It gives a pop of color and a fresh bite, making it feel lighter than your usual Italian pasta casserole. When friends or family see those golden-baked timbales hit the table, you can bet they'll be eager to dig in. No question.
This dish really stands out for its looks and for the way those rich, tender flavors stick with you long after the meal. Whether you call it tagliolini al forno or pasta timbale recipe, it is the kind of food that points out good company and, frankly, really good taste.
To prepare the tagliolini timbales with white ragù, start with the ragù: peel and finely chop the carrot , celery, and onion . In a large pan, pour a drizzle of olive oil, add the chopped carrots, celery, and onion
then add the chopped rosemary and a whole clove of garlic to the sauté . Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the vegetables from sticking. Also add the ground meat to the pan , cook for about 5 minutes and when it is well browned, add the white wine and let it evaporate.
Continue cooking over low heat for at least 20 minutes, adding some Vegetable broth ; then turn off the heat and remove the garlic clove . Now move on to cooking the asparagus to add to the ragù: rinse the asparagus under running water, then trim them by cutting off the hard white part with a vegetable peeler. Remove the outermost part of the stem, the fibrous one .
Bind the asparagus with kitchen twine and cook them in the special asparagus pot with the tips left out (alternatively, you can cook the asparagus in a wide pot arranged horizontally and without tying them). Once cooked, drain them and when they have cooled, cut the stems into slices, leaving the tips whole (keep at least 6 tips for the final decoration). When the ragù is almost ready, also add the asparagus to the pan , stir and turn off the heat.
At this point, make the fondue: take the Tilsit cheese, remove the rind and cut it into cubes ; then place them in a mixer and chop them finely .
In a saucepan, heat the milk and when it reaches a boil, turn off the heat and gradually add the chopped cheese , stirring with a whisk to melt it. Adjust the salt and pepper and season with a grating of nutmeg . Turn off the heat and keep warm. Take the cheese, cut it into cubes
and add it to the white ragù ; then take 4 tablespoons of ragù to use as a base for the cocottes in which you will serve the tagliolini. In a large saucepan, bring water to a boil and cook the tagliolini for 1 minute : they should be very al dente. Drain them and transfer to the pan with the ragù to toss for a few moments over medium heat, add the grated mozzarella and provolone cheese, then turn off the heat.
Oil 4 ceramic cocottes , add a tablespoon of white ragù to each . Then add a layer of béchamel sauce .
Use a ladle and a long fork to roll the tagliolini and plate them in the cocottes . Garnish with an asparagus tip ,
add the mozzarella and provolone cheese and more béchamel sauce to taste . Then bake the tagliolini timbales with white ragù in a preheated oven with grill mode for about 5 minutes . Serve the tagliolini timbales hot !
You can store the tagliolini timbales with white ragù in the refrigerator for 1-2 days covered with plastic wrap. You can store the white ragù in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 1-2 days. The ragù can be frozen if you have used fresh, not defrosted ingredients.
If the fondue seems a bit liquid, you can add a level tablespoon of sifted flour and then blend with an immersion blender.
