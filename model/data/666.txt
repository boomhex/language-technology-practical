instructions:
To make baked pasta with broccoli and bacon, first separate the florets from the stalk : after cleaning, you will get about 550 grams (19.4 oz) of florets (do not throw away the stalk: once peeled, you can use it as indicated at the bottom of the recipe). Wash the florets well under running water, then boil them for about 5-6 minutes in boiling water . Once cooked, drain and set aside; do not discard the cooking water as it will be used to cook the pasta.
Cut the florets into smaller pieces . Meanwhile, cut the bacon into cubes , heat a pan over medium heat, and when it is hot, add the bacon : sauté for about 10 minutes without adding any extra fat.
The bacon should be golden and crispy . Add the broccoli here . Meanwhile, bring the water in which you cooked the broccoli back to a boil, add salt, and cook the pasta , cooking it a few minutes less than stated on the package instructions.
While the pasta is cooking, cut the Casera cheese into cubes . When the pasta is al dente, drain it directly into the pan with the rest of the ingredients ; stir to flavor. Turn off the heat, then grease a baking dish of about 12 inches in diameter with 2 tablespoons of oil .
Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of grated Grana Padano on the bottom . Pour in a first layer of pasta , season with half the amount of cubed Casera cheese . Continue with a final layer of pasta.
Top the final layer with more Casera cheese, grated Grana Padano , and a drizzle of olive oil . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 15 minutes on the middle rack. Then grill for a few more minutes until golden brown. Remove the baked pasta with broccoli and bacon from the oven and serve hot .
Baked pasta with broccoli and bacon can be stored in the refrigerator for 1 day, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
As an alternative to Casera cheese, you can use another semi-hard cheese like caciocavallo or fontina. Do not throw away the broccoli stalk: once you remove the tougher outer part, it can be boiled and perhaps blended to make a delicious cream to dress pasta, rice, or spread on crostini!
