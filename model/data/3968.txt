To prepare the strawberry grape and cinnamon jam, start by sanitizing the jars and lids as indicated in the guidelines of the Ministry of Health at the end of the recipe. Once you have completed this operation, wash the grapes and detach the berries from the stem , put them in a large pot and add the white wine . Cook on high heat for about fifteen minutes until the berries have partially mashed .
Pass the mixture through a sieve (or food mill) and remove skins and seeds . Weigh the obtained liquid and put it in a pot, adding the same weight in sugar (it should be about 14 oz). Add the cinnamon . Cook for another 15 minutes, then add half a sachet of Fruttapec 1:1 . Stir well to dissolve the Fruttapec and let it cook for another 3 minutes. After the required time, put the jam while still hot into the glass jars you have previously sanitized, making sure to leave 0.4 inch of space from the jar's rim. Close the lids well, but without overtightening, and let cool. With the heat of the jam, a vacuum will be created, which will allow you to preserve the product for a long time. Once the jars have cooled down, check if the vacuum has formed correctly: you can press in the center of the lid and if you don't hear the classic "click-clack", the vacuum has formed. Your strawberry grape and cinnamon jam is ready to be enjoyed!
The strawberry grape and cinnamon jam can be stored for about 3 months, provided that the vacuum has formed correctly and the jars are stored in a cool, dry place, away from light and heat sources. It is advised to wait at least 2-3 weeks before consuming the jam. Once any jar is opened, store it in the refrigerator and consume within 3-4 days at most.
This jam is excellent for filling tarts and the same recipe can be followed to make jams with other varieties of grapes.
If you want to enjoy a delicious strawberry grape jam and immerse yourself in the autumn atmosphere, you can participate in the annual strawberry grape fair held in Lazio at Roccagorga, in the province of Latina, on the first Sunday of September, during which you can enjoy, in addition to excellent strawberry grapes, also traditional dishes of this season such as bean soup and wine, all accompanied by beautiful folkloric performances.
Homemade preparation of preserves and jams may present health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the necessary conditions and measures to ensure the safety and suitability of food, which, on the contrary, industrial procedures can assure to prevent dangerous contaminations. It is therefore important to scrupulously follow food safety indications to reduce risks, but it should always be kept in mind that the same food safety as professionally produced preserves and jams can never be achieved. For the correct preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
