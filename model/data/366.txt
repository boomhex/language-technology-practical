instructions:
To prepare the breaded chicken breast with breadsticks, first cut the chicken breast into strips and then into large cubes about 1.18 inches .
Move on to the batter: in a bowl, pour the rice flour and cold sparkling water . Mix well with a whisk until you get a smooth batter without lumps. Now, take the breadsticks and crush them by hand .
You should obtain a coarse breading . At this point, coat the chicken first in semolina and then in the batter .
Remove any excess batter by lifting the chicken with a fork and transfer it to the breadstick breading . Use your hands to fully coat it .
Continue this process until all chicken pieces are breaded . Heat the oil to a temperature of 338°F-356°F and immerse a few pieces at a time to avoid lowering the oil temperature. Turn them occasionally until they are golden brown; it will take about 8-10 minutes, depending on their size. Meanwhile, prepare the accompanying sauce: in a bowl, pour the Greek yogurt and oil .
Add a pinch of salt, lemon juice , and mix with a whisk until you get a smooth and thick cream . Then transfer it to a serving bowl.
When the chicken is cooked and well golden, drain it on a tray lined with paper towels for frying . Season with salt and immediately serve the breaded chicken breast with breadsticks along with the yogurt sauce !
We recommend consuming the breaded chicken breast with breadsticks immediately. Alternatively, you can prepare them a few hours in advance and fry them when ready to serve. In the meantime, keep them well covered in the refrigerator.
If you're not a fan of yogurt sauce, you can also serve the chicken with other sauces, such as mayonnaise, ketchup, or even tomato sauce cooked for a few minutes! If you wish, you can flavor the breadsticks with a mix of herbs or sweet paprika.
