To make the flatbread with ham, pecorino, and tomatoes, first prepare the aromatic salt: in the blender cup, pour the coarse salt, the peppercorns , and the stripped aromatic herbs . Blend everything to obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Now cut the pecorino into thin slices and set it aside. Remove the stem from the tomatoes and slice them lengthwise , you should obtain slices about 3/8 inch thick. Now heat a non-stick pan and grill the tomato slices on both sides .
Transfer the tomatoes to a bowl and season with olive oil and the previously prepared aromatic salt . Now heat the flatbread in a pan for 1 minute on each side over medium heat, placing the pecorino slices on half of the flatbread so that the cheese melts slightly .
Now proceed with the filling: place the mixed greens on half of the flatbread, then add the cooked ham and the roasted tomatoes . Fold in half and serve the flatbread with ham, pecorino, and tomatoes immediately .
We recommend consuming the flatbread with ham, pecorino, and tomatoes immediately.
The Marinda tomato has firm and crunchy flesh; if you can't find it, you can substitute it with slightly underripe beef heart tomatoes.
