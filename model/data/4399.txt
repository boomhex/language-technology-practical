instructions:
Yogurt and berry cups are a delicious, simple, and quick dessert to prepare. In just 10 minutes of preparation, you can make these delicious cups, ideal for a rich snack or even as a dessert. The yogurt and berry cups consist of a layer of berry coulis, a layer of sweet and creamy Greek yogurt, and a final layer of muesli that adds crunchiness to the dessert. A dessert that recalls the flavors of berry tiramisu but in a simpler and equally delicious version!
To prepare the yogurt and berry cups, start by gently heating the berries (setting aside some for garnishing the cups) in a small saucepan with water and sugar . After about 5 minutes, when the berries have broken down , pass them through a sieve to obtain a smooth, seedless coulis .
Dissolve two teaspoons of cornstarch in a little water and pour them into the coulis, placing it back on the heat for a few more minutes until the coulis has thickened (add another teaspoon of cornstarch if needed). Pour the coulis into 4 small glasses, filling them by 1/3 , and place them in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes (or in the freezer). Meanwhile, add a generous tablespoon of honey to the Greek yogurt, adjusting to your taste
and mix well . When the berry coulis has cooled, remove the glasses from the refrigerator, divide the yogurt among the cups and add a layer of crunchy muesli . Garnish with fresh berries and enjoy the well-chilled yogurt and berry cups!
You can prepare the yogurt and berry cups in advance and store them in the refrigerator until ready to enjoy!
