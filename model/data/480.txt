instructions:
To prepare the pea and carrot omelet, peel the carrots and cut them into slices about 3/16-inch thick . Clean and slice the onions .
Now, in a skillet with a diameter of 11 inches (measured at the surface, 9.5 inches at the bottom), pour a drizzle of oil and add the onions . Cook over low heat for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, add the carrots and cook for about 10 minutes, still over low heat. Add pepper
and salt . Now add the peas and cook everything together for another 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat the eggs with salt ,
pepper, Grana Padano, and marjoram leaves . After 10 minutes, pour the eggs directly into the pan .
Cover with a lid . Lower the heat and cook for about 10 minutes. When the surface is slightly soft but still moist , flip the omelet with the help of a flat plate .
Reverse the pan with a quick and firm movement, letting the flipped omelet slide back into the pan . Cook on the other side for about 5-8 minutes . The pea and carrot omelet is ready .
The pea and carrot omelet can be stored in the fridge for 1–2 days. You can freeze it after cooking.
You can use herbs of your choice. You can use pecorino instead of Grana. You can use a shallot, leek, or even fresh spring onion instead of the red onion.
