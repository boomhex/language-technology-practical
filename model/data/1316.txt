If you’re dreaming of New England, the Maine lobster roll is really where it's at. Born from the chilly waters of New England, this sandwich is a big deal—trust me—especially in Maine. Unlike the Connecticut style, which is all about warm melted butter, the Maine lobster roll keeps things super fresh and light. The lobster is boiled until it’s tender and sweet, then mixed into a chilled salad. No butter here. Plus, it's all piled into a unique New England hot dog bun that's toasted on the outside but stays soft and moist inside. This mix of textures—crispy bun and soft lobster salad—makes it really stand out from other seafood sandwiches. It's like biting into a crispy shell and then hitting that soft, flavorful inside. For those who crave a great lobster roll recipe , nothing beats enjoying one at a coastal shack with a view of the Atlantic. Pure bliss.
Many folks consider the New England lobster roll the perfect summer sandwich, and honestly, it really gives off those beach day vibes. In Maine, locals often keep it simple with just a bit of mayo, some crunchy celery, and a sprinkle of salt to let the fresh lobster flavor shine. And the variations? There are definitely regional twists. Some folks add chives, while others stick to the basics. The classic lobster roll is always served cold, making it a standout next to hot seafood sandwiches or just a regular burger. If you are used to big, saucy sandwiches, this one is more laid-back. But but still, the tangy and sweet lobster filling packs a punch. And look, in Maine, people say there’s nothing better than a homemade lobster roll with a side of chips, enjoyed on a dock or at a backyard picnic—sounds amazing, right? The golden toasted bun, cool salad, and fresh lobster create a taste that's tough to beat. For anyone who loves a good seafood roll , this is as classic as it gets and totally worth trying for that genuine taste of Maine. So... So good.
To prepare the lobster roll, first take the lobster: we used a pre-cooked and frozen lobster. Leave it at room temperature for about 15 minutes, then boil it in a pot of boiling water for 3 minutes . Drain it into a bowl with ice water to stop the cooking and cool it quickly . Extract the meat from the lobster by first removing the head .
Cut along the shell with scissors and extract the meat . Split the meat in half lengthwise and remove the intestine .
Break the claws to extract the internal meat , then cut everything into medium-sized pieces .
Peel the celery to remove the more fibrous outer part , cut it into slices and transfer it to a bowl along with the mayonnaise and the grated zest of 1 lemon .
Add the lemon juice and the chives cut into small pieces . Adjust the salt and pepper and mix to obtain a homogeneous sauce .
Pour the room-temperature lobster meat into the bowl with the dressing , then wash, dry, and coarsely chop the lettuce leaves . In a pan, melt some butter
and toast the buns only on the outer sides . At this point, cut the bun from the top along its length and open it slightly .
Insert some lettuce leaves first , then the lobster salad . Complete all the lobster rolls and enjoy them immediately , perhaps with fries!
It is recommended to consume the lobster roll immediately.
