instructions:
To prepare the horse stew, peel the onion and cut it into rings . Take the chili pepper, remove the seeds with a knife , then also cut it into very thin rings .
Place a cast iron pot on the stove, pour in the olive oil and sauté the onion for 5-6 minutes . Add the meat cut into rather large pieces and brown it well on both sides, turning it with a wooden spoon .
Add the chili pepper , deglaze with white wine , and add the black peppercorns .
Put the tomato pulp in a container and mash it lightly with a fork ; add it to the meat , then pour in the water (you can pass it through the remaining pulp) and adjust the salt.
Cook the meat for 3 hours over very low heat, covering with a lid and stirring occasionally for even cooking . After the necessary time has passed, turn off the heat and serve your horse stew .
You can store the horse stew in the refrigerator for 2-3 days at most in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap. You can freeze it only if you have used fresh, not previously frozen ingredients.
You can flavor your horse stew not only with peppercorns but also with a few bay leaves or any herbs you prefer!
