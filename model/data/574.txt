instructions:
To make the spaghetti with clams, pumpkin sauce, and mandarin mustard, start by preparing the parsley oil: pour the seed oil into a small saucepan and heat it to a temperature of 212°F, then add the parsley, which you have previously washed and dried . Blanch the parsley for a few minutes, stirring constantly .
Blend everything for 30 seconds , then pour the resulting puree into a sieve lined with absorbent paper placed over a bowl . Let it drain in the refrigerator, even overnight: in this way, the vegetable water will settle at the bottom of the bowl while the parsley oil will drip drop by drop, remaining afloat . At the end of the recipe, you will need both the oil and the parsley paste left in the absorbent paper.
When the parsley oil is almost ready, you can focus on the clams: soak them in a liter of water and 25 g of salt for an hour . After this time, shake them in a bowl and check that there are no sand residues; if so, proceed again with soaking. After this time, start to gently sauté the chopped garlic with a drizzle of oil in a pan , then pour in another 100 g of extra virgin olive oil .
As soon as the garlic floats, add the clams , cover with the lid (preferably glass) , and cook over medium heat until they have all opened. At this point, remove the clams with a slotted spoon to separate them from their cooking liquid.
Shell the clams and set them aside in a bowl . Pour the cooking liquid into another bowl, being careful to leave any residues in the pan, then add the chopped parsley , mix, and set aside .
Move on to the pumpkin sauce: peel the pumpkin and cut 200 g of pulp into cubes , then clean the leek and thinly slice the white part .
In a pan, slowly melt the butter with the oil , then add the leek . Lower the heat, cover with the lid, and gently stew the leek for a few minutes .
At this point, add the pumpkin , then pour in the water and soy sauce . Cover with the lid and cook for 20 minutes.
When the pumpkin is cooked, the weight of the contents of the pan should be 450 g . Transfer everything to a blender and blend to obtain a smooth and homogeneous consistency . Adjust the pumpkin sauce with salt and set aside.
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and pour part of the clam cooking liquid into a pan . Meanwhile, heat unsalted water in another saucepan. Cook the spaghetti for 5 minutes , then transfer them to the pan .
Cook the spaghetti alternately with the clam liquid and the unsalted water, one ladle at a time . Taste occasionally to check the saltiness and adjust accordingly on which liquid to add. Finish cooking the pasta by adding a drizzle of oil. When you have obtained a nice creamy texture, toss the spaghetti off the heat and add the shelled clams . Add another small ladle of liquid and a dash of oil , and toss again to combine, always off the heat.
You are ready to plate: spread the mandarin mustard at the base , then cover with the pumpkin sauce and place a nest of spaghetti with clams on top .
Brush the parsley paste around the cream and season with a few drops of parsley oil , then garnish with mustard leaves . Your spaghetti with clams, pumpkin sauce, and mandarin mustard is ready to be served !
It is recommended to serve the spaghetti with pumpkin sauce and mandarin mustard immediately.
You can chop the garlic in advance and store it in oil.
It is important to use a light fruity extra virgin olive oil that does not overpower the flavors of the dish.
To salt the pasta water, calculate 10 g of salt for every liter of water.
You can use the leftover parsley paste to make a delicious Spaghetti aglio e olio (Spaghetti with garlic, oil and chili pepper) !
