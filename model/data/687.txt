Air fryer tofu is just awesome for enjoying crispy tofu—without all the mess or oil. If you love easy tofu recipes , or just kinda need a break from pan-frying, this method is a total game-changer. And the sauce? Seriously good. The real trick is in the marinade. Letting the tofu soak up a spice mix gives it that extra kick, making each bite so so tender inside while the outside turns golden and crunchy. Also, a coating of Italian-style breadcrumbs adds flavor and a crisp finish everyone loves. The air fryer does the heavy lifting—pretty much ensuring evenly cooked, crispy tofu every time. And for sure, it's way way lighter than deep frying. If you’re into vegan air fryer recipes , you’ll see how much flavor can get packed into this simple, fast method—great for lunch, dinner, or just a snack.
Across Asia, tofu is made in all sorts of ways—steamed, stir-fried, or simmered in soups—but this method brings a modern, health-focused twist, often seen in recent vegetarian dishes. Here's the deal: With the air fryer, you don't need to keep an eye on the pan, and you get tofu with a crunchy shell that's perfect for salads, bowls, or wraps. Some say it’s like Japanese agedashi tofu, but with less oil. Which is great. Plus, it focuses on that light, crispy texture. It's perfect for anyone wanting more plant-based protein without the hassle. Even if you've tried various tofu cooking methods , this one stands out for how moist and flavorful the tofu turns out inside. You get all the perks of a healthy tofu recipe —fast, easy and full of taste. Really, it’s a fun way to show how something as simple as tofu can become a dish everyone wants to eat—not just the vegans at the table. With the right seasoning and that perfect crunch, this tofu will definitely be a hit at your next meal.

Mix , cover with plastic wrap and let marinate for at least 15 minutes. Then drain the cubes from the marinade .
Bread them with breadcrumbs and remove the excess with a sieve before transferring them into the air fryer basket (we used a 6-liter capacity fryer) .
Cook at 356°F for 15-16 min until the cubes are well browned . Transfer to a small bowl, add a good pinch of salt , and serve the tofu with your favorite sauce .
We recommend serving the tofu immediately.
If you don't like curry, you can omit it or replace it with another spice you love, like paprika or cumin! If you're short on time, you can skip the marinating step; alternatively, if you want to extend it, store the tofu in the fridge for even a couple of days.
