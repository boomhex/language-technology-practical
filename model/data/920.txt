instructions:
To make the white chocolate cookies, first, pour the brown sugar , cubed cold butter , and a pinch of salt into the bowl of a stand mixer.
Add the zest of half a lemon and work the ingredients with the hook. After a couple of minutes, add the cold egg yolks and continue to work the mixture for another couple of minutes. Add the all-purpose flour
and the hazelnut flour . Knead until you obtain a uniform and compact dough . Transfer to a work surface, quickly knead the dough by hand to form a dough ball.
Wrap with plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the ganache: chop the white chocolate with a knife . Pour the cream into a saucepan , bring to a boil then turn off the heat.
Pour the hot cream over the chopped white chocolate . Stir vigorously . Flavor with vanilla extract and mix for a few more seconds.
Emulsify the cream with an immersion blender . Cover with plastic wrap in contact and place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Retrieve the dough ball and place it on the floured work surface .


Roll out the dough to about 1/5 inch thickness and cut out 32 discs with a 2 3/8 inch diameter cutter . Arrange 16 discs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper .


Do the same with the other 16 discs, which you will cut out in the center with a 1 inch cutter . Bake the cut-out and full cookies at 356°F for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely, both the discs
and the cookies with the hole . Transfer the whole cookies to a tray . Meanwhile, bring the white chocolate ganache back to room temperature and transfer it to a piping bag without a nozzle. Fill the base of the cookies with the white chocolate ganache .
Finish by placing the cookies with the hole on top , pressing lightly with your fingers to even out the ganache filling. Let rest for 15 minutes in the refrigerator. Finally, decorate with powdered sugar as desired: we covered half of the cookie with a sheet to create an attractive pattern . The white chocolate cookies are ready to be enjoyed !
The white chocolate cookies can be stored in the fridge for 3-4 days. You can freeze the shortbread dough. The white chocolate ganache can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, well covered.
If you do not have a stand mixer, you can knead by hand, being careful to work the dough quickly so it doesn't get too warm.
