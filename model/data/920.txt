Lampredotto, or abomasum, is the 4th stomach of the calf. In Florence, it is called lampredotto because the name derives from the lamprey, an eel that swam in the Arno, resembling its shape and aesthetic characteristics.
The lampredotto recipe is very ancient, dating back over 100 years.
It is a typical street food consumed in a sandwich, seasoned only with a pinch of salt, pepper, and, at most, spicy oil. Alternatively, with the addition of green sauce, as we have done.
Lampredotto consists of two parts: a lighter one, the spannocchia , rather fatty and flavorful, and a darker one, called gala , quite lean. The sandwich should contain both in balance, to be perfect.
We recommend purchasing lampredotto from a local butcher.
Luca Farina is the owner of " I' Baracchino " in Castellanza (VA), where he prepares lampredotto every day. A true Florentine, his lampredotto sandwich is special, served in the classic way with only salt, pepper, green sauce, and for those who wish, spicy oil. It is loved by customers, particularly for the genuine and sincere nature of the Tuscan gastronomic offerings and his naturally cheerful and friendly manner.
