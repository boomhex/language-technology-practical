To prepare the gratinated rabbit roll with Grana Padano, start with the pumpkin. After removing the seeds and inner fibers, peel it and slice the flesh to less than 1/2 inch thickness, then cut it into small cubes ; you should obtain about 300 g (2/3 lbs) of cleaned pumpkin. Clean the onion and finely chop it with a knife .
Also chop the rosemary sprigs . If you wish, you can add the rabbit's giblets, chopped with a knife . Now move to the stove: in a pan, heat a drizzle of oil and add the onion, letting it brown for 5 minutes over low heat .
After this time, add the pumpkin cubes and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally . Add the minced meat ,
the rabbit's giblets , the chopped rosemary , and brown well before deglazing with white wine. Cook for another 5 minutes letting the alcohol evaporate .
Transfer the ready mixture to a bowl and let it cool . In the meantime, add a swirl of oil in the same pan and add the washed and cleaned greens , cover with the lid and cook for a few minutes .
When the greens are cooked, drain them and let them cool so they release excess liquid . Place the rabbit on the cutting board , cover it with parchment paper, and pound it with a meat tenderizer to flatten the meat .
Retrieve the cooled filling and add the grated Grana Padano DOP and mix. At this point, you're ready to stuff the rabbit . Place the greens over almost the entire surface of the rabbit ,
then place the filling on the greens and roll everything up by lifting one of the two sides lengthwise . You should obtain a tight roll, making sure the filling doesn't leak out. Carefully seal the two ends using a kitchen needle with string .
Transfer the stuffed rabbit onto a sheet of parchment paper, drizzle with a little oil, salt, pepper, and season with a few rosemary sprigs . Wrap the parchment paper all around the rabbit roll .
Fold the ends inward and proceed with baking in a preheated static oven at 392°F (200°C) for about 40 minutes . You will notice that the fat will drip on the bottom of the parchment paper .
Retrieve it carefully to avoid burning yourself and place the roll in a baking dish . Sprinkle the surface with the remaining 50 g (1/2 cup) of grated Grana Padano DOP and bake again for 4-5 minutes, this time setting the grill to 464°F (240°C), being very careful not to burn it .
In the meantime, pour the fat into a small saucepan along with the same amount of water and cook to thicken it . Here is your gratinated rabbit roll with Grana Padano, drizzle the slices with the sauce and enjoy .
The gratinated rabbit roll with Grana Padano, once cooked, can be stored in the refrigerator in a well-sealed container for a couple of days.
Alternatively, you can prepare it and freeze it if you have used only fresh ingredients; defrost it in the refrigerator before cooking it.
An always effective side dish for your gratinated rabbit roll with Grana Padano? Roasted potatoes , no doubt! While for a cheesy effect, add thin slices of cheese before forming the roll.
