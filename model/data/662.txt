instructions:
To prepare pasta with lard, cabbage, and potatoes, first remove the outer tough leaves of the cabbage, wash under running water, and dry with a cloth . Remove the central rib and cut the leaves into strips of about 0.4 inches . Set aside 1.8 oz for decoration.
Dice the lard , then peel the potatoes and cut them into 0.4-inch cubes . Finally, peel the onion and chop it finely .
Place the lard in a large pot and let it melt completely, then add the potatoes . After browning the potatoes, add the onions and stir for a few minutes.
At this point, cover with water to the brim , lower the heat, and cook for 10 minutes with the lid on . When the potatoes are almost cooked, mash them coarsely with the back of a spoon .
Now add the cabbage , salt, pepper , and season with rosemary .
Add about 2 cups of water and cook for another 10 minutes. Bring a pot of water to a boil, which you will use later. In the meantime, sauté the 1.8 oz of cabbage in a non-stick pan with a drizzle of oil until crispy, then set aside .
After the cooking time of the cabbage and potatoes, add the pasta and cook it by adding a ladle of boiling water at a time, like a risotto. When the pasta is cooked, turn off the heat and adjust the salt and pepper, then stir in the grated cheese and mix well . Complete with the crispy cabbage and serve your pasta with lard, cabbage, and potatoes hot !
Pasta with lard, cabbage, and potatoes can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer, you can flavor the pasta with lard, cabbage, and potatoes with sage leaves as well.
You can substitute grated Grana cheese with a stronger flavored cheese like Taleggio!
The crispy cabbage leaves can also be cooked in a fan oven at a medium-low temperature.
Do not throw away the cabbage scraps: the outer leaves are perfect for making rolls, while the central rib can flavor a great vegetable broth!
