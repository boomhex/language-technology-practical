To prepare is coccois prenas, the first thing to do is to parboil the potatoes (which will be used for the dough) for about 40 minutes, until they are soft. Once cooked, drain them and mash 40 g (1.4 oz) . Now pour the yeast into a bowl, add some of the water and mix well until the yeast is dissolved .
Now on a work surface pour the all-purpose flour and the Sardinian semolina flour . Add a pinch of salt and use your hands to create the classic fountain shape .
Add the mashed potatoes and start mixing them into the flour . Then place the lard in the center as well .
Start kneading by hand and pour in the water in which you dissolved the yeast . Gradually add the remaining water as well .
You will need to work the dough for about 5 minutes until it is smooth. At this point, place it in a bowl , cover with plastic wrap , and let it rise for 20-24 hours at room temperature. After this time, transfer the dough to the fridge and let it mature for 2 days.
After this time, start preparing the filling. Peel the potatoes, cut them into quarters, and parboil them for about 40 minutes, until they are soft. Meanwhile, pour the fiscidu cheese into a bowl and add the grated garlic . Work with a fork until smooth.
As soon as the potatoes are cooked, drain them well and mash them in a large bowl . Work them with a fork and add the dried mint .
Add the Fiscidu cream , a drizzle of oil , and a pinch of salt .
Incorporate the grated Sardinian Pecorino cheese and mix until you obtain a homogeneous mixture ; finish with a spatula to make it softer. At this point, take back your dough .
Dust a work surface with a light layer of flour, place the dough on top, and cut it into 4 pieces. Take one, keeping the others well covered to prevent them from drying out. Slightly flatten the dough and roll it out with a pasta machine until obtaining a not too thin sheet .
Now, using a 4-inch round cutter, cut the discs from the sheets . Transfer the filling into a piping bag and pipe about 80 g (2.8 oz) onto each disc . Aim to achieve a circular shape .
Now work on the closure. Slightly pinch the dough, pushing it towards the filling . Then continue pinching until you complete the entire circumference .
As you finish, place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper . Bake in a preheated fan oven at 356°F for about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve hot or at room temperature .
You can store the pastries in the refrigerator for a maximum of 1-2 days. We recommend reheating them before serving.
The Sardinian semolina flour, also known as fine semolina, is very fine-grained durum wheat flour. To make this recipe, you can use type 1 or 0 flour. If you can't find it, you can use re-milled semolina.
Lard can be replaced with oil for a vegetarian version.
The fiscidu cheese can be replaced with: casu e fittas, brined cheese, or even Greek feta, or add more pecorino. Since this is a variant, among the many that exist, the filling can also be prepared without it.
