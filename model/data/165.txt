instructions:
To prepare the gnocchi with shrimp and stracciatella, first boil the potatoes for about 35 minutes . Drain and let them cool slightly, then mash them on the work surface over the flour arranged in a fountain . Add the salt .
Add the egg as well and knead first with a fork and then with your hands until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough .
Work with one portion of dough at a time , taking care to cover the remaining dough with a cloth to prevent it from drying out. Dust the work surface with semolina and form rolls 3/4 inch thick, then cut them into pieces . Put some semolina on the gnocchi board and gently roll each piece over it . Place the gnocchi on a clean cloth dusted with semolina as you go.
Now focus on the How to clean shrimp : remove the head , remove the shell and keep them aside for the bisque. Cut along the back and remove the vein , then store the peeled shrimp in the fridge until ready to use.
In a pot, pour a drizzle of oil, add the shallot cut into 4 , and sauté for a few minutes. At this point, add the shrimp heads and shells and crush with a ladle .
Deglaze with the brandy and let all the alcohol evaporate. Pour cold water into the pot and add the tomato paste .
Cook for 30 minutes from boiling point . After this time, strain the bisque through a fine sieve and set aside. Move on to the sauce: wash and halve the cherry tomatoes .
In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil with the garlic cloves , then add the cherry tomatoes , salt, and pepper .
Pour 1-2 ladles of bisque into the pan and cook for 15 minutes over medium heat. Once cooked, remove the garlic and blend the tomatoes with an immersion blender . Strain the mixture to make it even smoother and creamier , then transfer it back to the pan.
Finely chop the peeled shrimp with a knife and transfer them to a small bowl. Season with oil , salt, and pepper .
Flavor with lemon zest and chopped basil , then mix gently .
At this point, cook the gnocchi in plenty of salted boiling water . As soon as they float to the surface, drain them into the pan . Stir and cook for about a minute .
At the end of cooking, add a few basil leaves . Plate and finish with the shrimp tartare and stracciatella .
Finally, garnish with grated lemon zest and a few basil leaves . Your gnocchi with shrimp and stracciatella are ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the gnocchi with shrimp and stracciatella immediately after preparation.
You can replace stracciatella with coarsely chopped burrata for an even richer flavor.
Straining the cherry tomato sauce will allow you to remove the skins and achieve a smooth and velvety consistency.
Before consuming raw, marinated, or undercooked fish, it is recommended to freeze for at least 96 hours at 0°F in a home freezer marked with 3 or more stars, as per health ministry guidelines .
