instructions:
To prepare country-style stewed green beans, first wash the green beans and remove the ends , then cut the bacon into strips . Heat a saucepan, preferably cast iron or with a thick base, add the bacon .
Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil . Sauté the bacon well. Almost at the end of browning, add the peeled garlic, halved and without the sprout . After a few moments, just enough time to flavor the oil with garlic, add the green beans cleaned previously . Sauté over medium heat, stirring frequently for a few minutes.
Then add the chopped canned tomatoes . Season with salt and flavor the preparation with black pepper , add the chopped leaves of parsley and basil .
Add a ladle of hot water , cover the saucepan with a lid , and let cook for about 50 minutes, or until the green beans are tender. Ensure the preparation remains moist, and add a little hot water if necessary. Serve country-style stewed green beans accompanied by toasted bread .
Country-style stewed green beans with tomatoes can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of 3 days.
You can substitute canned tomatoes with fresh, well-ripened cherry tomatoes.
