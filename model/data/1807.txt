Every December, the Sicilian sesame brittle called giuggiulena fills homes across Sicily and Calabria with that sweet, nutty aroma of toasted sesame seeds and warm honey. In Palermo, it is giuggiulena , but in other towns, you might hear giurgiulena, gigiolena, or even ciciulena. This giuggiulena recipe is a real classic. Pretty simple. It uses just a few ingredients that have been cherished for generations. It’s the kind of traditional Sicilian dessert that makes you think of a nonna skillfully working over a wooden board—rolling out the golden candy, letting it cool, then breaking it into pieces. And here's the thing, whether you see it stacked at a market stall or wrapped as a homemade gift, there’s genuine celebration in every batch. And the taste? Simple yet memorable. Really crunchy and sweet, with a toasted flavor only sesame can offer.
During the holidays, nothing quite matches the welcome of a plate of Sicilian sesame brittle on the table. Kids eagerly wait for that first crispy bite. And adults? They love sharing stories about how their families made it. In Calabria, the cubbaita recipe has its own twists, sometimes using sugar instead of honey or adding a hint of orange peel. But, you know, the spirit stays the same. This is the kind of Italian Christmas sweet that connects people to their roots, reviving memories of festive nights full of laughter. Sharing a piece of this tender, sesame-packed treat feels like passing along a bit of Southern Italian love. For sure. It’s more than just a snack—it’s a slice of Sicilian and Calabrian history. Seriously good. Families proudly keep this tradition alive. So next time you crave something chewy and meaningful, try this sesame honey candy. You’ll see why this festive treat stays a beloved tradition through the generations. Whether it’s served as a festive delight or given as a heartfelt gift, giuggiulena continues to be a symbol of cultural heritage and community spirit. And the sauce? Perfect.
For the giuggiulena, prepare everything you need in advance because after cooking it is essential to work very quickly. So start by greasing a marble surface, or alternatively, a sheet of parchment paper placed on a heat-resistant surface . Then fill a container with cold water and keep a metal spatula or a sufficiently long smooth blade nearby. At this point, you can proceed to the preparation. In a steel (or copper) saucepan, heat the honey with sugar over medium heat and stir until everything is melted .
When the mixture is fluid and boiling , add the sesame seeds and stir with a wooden spoon for 4-5 minutes. You must keep stirring continuously, making sure it doesn't burn at the bottom and especially on the edges .
As soon as the mixture is combined, golden, and more compact, turn off the heat and immediately transfer it to the greased surface . Be careful not to burn yourself; use the wet spatula to level it until you get a rectangular slab about 0.39 inches thick, and carefully even out the sides . At this point, imagine dividing the slab into 24 squares of about 1.2x1.2 inches. Place an almond in the center of each of these .
Take advantage of the mixture being sufficiently warm to cut it. If needed, you can wet the blade a little more but not too much. Then proceed by making vertical lines and then horizontal ones . Gradually you will notice that the slab tends to deform at the edges; don't worry, it will be enough to simply even them out by cutting them .
Finally, transfer the squares to a sheet of oiled parchment paper and let them rest overnight at room temperature . The next day, your giuggiulena will be ready to be eaten or gifted in food bags .
Once ready, giuggiulena can be stored for about 1 month in a glass container, in a cool place (but not in the fridge). Freezing is not recommended.
Use various types of honey to have a different taste for your giuggiulena each time. Some examples? Chestnut, linden, and eucalyptus! For a much more aromatic flavor, you can toast the sesame seeds in a pan before pouring them into the honey and use brown sugar instead of white sugar to give it an even more aromatic aroma.
In various parts of the south, particularly in Sicily and Calabria, giuggiulena, or giurgiulena , is a widespread sweet. During religious holidays, as tradition dictates, there are stalls around the city where you can purchase this delicacy. But it is during the commemoration of the dead or in the Christmas holiday period that giuggiulena is particularly consumed. You can find it in rectangles, diamonds, and squares, and it is usually garnished with almonds or sprinkles. The presence of sesame seeds, which are the protagonists along with honey, represents the great Arab influence in southern cuisine, and it's important to remember not to confuse giuggiulena with Sicilian cubàita , an almond-based brittle.
