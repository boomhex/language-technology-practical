instructions:
To prepare gnocchi with speck and toma, start by putting a pot of water on the stove to cook the pasta. Meanwhile, dice the toma cheese . Then roll the speck slices and cut them into thin strips . Finally, coarsely chop the walnut kernels .
Move to the stove and add the walnuts to a non-stick pan along with the speck and then the rosemary sprig .
Let the mix heat well until it is golden and crispy, then remove the rosemary and take off the heat . Proceed to the fondue: pour the cream into a small pan and let it heat over low flame , then add the toma cheese .
Melt the cheese by stirring continuously . At this point, you can salt the boiling water and drop in the gnocchi . As soon as they float to the surface, drain them directly into the creamy sauce .
Add the mix of speck and walnuts , a grating of Asiago cheese , adjust the salt to taste, and give a good stir. Your gnocchi with speck and toma are ready .
It is recommended to consume the gnocchi with speck and toma immediately.
Instead of walnuts, you can use hazelnuts, while aged Asiago can be substituted with your preferred grated cheese.
