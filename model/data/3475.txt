To prepare the key lime pie, start by placing the cookies in a food processor and blending them finely with its blades, then transfer them to a bowl where you will add granulated sugar (or brown sugar if you prefer); mix and add the melted butter , then combine the ingredients well. Line the edges and bottom of a 9-inch flared edge cake pan with the mixture. To do this, help yourself by pressing with your hands or the back of a spoon. Put the pan in the oven at 350°F for about 10 minutes, then take it out and let it cool completely on a rack.
In the meantime, prepare the filling cream by pouring the egg yolks into a bowl (or the cup of a mixer) and beating for 5 minutes until they become fluffy, light, and frothy; at this point, add the condensed milk and beat for another 5-10 minutes, then add the lime juice and beat for another 5 minutes. Finally, add the grated lime zest and mix it into the ingredients.
Pour the prepared cream into the cake pan lined with the crumbled cookie mixture (now cold) and bake at 350°F for 15 minutes. After the baking time, remove the key lime pie and let it cool completely, then cover it with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (better if overnight). Before serving the key lime pie, whip the fresh cream with sugar and cover the surface of the pie (except for a small part in the center) with the obtained mixture, making whipped cream rosettes . As an alternative to whipped cream, you can also prepare an Italian meringue and then cover the key lime pie in the same way with it.
John Mariani, in the book “The Dictionary of American Food and Drink,” tells us that Key lime pie appears after 1856, the year of the invention of sweetened condensed milk.
