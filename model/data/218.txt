Clean the asparagus, remove the hard part of the stalk and peel the rest of the stem with a vegetable peeler, leaving the tip intact . Cut into slices about 2 mm thick and halve the tips .
Sauté the asparagus with a drizzle of oil in a high-sided saucepan that you will then use to cook the rice . Remove them from the saucepan and set them aside .
