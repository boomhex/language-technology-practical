instructions:
To make the pasta and potato supplì, first prepare the vegetable broth and keep it warm. Start with the vegetables for the soffritto: clean and cut the carrots , celery , and onion into 3/8 inch dice.
Dice the lard as well . Peel the potatoes and cut them into the same-sized cubes . Finally, finely chop the rosemary .
Heat the oil in a large saucepan, then add the chopped vegetables , lard , and rosemary .
Sauté over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, stirring often . At this point, add the potatoes and salt .
Season with black pepper and tomato paste , then cover everything with a portion of the vegetable broth .
Stir and cook over medium heat for 25 minutes . After this time, add the mixed pasta and cover just enough with the remaining vegetable broth .
Continue cooking over medium heat for about 15 minutes, ensuring the broth keeps simmering . Stir frequently to prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottom . Once cooked, turn off the heat and add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano .
Mix well , then transfer the pasta and potatoes to a baking sheet , spreading it across the surface . Place the tray in the refrigerator.
Meanwhile, cut the scamorza into strips . After the cooling time, wet your hands and take a portion of pasta and potatoes, lightly pressing it in the palm, then add the scamorza and seal it inside to form supplì ; with these quantities, you should get about 20.
After forming all the supplì, you're ready for the breading: coat the supplì first in flour , then in beaten eggs , and finally in the mix of fine and rustic breadcrumbs .
Heat the seed oil to 320°F and fry 1-2 supplì at a time for about 4 minutes . When they are nicely golden, drain them on paper for frying . Your pasta and potato supplì are ready, serve them hot !
Pasta and potato supplì can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
The supplì can be frozen raw and then fried directly from frozen, slightly increasing the cooking time.
It's important to measure the oil temperature for frying to ensure a crispy outer shell and a stringy interior.
Remember to wet your hands before forming the supplì: this way the pasta won't stick to your hands and it will be easier to shape them into the classic oval shape.
