Get a muffin mold, preferably for 12, and 12 paper muffin cups of the same size as the mold cavities. Place the sugar and butter at room temperature in the bowl of a mixer (or in a bowl if mixing by hand) ; turn on the beaters and cream the ingredients, then add the eggs , salt, vanilla bean seeds, grated lemon zest, and finally the flour and baking powder. Once the mixture is smooth and homogeneous , stop the mixer.
Place a muffin cup in each cavity of the muffin mold, then distribute the batter into the 12 cups , being careful not to exceed half the volume; when baking, the cupcake should not overflow but reach no more than the edge of the cup. Bake the cupcakes in a preheated oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes. In the meantime, prepare the marzipan roses: with the pink marzipan, make balls slightly larger than a pea , flatten them with a rolling pin to form a thin disc .
With a small knife, cut the lower edges of the disc to form a drop shape ; prepare a total of 5 drops + two strips in the same way , which you will roll up to form the center of the rose .
Attach these two rolled pieces (pressing them onto the base) around the drop shapes to form the rose petals (10-11-12).
To form the leaves, proceed in the same way by cutting out the desired shapes from a thin oval of green marzipan using a small, smooth, pointed knife (13-14-15). Alternatively, you can purchase ready-made wafer or sugar roses that are easily available in well-stocked supermarkets.
And here is the assembled marzipan rose ! Now prepare the icing for the cupcakes by placing 1 3/4 cups (200 g) of powdered vanilla sugar in a small bowl; add 4 tablespoons of water that you've brought to a boil and stir vigorously until you get a thick, shiny, lump-free cream .
Add pink food coloring , one drop at a time, until you achieve the desired color . Once the cupcakes are baked ,
cover them with the pink icing and place a marzipan rose and a couple of leaves on each one , or use wafer roses or sugar roses. Decorate the cupcakes with silver sugar pearls and... happy Mother's Day!
Rose cupcakes can be decorated with different colored icings and flowers: unleash your creativity!
