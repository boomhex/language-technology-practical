instructions:
To prepare the pisto, pour the whole spices into a mortar: pepper, coriander seeds, cloves, and star anise , then pound with the pestle until you obtain a coarse powder .
Now add the remaining spices: nutmeg and cinnamon .
Pound again to mix well and obtain a powder . Heat a non-stick pan and toast the pisto in the pan for just a few seconds, being careful not to burn it. Store the pisto in a small jar and use it as needed.
Pisto can be stored tightly closed in an airtight jar for three months.
The toasting of pisto in the pan can also be done just before its use, to best preserve the released aroma. Coriander seeds can be optionally removed, and the amount of star anise can be adjusted to personal taste.
