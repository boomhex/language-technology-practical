instructions:
To prepare cacio e pepe ravioli, first make a well with the flour on a work surface and pour the eggs inside . Knead until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough. Wrap it with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the filling: in a bowl, put the ricotta, add the Pecorino and season with salt and pepper . Mix and transfer everything into a piping bag .
Cut the guanciale first into slices , then into strips , and finally into cubes and set aside.
Take the dough again and roll out very thin sheets , up to about 1/25 inch thick. Brush the sheets with water and fill them by neatly placing mounds of filling with the piping bag .
Cover with another sheet and press to adhere the edges well . Cut out the ravioli with the help of a pasta cutter .
Cook the ravioli in plenty of salted boiling water . Meanwhile, transfer the guanciale to a non-stick pan and cook until crispy. When the ravioli are cooked, add a ladle of cooking water to the pan and the drained ravioli , then let them flavor for a few minutes.
Plate adding the guanciale and a spoonful of cooking sauce .
Finish with a sprinkle of Pecorino and pepper . Cacio e pepe ravioli are ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume cacio e pepe ravioli immediately, but if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for up to 2 days.
Cacio e pepe ravioli can be frozen raw: arrange them on a lightly floured tray, making sure they do not touch each other, then put them in the freezer for a couple of hours; once frozen, transfer them to food bags or airtight containers. This way, they will keep for about 2 months.
Cook the ravioli in plenty of salted water, ensuring that the water does not boil too vigorously to avoid breaking them during cooking.
You can enrich your dish by adding truffle shavings, black or white, before serving.
