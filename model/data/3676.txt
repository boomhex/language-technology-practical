To prepare the pizza dough, start by pouring the flour into the bowl of the stand mixer . Add the yeast and 100 grams of water, then turn on the mixer with the hook attachment at medium-low speed .
Continue by adding the water little by little, making sure to wait until the previous amount is well absorbed by the flour . Once about 3/4 of the water is added, add the salt and continue kneading. Add the rest of the water slowly and let it work until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough .
At this point, gradually add the oil (as you did with the water) . When the oil is completely absorbed, remove the dough from the mixer and shape it with your hands into a ball . Place it in a large, lightly greased bowl .
Cover with plastic wrap or a clean cloth and let it rise in the oven with the light on . Wait for the dough to at least double in volume (1.5 hours), preferably triple (2.5/3 hours), and proceed with shaping the pizzas . Once the dough has risen, transfer it to a work surface and divide it into 4 equal parts .
Make a ball with each one . Cover with a clean cloth and let rest for 30 minutes . Meanwhile, lightly grease with a drizzle of oil 4 pizza pans of 12 inches in diameter. After 30 minutes, place a ball of dough in the center of the pan .
and start pressing from the center outward, pulling the edges slightly if necessary . If the dough is too elastic and tends to return to its original shape, set aside the pizza you're stretching and proceed with another, allowing the previous one to rest. Try to stretch the dough to cover the entire surface of the pan . Drizzle some oil on the pizza and start to top it .
Cut the brie into slices slightly more than 1/4 inch thick, then cut into squares about 1 inch on each side . At this point, coarsely chop the mozzarella on the pizza and add the brie .
Finally, sprinkle with the Parmesan and bake for 10 minutes at 392°F. Meanwhile, wash and peel the pears . Then cut them into 4, remove the core, and slice them evenly .
After 10 minutes, take the pizza out of the oven and arrange the pears in a radial pattern on the pizza and bake again for another 10/15 minutes still at 392°F. As soon as you take the pear and brie pizza out of the oven, serve it immediately .
Once the first bake is done, it is possible to freeze the pizza. Once thawed, just add the pears and finish cooking!
To make your pear and brie pizza even more delicious, you can add a handful of chopped walnuts. While the brie can be replaced with taleggio or gorgonzola.
