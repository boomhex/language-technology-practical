instructions:
To make the damson cobbler, first wash the plums, cut them in half , remove the pit, and place them in a bowl. Add the brown sugar, mix, and set aside. Now prepare the crumble: in a bowl, place the cold butter in pieces, add the flour
and quickly mix with your hands to obtain a crumbly mixture. Add the brown sugar at this point , mix and pour in the cream , mix again to absorb the liquid.
and finally incorporate the slivered almonds , mix one last time to combine . The mixture should be quite crumbly. Butter a 10-inch ceramic cake pan ,
pour the plums on the bottom and crumble over the surface the crumble, so as to completely cover the plums . Bake the dessert in a preheated static oven at 375°F for 55 minutes. Once cooked, remove from the oven, let it cool slightly, and then enjoy your damson cobbler !
Store the dessert in the fridge and consume it within 3 days. It is not recommended to freeze the dessert once baked, while the crust can be safely frozen.
Make this dessert with your favorite fruits and following the seasonality: with some excellent Pink Lady apples, for example, the result will be perfect. For a lip-smacking variant, add toasted pine nuts, previously soaked raisins, ginger powder, and a splash of rum to the filling, which will make everything much more tantalizing!
