To prepare the gorgonzola flatbread with cured ham and tomatoes, first wash and clean the tomatoes, then cut them into slices 0.4 inches thick . Place a non-stick pan on the heat, add a pinch of salt , and when it's nice and hot, place the tomato slices inside. Cook on both sides for about 3 minutes in total so that they are golden but still firm, then set them aside on a plate.
Heat the flatbread in a large enough pan for about 1 minute on each side , then transfer it to a cutting board. Spread half of the flatbread surface with plenty of gorgonzola , add the grilled tomato slices
and, finally, 4 slices of cured ham. Fold the flatbread in half and cut it into 2 equal parts . Your gorgonzola flatbread with cured ham and tomatoes is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the gorgonzola flatbread with cured ham and tomatoes as soon as it’s ready or at most within the same day.
Leave the gorgonzola at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before using it: this way it won't contrast with the other ingredients and will make the flatbread creamier!
