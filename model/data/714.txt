Swiss meringue is a classic from the French pastry world that adds a really elegant touch to any dessert. And here's the thing, unlike its Italian counterpart, where hot sugar syrup is poured onto egg whites, Swiss meringue involves gently heating the egg whites and sugar over a bain-marie before whipping. Really, it's pretty simple. This method results in a silky texture that’s both stable and glossy.
Now, I gotta say, it's a favorite among cake decorators. Why? Because it holds shape beautifully—like, super super well—making it perfect for decorating cakes, tarts, and pastries. The finished meringue has this soft, light taste that's not overly sweet. And you know, it adds a refined element to your creations.
One popular use is in Swiss meringue buttercream , known for its smooth consistency and moist texture that lasts on cakes. But the versatility? Oh, it doesn't end there. You can also pipe the mixture onto baking sheets to create Swiss meringue cookies —crisp on the outside yet tender inside. So so good.
For a touch of flair, try flambéing with a torch. Really, it gives those golden tips, adding a caramelized finish to lemon tarts or other desserts. In France, bakers often put their unique spin on it—folding in nuts or using it as a base for floating island desserts.
For those who enjoy experimenting, Swiss meringue offers endless possibilities. Like, you can try shaping flowers, swirling it on pies, or using it to explore meringue techniques . It is a sweet trick for anyone eager to dive deeper into the art of baking.
Whether you're looking to enhance everyday recipes or impress with something special, Swiss meringue brings elegance and creativity to the table without being overly complicated. And the sauce? Discover what tasty desserts you can create with this technique, and enjoy the journey of making your desserts both beautiful and delicious.

To prepare Swiss meringue, first place a mixing bowl over a pot of water. Pour the egg whites and sugar inside and turn the heat to medium. Cook over a double boiler, ensuring the water does not touch the mixing bowl, stirring continuously with a spatula and keeping the temperature under control with a kitchen thermometer. You should reach a temperature of 140-149°F.
At this point, remove the bowl from the heat and the pot of water and beat with an electric mixer until the meringue is completely cool. The mixture should be glossy and have the consistency of shaving foam and will be ready if you see peaks form when you lift the beaters. You can use the meringue in two ways. Transfer it to a piping bag fitted with a star tip and pipe 30 dollops onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper . Bake in a static oven at 194°F for about 2 hours. They will be ready when they are dry, very light, and hollow inside. Or you can use the Swiss meringue to decorate your desserts and flambé it with a blowtorch .
Baked Swiss meringue can be stored in a sealed container in a cool, dry place for about 1 month. If you use Swiss meringue in its soft form for decorations or cake coverings, you can store it in the refrigerator, but it is advisable to consume it within 24 hours.
If you prefer, you can add a few drops of colorant as the meringue begins to cool. It is preferable to use powdered or gel colorants. You can also add natural extracts like vanilla, lemon, or almond for an extra flavor touch.
