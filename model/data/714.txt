instructions:
To make Czech fruit dumplings ( knedliky ), first melt the butter in a saucepan and let it cool . Meanwhile, pour the flour into a bowl along with the egg yolk and the ricotta .
Add a pinch of salt and start mixing the ingredients with a wooden spoon, then add the melted butter and continue to mix. Transfer the mixture to a floured work surface and knead for 5 minutes until you get a smooth and firm ball . If the mixture is too runny, you can add a little flour; otherwise, add a splash of milk.
Flour the work surface and divide the dough in half, then form 2 logs . Divide each log into 5 parts and form balls .
At this point, wash the plums, make a cut on one side , and remove the pit while keeping the rest of the fruit whole . Fill the central cavity with a teaspoon of sugar , then close the fruit.
Take the balls of dough and flatten them with your fingers to create disks of even thickness . Wrap the dough disk around the plum until it is completely covered .
Roll the ball on the work surface to make it smooth and even . While repeating the same operation with the other plums, bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Immerse the dumplings with a slotted spoon and simmer for about 5 minutes, without stirring. When they float to the surface, drain the dumplings and transfer them to paper towels .
Garnish the knedliky with melted butter to taste , a little crumbled ricotta, ground poppy seeds , and powdered sugar : your Czech fruit dumplings are ready to be enjoyed!
It is recommended to consume the Czech fruit dumplings ( knedliky ) immediately.
It is preferable to use a type of dry and firm ricotta; otherwise, we recommend letting it drain to remove excess liquid.
Instead of plums, you can use any type of seasonal fruit!
