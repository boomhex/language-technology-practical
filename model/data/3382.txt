Pane ripieno di lardo e fichi is such a delicious treat. Seriously good. It really shows off the flavors of Tuscany. I mean, this Tuscan classic combines the rich taste of lardo di Colonnata with the sweetness of fichi freschi . And you know, Lardo di Colonnata is this soft, creamy cured pork fat from the stunning hills of Massa-Carrara. It adds a taste you can’t find anywhere else. Pair it with fresh figs—so so perfect—or even slightly tangy ones, and it's a sweet-and-savory combo that's hard to resist. All wrapped in a golden, crispy crust, this dish is perfect for hanging out with friends. And drinks? For sure.
In Tuscany, they often serve this as an antipasto rustico . Which is great. You get it alongside other local favorites like Treccia al pesto or various salumi. And here's the thing, what makes this ricetta tradizionale so special is how the bread turns out moist and so flavorful inside. The melting fat from the lardo and the figs' juices soak into the bread as it bakes, making each bite a blend of tender lardo, fruity pops, and that satisfying crispy edge. It's easy to see why it's a regional favorite—pretty simple really.
Serving this dish feels like inviting everyone to relax. And savor the moment, you know? Combining pane fatto in casa with Tuscan ingredients works perfectly, especially for those who love abbinamenti dolce-salato . Whether it's a casual get-together or aperitivo, this dish always becomes the highlight. Few lievitati salati from Tuscany are as satisfying as this one. It's a must-try for anyone who loves traditional flavors and the art of Italian cooking. Trust me, you won't regret it.
To prepare bread filled with lard and figs, start by making the bread dough (for more details on making bread dough Bread dough ): dissolve the yeast in a little warm water (taken from the total amount of water provided for the recipe) along with a teaspoon of malt (or sugar, if you are without this particular ingredient) . Separately, sift together all-purpose flour and Manitoba flour and place them in the stand mixer, then add the yeast and malt mixture and start the appliance to combine all the ingredients .
In the remaining water, dissolve the salt and add the oil , mix well, then gradually pour the obtained liquid into the flour, continuing to combine . Knead everything for 10 minutes, or until you obtain a compact dough.
Now transfer the dough onto a floured work surface and continue kneading with your hands for another 5 minutes . When you have obtained a sufficiently compact and elastic dough, form a ball and place it in a floured bowl, covered with plastic wrap . Put the bowl in the closed and turned-off oven, where you will let it rise for at least 2 hours. After the necessary time, wash the figs well and cut them into quarters, keeping the skin on ,
then cut 30 slices from a whole piece of lard, using a slicer (if you don't have one, we recommend buying pre-sliced lard) . Sprinkle the work surface again with a little flour and roll out, with the help of a rolling pin, the bread dough into an oval shape about 0.5 to 0.75 inches thick . Lay the slices of lard on the dough, completely covering its surface ,
then place the figs . Brush the edges of the dough with water and start closing the dough: fold the right edge inward, then the left one
and continue by folding the top and bottom edges as well . Press down with your fingers on the seam to seal everything , then place the obtained bread on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake at 392°F for 35-40 minutes. The bread filled with lard and figs is ready , serve it at room temperature sliced.
A tasty alternative could be to prepare individual portion rolls. Form disks about 3.5 inches in diameter with the bread dough, then place a few slices of lard and half a fig on each . Brush the edges of each disk with water and proceed to close them following the recipe instructions. Place the rolls on a baking tray covered with parchment paper and bake at 392°F for 35-40 minutes .
Bread filled with lard and figs can be stored for a couple of days in an airtight container. The bread dough can be frozen, well wrapped in plastic wrap, to be used later; if you don't want to freeze it, you can store it in the refrigerator overnight, always wrapped in plastic wrap, and bake it the next day.
