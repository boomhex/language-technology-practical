instructions:
To prepare the pistachio shrimp skewers, first clean the shrimp by removing the head , legs, shell , and the internal black vein. For all the details, follow our cooking guide How to clean shrimp . Get 16 skewers and thread each shrimp lengthwise with a skewer .
Prepare the batter by mixing the flour with a pinch of salt , a dash of oil , and the chilled beer .
Mix with a whisk until you get a smooth, lump-free mixture. Pour the seed oil into a pan and heat it until it reaches 356°F. When you are close to the indicated temperature, take the skewers and dip them one by one into the batter . Remove the excess, then pass each skewer into the pistachio crumbs .
Make sure the shrimp is perfectly coated . Dip 2-3 skewers at a time in the hot oil , no more to avoid lowering the temperature. Fry them for 3-4 minutes, then remove them from the oil with tongs .
Fry all the others in the same way and lay them out on a tray lined with paper towels . Salt to taste and serve your pistachio shrimp skewers hot !
We recommend frying and consuming the pistachio shrimp skewers immediately. Once cooked, they can be stored for a day in the refrigerator and then reheated in the oven.
Instead of beer, you can use sparkling water.
