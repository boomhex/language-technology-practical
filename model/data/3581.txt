To make the aromatic miniburgers with cheese, start by preparing the blend of aromatics that will mix with the meat. Pour the breadcrumbs into the mixer , then add the parsley leaves and the whole peeled garlic clove .
Turn on the mixer and keep at medium speed until you get a very fine mixture , season with salt and pepper to taste. Then, in another bowl, combine the ground pork with the sausage, previously removed from its casing . Proceed by adding the parsley, garlic, and breadcrumb mixture to the meat .
Finally, add the grated pecorino cheese and mix everything together. Once you have a well-compacted mixture, start dividing it and forming balls weighing about 2 oz each ; this way, you will make 12 miniburgers. Compact the balls well and flatten them slightly to create edges. Then, place the miniburgers on a cutting board and brush them with oil to prevent them from sticking to the grill during cooking.
You can cook the miniburgers on a hot grill for 5 minutes, remembering to cook them for 3 minutes on one side and 2 on the other or in a static oven for 25 minutes at 390°F, 15 minutes on one side and 10 on the other (in a convection oven at 356°F for 20 minutes). When the miniburgers have reached a crispy golden brown, they will be ready to be served !  Serve the aromatic miniburgers with cheese while they are still hot and present them however you like: accompanied by a mini hamburger bun and a lettuce leaf or with your favorite sauces !
You can store your aromatic miniburgers with cheese in an airtight container or well covered with plastic wrap in the fridge for up to one day. You can freeze them raw and cook as needed.
If you don't feel like using ground pork, replace it with chicken or veal. If you want to tone down the stronger flavors, omit the garlic or replace the pecorino with parmesan. Accompany them with the sauces you like most, from mayonnaise to ketchup!
