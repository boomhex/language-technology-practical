instructions:
The tarte tatin is that classic French dessert everyone loves, right? And here's the thing: this version is super special. It mixes in latte condensato plus a scoop of gelato fiordilatte with a touch of cannella . Using Renette apples—so so good for their tender and slightly tangy flavor—this dessert pairs perfectly with a rich caramel made from butter and sugar. Seriously good.
Picture an upside-down tart with a twist: the condensed milk just melts into the caramel, making it extra moist and indulgent. And the top layer? Pasta frolla bakes into this golden and crispy crust, so when you flip it, the sweet and sticky apples look amazing. Pretty much.
This isn't your everyday French dessert; it's a mix of comforting flavors with a touch of sophistication. The gelato fiordilatte paired with cannella is incredible—the cold, creamy ice cream with that spicy cinnamon hint melts slightly when it touches the warm tarte. A cozy sensation for sure.
For fans of apple desserts, this is a must-try, especially in the fall when apples are perfect. It's a great way to show creativity by combining French tradition with these innovative twists. And listen, when you serve a slice, you’ll see how the sweet apples, buttery pastry, and creamy, cinnamon-infused ice cream come together for a taste that's really, really unique.
This dolce al cucchiaio not only stands out for its flavors, but it also gets people talking and reaching for another slice. It's fancy yet feels like a homemade hug, making it the perfect ending to any meal. Honestly, can't go wrong.
To prepare the tarte tatin with condensed milk and fiordilatte ice cream with cinnamon, start with the ice cream: in a saucepan, pour the condensed milk , add the milk and cream , then two cinnamon sticks . Bring to a boil,
then let cool, then strain with a sieve to collect the cinnamon stick and any residues and pour everything into the ice cream maker . Turn it on and let it run for at least 1 hour. When it is nice and creamy, stop the ice cream maker and place it in the freezer for about 3 hours before consuming if your ice cream maker does not have built-in cooling.
Then prepare the crust: in the bowl of a stand mixer (if you don't have one, you can make the dough by hand, first working the flour with the butter, then gradually adding the other ingredients) pour the cold butter from the fridge in pieces and the granulated sugar . Then add the condensed milk , the egg and the egg yolk , and a pinch of salt; then work the mixture with the whisk.
When the eggs are absorbed and the mixture is slightly whipped, pour in the sifted flour with the baking powder . Work the mixture to compact it, then place the crust on a lightly floured work surface and handle it just long enough to form a dough ball. Flatten it slightly with a rolling pin to give it a square shape, then wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. In the meantime, focus on the tarte tatin filling: in a pan, pour the water
add half of the sugar and caramelize over low heat by often rotating the pan without stirring: you must make a blonde caramel, without excessively browning the sugar. Then deglaze the caramel by adding the butter and let it slowly melt. After that, pour it into a 8-inch diameter baking pan ,
Then peel the apples remove the core with an apple corer (or with a knife) and cut them into 4 wedges each .
Distribute them in the pan with the concave side facing up , along the entire perimeter and in the center, then sprinkle with the remaining sugar . Bake the apples in a preheated static oven at 428°F for 15 minutes (for a convection oven at 392°F for 5-8 minutes). Meanwhile, take the dough ball, roll it out into a disc 1/16 inch thick and 1 inch wider than the diameter of the baking pan;
into a disc 1/16 inch thick and 1 inch wider than the diameter of the baking pan; trim the edges with a knife , then remove the apples from the oven after the necessary time and lay the crust disc over them . Trim the excess outer part with a small knife
and pinch all around the dough to seal the crust well onto the filling ; then place in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 25-30 minutes (if a convection oven at 320°F for about 15-20 minutes). Once baked , remove the tarte tatin with condensed milk from the oven, let it cool slightly, and then flip it onto a serving plate .
Your tarte tatin with condensed milk with fiordilatte ice cream and cinnamon is ready to be served ! You can offer it in slices on a serving plate drizzled with some jam accompanied by a scoop of fiordilatte ice cream with cinnamon.
You can store the tarte tatin with condensed milk with fiordilatte ice cream and cinnamon for 2-3 days under a glass dome.
The crust can be frozen for about 2 months wrapped in plastic wrap. When you are ready to use it, thaw it completely in the refrigerator, then beat it with a rolling pin and roll it out.
Peel the apples only when placing them in the pan, so they don't turn brown excessively. If you soak them in cold water, they would absorb too much water.
