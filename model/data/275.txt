instructions:
To prepare the savory pie with ham and cheese, start with the shortcrust pastry: in a mixer, pour the flour and a pinch of salt . Add the cold butter cut into pieces , then pour the cold water .
Activate the mixer to quickly knead the ingredients , then transfer the mixture to a work surface and knead by hand to create a homogeneous dough ball. Wrap the dough ball in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for an hour.
Take the dough ball from the fridge and divide it in half . Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper. Roll out the two portions of dough with a rolling pin to a diameter of about 10 inches . Wrap the shortcrust pastry sheet around the rolling pin and unroll it over the pan .
Prick the base with a fork and spread a first layer of ham , then continue with a second layer of sliced cheese .
Add a second layer of ham and cheese , then finish with a final layer of ham only .
Now cover the pie with the second sheet of shortcrust pastry . Join the edges of the two sheets and fold them inward to create a sort of cord around the edge .
Prick the surface with a fork as well . In a bowl, mix milk and egg yolk and brush the pie with this mixture .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for an hour . After this time, remove from the oven and let your ham and cheese savory pie cool slightly before serving it !
The ham and cheese savory pie can be stored in the fridge for 2-3 days.
It can be frozen after baking.
For an extra touch of flavor, you can season the shortcrust pastry with aromatic herbs like rosemary, thyme, basil, or oregano, which will give an enveloping aroma to the savory pie.
If you don't like provolone, you can replace it with caciocavallo or fontina, according to your tastes, for an equally delicious variation.
