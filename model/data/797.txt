instructions:
To make the artichoke and sausage quiche, first prepare the shortcrust pastry: arrange the flour into a mound in the center of which you'll place the butter pieces and a pinch of salt. Quickly knead and add water at the end to finish the dough, adjusting the amount based on the dough's consistency. Form a dough ball, wrap it with plastic wrap, and place it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Dice the scamorza cheese. Clean the artichokes: remove the tougher outer leaves, cut off the tips, and quarter them, remove the inner fuzz, and place the artichoke hearts in water acidulated with lemon juice. Meanwhile, heat some oil in a pan, sauté a garlic clove and the crumbled sausage, browning for about 5 minutes. Remove the sausage from the pan and sauté the artichokes. When well-browned, add salt and cook for about 10 minutes on low heat, adding water if necessary. At this point, take the shortcrust pastry, roll it out with a little flour to a thickness of about 1/16-1/8 inch, line a greased 8-inch tart pan with parchment paper, prick the bottom with a fork, and place a sheet of parchment paper over the pastry, add weights (dried beans will work just fine) and bake blind for 15 minutes at 392°F in static mode. In a bowl, beat the eggs with the cream, add the grated Parmesan cheese, and mix. Once the crust is baked, let it cool, pour in the browned sausage, artichokes, and scamorza cheese, finally cover with the cream and beaten egg mixture. Bake in a preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes at 374°F in static mode. Let the artichoke and sausage quiche cool slightly before serving.
Once your artichoke and sausage quiche is ready, you can store it for a couple of days, but it's best consumed as soon as possible to prevent it from losing its texture. You can freeze your quiche once cooked. The shortcrust pastry can be prepared in advance and kept in the fridge for a couple of days or frozen for a month.
For a vegetarian version, you can replace the sausage with other seasonal vegetables sautéed in a pan and tasty sun-dried tomatoes in oil!
