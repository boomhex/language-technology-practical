instructions:
To make the dark chocolate pralines with mascarpone cream, start by chopping the dark chocolate with a knife , heat the chocolate in a bain-marie until it is completely melted .
At this point, brush the inside, including the edges, of the small molds . Place them on a tray and let them harden in the refrigerator for 1 hour. After this time, take the molds back, make sure the chocolate is firm, and then gently remove them from the molds . Meanwhile, work on the cream: also chop the milk chocolate ,
place it in a bain-marie until it is completely melted. In a separate bowl, place the mascarpone, flavor it with the seeds extracted from the vanilla bean and with the Rum mix with a spatula to combine.
Pour the melted milk chocolate into the bowl with the mascarpone , mix again until you obtain a homogeneous cream . Transfer the cream into a piping bag with a star-shaped nozzle and let it set in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. After this time, take both the chocolate cups and the cream, squeeze a tuft of cream on each chocolate . Once all the chocolates are filled, garnish half with chopped hazelnuts and half with chopped pistachios.
Store the dark chocolate pralines with mascarpone cream in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
For these chocolates, various fillings can be created, just mix different ingredients like white chocolate or fruit puree (strawberries, raspberries, peaches, etc.) with the mascarpone. Syrups are also excellent, as they not only give the chosen flavor but also sweeten at the same time. Try with mint syrup!
