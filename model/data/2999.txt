instructions:
If you're into flavorful and hearty bites, then, honestly, this twist on the classic Italian sandwich from Lombardy is gonna win you over—no question. Instead of just layering salami, you dive into a soft loaf stuffed with a salamella sausage mix. Salamella is this local sausage, kinda like a smoother, juicier salami. Really, really tasty. It's crumbled, mixed with sweet chili and crushed fennel seeds, then shaped, boiled, and squeezed before being wrapped in the dough. Seriously, you get a tender, spiced meat center with a touch of sweetness you don’t usually find in a traditional Italian recipe . Plus, topped with sunflower and pumpkin seeds, the crust has a nice crunch and looks rustic and cool at a picnic or snack spread.
For those who love sharing food with a twist, this easy salami sandwich is a real game-changer. Imagine biting into that golden bread crust and hitting the juicy, spiced sausage in the middle—it's a fun surprise. In Lombardy, this is a favorite for casual get-togethers or as a way to make lunch more exciting. And you know, the soft michetta bread keeps everything light and perfect for a quick meal or sliced up as an authentic Italian snack . Pretty much. It’s not your average salami panini —the filling stays moist and flavorful because it’s cooked right inside the bread. You don’t need fancy toppings or sauces; the meat and bread do all the work. Try it for a laid-back dinner, or pack some for your next outdoor hangout. Everyone loves that moment when they discover the awesome filling inside the bread—really! Whether you’re serving it as an appetizer or a main, this dish brings a taste of Lombardy right to your table, making it a unique addition to any meal. Perfect for surprising guests or just enjoying a simple, yet satisfying bite at home.
To prepare the bread and salami, start with the bread dough: in the bowl of a stand mixer or a large bowl if kneading by hand, add the sifted manitoba flour and all-purpose flour . Pour a small amount of the total water into a small bowl, add the salt , and dissolve it by stirring with a teaspoon . If you can't find manitoba flour, you can only use all-purpose flour, but be careful to choose one that contains at least 11% protein, you can check this information by reading the product characteristics on the package. Both all-purpose and manitoba flour have a high gluten content, but they differ in their degree of refinement.
In the rest of the water, dissolve the malt (or alternatively a teaspoon of sugar), dried yeast (alternatively, you can use 12.5 g of fresh yeast), and finally the extra virgin olive oil , mixing well to combine all the ingredients. You can also prepare the bread dough with sourdough: replace the yeast with about 200 g of sourdough and increase the rising times by 3-4 hours.
Attach the flat beater to the stand mixer, and once turned on, first add the water containing the malt, yeast, and oil and then start kneading at medium speed, if kneading by hand, gather the ingredients firmly. After 1 minute, also add the water in which you dissolved the salt , continuing to knead. When the mixture has gathered around the beater, replace it with the dough hook and continue kneading at medium-low speed for at least 5 minutes, until the dough is smooth and homogeneous.
After this time, pour a little oil on a work surface , so you can knead without adding flour, then transfer the dough there and start working it with your hands, shaping it into a round shape (11-12).
Then oil a bowl using a brush and transfer the dough there , cover it with plastic wrap and let it rise for at least two hours at room temperature between 82°F and 86°F, or until it doubles in size.
Meanwhile, focus on the filling: first, fill a pot with a diameter of about 10 inches with water and bring it to a boil. The size of the pot is important because it must hold the sausage entirely. Then place the fennel seeds on a cutting board and finely chop them with a knife or even with a coffee grinder . Then cut the surface of the sausages, crumble them in a bowl , and add the sweet red chili powder . You can use sausage instead of salamella, even the one typical of your area or salami paste. Also, flavor it as you prefer: with spices or aromatic herbs or replacing the chili with sweet paprika.
After adding the crushed fennel seeds, mix everything by hand for 5 minutes , then oil the work surface again and transfer the mixture there, working it by hand to form a cylindrical sausage about 8 inches long . Then get a muslin or a clean kitchen towel and place the sausage on top .
Wrap the sausage tightly , securing the ends with cooking twine and transfer it to the pot with boiling water, cook for 10 minutes . The water should simmer and not boil turbulently, otherwise it will ruin the salami.
Once cooked, drain the sausage on a rack , with a plate placed underneath, and squeeze it by tightening the edges of the muslin , so that the excess water and fat are expelled. Then open the muslin or towel in which you wrapped the mixture and let it cool at room temperature . It is important that the filling does not cool completely but reaches room temperature, otherwise, the dough might not rise correctly.
Meanwhile, take the risen bread dough and transfer it to a slightly oiled surface to prevent sticking. Oil your hands if necessary and roll it out, giving it a rectangular shape and a thickness of about 0.75 inches . Place the filling in the center of the obtained rectangle and roll the dough over it , tucking in the ends on the side of the seal.
Now butter and line with baking paper a 10x5 inch loaf pan and place the bread and salami with the dough seal facing down so the dough pushes upwards .
Brush the surface with a beaten egg and sprinkle with sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds to taste, pressing them to adhere well to the surface. If you like, you can also top your bread and salami with sesame or poppy seeds. Otherwise, leave it plain and add a few drops of milk to the beaten egg for a more golden surface.
Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let it rise for at least 1 hour at room temperature, until the dough reaches the edge of the pan. When the dough is puffy and soft , remove the plastic wrap and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 45 minutes, if using a fan oven, bake at 320°F for about 35 minutes. Once baked, remove it by pulling on the edges of the baking paper and let it cool on a rack. Your bread and salami is ready to be sliced and enjoyed during a picnic or as an appetizer!
Store the bread and salami in the fridge well covered with plastic wrap for 4-5 days. You can then eat it cold or warm it slightly in the oven. Bread and salami can be frozen when already cooked, let it thaw in the fridge 3 hours before consuming.
A thousand and one variations for this bread: it could be bread and salami, but also bread and sausage, perhaps the one typical of your region, flavored and seasoned with hot chili instead of sweet chili or paprika... Again: why not wrap the filling with cheese slices, to form a soft and meltable intermediate cushion, or sprinkle everything with poppy or sesame seeds?
