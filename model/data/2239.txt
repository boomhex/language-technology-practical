instructions:
To prepare the baked fritters, start by making the batter. Pour the slightly beaten eggs into the bowl of a stand mixer, add the sugar , and start whipping with the beaters . Meanwhile, grate the lemon zest
and add it to the eggs . When they are fluffy and foamy, also add the anise and the milk in a stream , both at room temperature.
At this point, in another bowl, sift together the flour and the baking powder , then incorporate the dry ingredients one spoonful at a time with the stand mixer running at moderate speed .
Once you have a smooth and homogeneous batter , transfer it into a glass bowl . Using two spoons, place 0.9 oz of batter into each half-sphere of the mold ; we used a mold where each half-sphere has a diameter of 2 inches.
Once the sections are filled , bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 25 minutes (if using a convection oven, bake at 320°F for about 15 minutes). Only when they are baked, remove from the oven and let your baked fritters cool slightly before unmolding them and dusting with powdered sugar .
The baked fritters can be stored for 1-2 days under a glass dome; to enjoy their softness again, it's advisable to warm them up in the oven for a few minutes! Freezing is not recommended.

Flavor your baked fritters with orange zest or vanilla beans.
If you prefer, you can also fry them!
