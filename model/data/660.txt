instructions:
To prepare the potato croquettes, wash the potatoes under running water and boil them with the peel on in salted water: to ensure even cooking, use potatoes of the same size as much as possible. Once cooked, (for medium-sized potatoes, it will take 15-20 minutes in a pressure cooker and about 40 minutes in traditional boiling) let them cool slightly (just enough to handle them) and then peel them by piercing them with a fork and removing the skin with a small knife.
Pass them through a potato ricer while still hot and collect the puree in a bowl, separately beat the egg yolks with pepper and salt (consider that 30 g of yolks correspond to the yolks of 2 medium eggs) then add them to the potatoes
flavor with grated nutmeg and season with grated cheese , mix with a spoon to combine the ingredients until you get a soft and dry mixture. Use a spoon to take a portion of about 1.25 oz of dough and shape the croquettes into a cylindrical form.
As you form the croquettes, place them on a tray lined with parchment paper . With the indicated dose, you will get about 30 croquettes. Once the dough is finished, bread the croquettes: prepare two bowls respectively with the two beaten eggs and breadcrumbs, now dip them first in the egg and then in the breadcrumbs
Place the breaded croquettes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, drizzle them with a bit of olive oil . Place the croquettes in the fridge for 15 minutes so they maintain their shape during cooking and bake the croquettes in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 10 minutes, then continue cooking for another 5 minutes with the grill. At the end of cooking, remove your baked potato croquettes , let them cool slightly, and then serve them hot !
It's recommended to consume the baked potato croquettes once ready; if desired, you can freeze them raw and then cook them directly from frozen.
In the fridge, you can store them for 1 day and reheat as needed.
Fill the croquettes with tasty ingredients: olives, bacon cubes, or melty cheese, they will be even more irresistible!
Serve the croquettes with a fresh and aromatic homemade sauce made with plain yogurt emulsified with oil, salt, pepper, and garnished with fresh chili pepper and mint!
