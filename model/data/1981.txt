Brioche rolls in Italy—girelle di pan brioche—are seriously a game-changer. They turn classic rolls into these soft, sweet spirals. Perfect any time of day. And really, they're loved all over Italian homes. And the fillings? Nutella and creamy cheese make the centers so so tender and moist. Unlike the French, Italians focus on richness—melt-in-your-mouth kind of stuff.
The dough's usually for loaves, but you know, Italians get super creative. They make sweet rose buns or even big spiral cakes stuffed with pastry cream. Pretty much anything goes. It’s all about making something special, but still easy for breakfast or those mid-morning coffee breaks, you know?
Families love this dish. It's fun and golden. Plus, if you’re into experimenting with flavors and shapes, homemade brioche rolls are your jam. Different regions add their own twists—some go all out with Nutella, others with jam or custard for that extra richness. That slightly crispy outside, giving way to a super soft inside, is indulgence done right—without going overboard.
And here's the thing: the dough's versatility is a win. But you can shape or fill your brioche dinner rolls however you like. Roll them into a cake or make mini buns for snacks—your call. That pan brioche taste? Always shines through—making these a favorite at Italian breakfast tables.
For baking enthusiasts, these spirals are a playground. Super fun and definitely rewarding. It's why Italian home cooks keep coming back to them. Really, anytime they want something sweet and special. Whether you’re a seasoned baker or just starting out, these treats will bring a touch of joy to your kitchen. For sure. And listen, you can’t go wrong with these.
To prepare the pan brioche swirls, start by making the basic dough. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, first add the flour , then the sugar , and the crumbled yeast .
Start working the mixture at moderate speed. Add the milk and, as soon as it is completely absorbed, also incorporate the slightly beaten eggs . Add the salt and continue to work at medium speed.
At this point, add the softened butter little by little , waiting for each piece to be absorbed before adding the next, and work until the dough is smooth and compact . The dough processing with the mixer will take about 15-20 minutes. Then transfer it to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap , and let rise for at least an hour.
As soon as the dough has doubled in volume, remove the plastic wrap and transfer it to a lightly floured work surface . Begin to roll it out with a rolling pin
until you get a 12x16 inch rectangle of dough . Then, with a knife, divide it in half lengthwise . Add the cream cheese to one of the two halves
and spread it over the entire surface using the back of a spoon . Do the same with the Nutella, spreading it over the layer of cream cheese . Then gently and quickly lift the second strip of dough and place it on top .
At this point trim the edges with a knife . Then cut strips about 1 inch wide ; you should get 8 of them.
Butter a muffin tin and preheat the oven to 355°F. Space out the strips of dough to work more easily and twist them on themselves .
After twisting them, roll them up as if they were swirls . Gradually transfer them into the muffin tin and bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for about 20 minutes on the lower rack. Remove from the oven and enjoy your pan brioche swirls!
Store the pan brioche swirls at room temperature under a glass dome. Consume them within a couple of days of preparation. If you prefer, you can store the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Alternatively, you can freeze the raw swirls and let them thaw before baking.
After spreading the Nutella, sprinkle with a shower of hazelnut crumbs! We recommend using cream cheese to ensure softer swirls.
