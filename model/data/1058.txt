instructions:
To prepare the Chicken alla Norma, first cut the chicken breast into cubes , then flour them , removing the excess flour by sifting with a strainer .
Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan , add the floured chicken bites and brown them for 4-5 minutes on all sides .
Set them aside and in the same pan add a clove of garlic and a drizzle of oil .
Pour in the canned tomatoes , mash them with a fork , season with basil leaves .
Cover with the lid and cook on low heat for 30 minutes. In the meantime, wash and trim the eggplants, then slice them lengthwise and cut them into strips in one direction
and then the other, to obtain cubes about 1 cm . Heat the seed oil in a small pot and when it reaches 340°F, immerse the eggplant cubes . Cook for a few minutes until golden, then drain them .
Place them on a tray lined with absorbent paper or for frying . After the 30 minutes of sauce cooking, remove the garlic and add the chicken bites , salt and pepper, and cook for another 10-15 minutes on low heat without a lid.
Turn off the heat and add the fried eggplants , grate the salted ricotta and mix to flavor. Serve the Chicken alla Norma while hot .
If you prefer, you can prepare the sauce the day before, while it is advisable to cook the chicken at the moment. Once cooked, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 days in an airtight container. You can also freeze Chicken alla Norma if you have used fresh and not defrosted products.
Chicken alla Norma is already fabulous as it is... for a variation you could use fresh cherry tomatoes instead of canned ones!
