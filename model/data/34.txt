To prepare pasta with prawns, first clean the crustaceans: remove the head and the shell and set them aside, then remove the intestine by making an incision on the back .
In a pan, flavor some oil with garlic for a few minutes , then add the prawn heads and shells . Sauté well, then deglaze with white wine .
When the alcohol has evaporated, strain the cooking base through a fine-mesh sieve . Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and add them to the same pan with a drizzle of oil .
Salt , then add the crustacean cooking base and tomato paste . Cook for 10 minutes over medium heat.
Meanwhile, cook the pasta in plenty of salted water . Drain it al dente directly into the pan , then add a ladle of cooking water and a drizzle of oil .
Flavor with chopped parsley and mix well. Finally, add the shelled prawns and continue cooking for another couple of minutes. Plate the spaghetti with prawns .
Add more sauce and chopped parsley to taste . Your pasta with prawns is ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the pasta with prawns just prepared; if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator for up to one day in an airtight container.
Try adding some lemon zest at the end of cooking for a touch of freshness!
