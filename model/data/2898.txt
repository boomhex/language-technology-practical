Pavlova al caffè is something that really stands out at special events, especially when you're aiming for something different from the usual cakes and pies. I mean, really different. Originating from Australia and New Zealand , this sweet treat was whipped up to honor the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova. And here's the thing—what makes this pavlova al caffè special is its twist: a crisp coffee-flavored meringue paired with a creamy chocolate-coffee filling. Instead of the usual fresh fruit topping, this version goes all in with rich chocolate and a punch of espresso. Can't go wrong. The way it melts in your mouth is amazing, with a mix of crunchy meringue and smooth whipped cream, plus that hint of coffee really wakes up your taste buds. It’s the kind of dessert al caffè that makes people stop and ask for seconds. For sure.
While the classic pavlova is already pretty impressive, this ricetta pavlova al caffè takes it to another level. Seriously good. The coffee in the meringue adds a light bitterness that plays off the sweet chocolate cream, making each bite a delicious mix of different flavors and textures. People often save this for birthdays, holidays, or any occasion where you want to impress a crowd—it always gets folks talking. And look, the best part is how easy it is to make the meringue golden and crunchy on the outside, yet tender in the middle. Plus, the coffee aroma really fills the kitchen. A pavlova al caffè facile doesn’t require as much work as you’d think, but it sure looks fancy when you bring it to the table. It’s a dish you can experiment with too, maybe adding a dash of cocoa powder or more espresso if you want that coffee flavor to really really shine. Whether you’re a fan of the pavlova con crema al caffè or just love trying new sweets, this one feels like a win every time, especially when you see how fast it disappears at any get-together. It's a satisfying treat that keeps everyone coming back for more.
To prepare the coffee pavlova, start by making coffee with the moka pot: pour cold water, preferably low in limescale, into the boiler up to the safety valve (otherwise you'll get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee and level with each teaspoon of coffee added by tapping the filter on the table with decisive movements , until you reach the edge of the filter.
Do not press with the teaspoon, do not make holes, and screw the coffee maker tightly (to prevent coffee from leaking out the sides while it rises), then place it on a low and constant flame to obtain a full-bodied coffee. As the coffee rises, a dense foam will form ; we recommend not letting the coffee bubble too long to preserve its aroma and sweetness. Then turn off the heat and your coffee for preparation is ready: mix it directly in the moka with a teaspoon to make it more homogeneous .
Preheat the oven (static) to 482°F. Now focus on the meringue: take the room temperature eggs and separate the whites from the yolks. With a hand mixer or stand mixer, whip the egg whites adding the salt. When they become white, add the baking powder; then, still whipping, add 10 ml of previously prepared moka coffee . In another bowl, combine the sugar with the cornstarch and add the mixture to the eggs one tablespoon at a time , while the beaters are still running, until all the ingredients are combined.
Finally, add the vinegar (apple or white wine) in a couple of additions . You should obtain a creamy and firm mixture that you will spread on a baking tray lined with a sheet of baking paper, forming a fairly thick disc with slightly raised edges . At this point, set the oven to 248°F, bake the meringue, and let it cook for about 1 hour and a half in a static oven. After the necessary time, turn off the oven, slightly open the door, and let the pavlova base cool completely; you should obtain a golden meringue .
Now focus on the sauce: place a small pan with 1/4 cup of cream on the stove and heat it on low heat, add the 1/4 cup of coffee prepared with the moka and the dark chocolate pieces . Stir until all the chocolate is melted, obtaining a smooth, lump-free cream , and let it cool slightly.
Pour the obtained sauce in the center of the pavlova . Meanwhile, whip 1 2/3 cups of liquid cream with 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar and fill the surface of the cake with generous spoonfuls of cream
completely covering the cake . Finally, garnish with chocolate curls , place the leftover chocolate sauce in a piping bag to finish decorating the pavlova . Your pavlova is ready to be served!
Store the pavlova in the refrigerator for up to a couple of days.
You can garnish the pavlova with white chocolate curls or a dusting of powdered sugar.
