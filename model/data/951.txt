instructions:
To prepare the pasticciotto cake, first make the shortcrust pastry. On a work surface, sift the flour and form the classic well shape. Place the lard in the center and quickly work with your hands to obtain a sandy mixture .
Form the well again and pour the sugar in the center , the seeds from half a vanilla bean, a pinch of salt
and two egg yolks . Then knead with your hands , and when you have obtained a homogeneous mixture, form a dough ball
and wrap it in plastic wrap . Transfer to the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the custard. Heat the milk in a saucepan with the vanilla bean and seeds . In the meantime, place 3 egg yolks and sugar in a bowl
and the flour . With the help of a whisk, beat well to obtain a combined and slightly whipped mixture . When the milk is about to boil, turn off the heat, pour the whipped yolks with the sugar and flour
and stir with a whisk . Turn the burner back on at low heat and stir for a few minutes until the cream thickens . Once the cream has thickened, transfer it to a bowl, remove the vanilla bean ,
cover with cling film in contact with the surface and let it cool. When the cream is at room temperature and the pastry has rested, take the pastry dough, extract a third and set it aside. Take the larger part and roll it out with a rolling pin , you should obtain a 9.5-inch disc, about 0.4 inches thick.
Use the dough to line a 8-inch round pan; being larger, you will have no difficulty covering the edges well. With the help of a knife, remove the excess pastry that extends beyond the pan . Pour the custard inside and level it with the back of a spoon.
Then arrange the syrupy black cherries, spacing them out . Take the reserved pastry and roll it out to get a 7-inch disc, about 0.4 inches thick. Place it in the center of the cake and fold over the edges of the lower layer, sealing them with your fingers .
When you have finished , brush the surface with milk and bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for about 50 minutes. Once cooked, remove from the oven and let the pasticciotto cake cool completely in the pan before removing it and serving.
Store the pasticciotto cake in the refrigerator for a maximum of 2-3 days.
The shortcrust pastry can be frozen for about 1 month wrapped in cling film.
It should then be thawed and left to rest at room temperature for an hour before working it.
Instead of the vanilla bean, you can use lemon zest to flavor both the cream and the pastry.
If you have difficulty working with the pastry, you can add an egg white and then roll the dough directly onto a sheet of parchment paper.
