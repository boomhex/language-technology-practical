Note FROM THE EDITORS: If you don't have a meat grinder, ask the butcher to grind the chicken thighs in the quantity indicated in the recipe. For preparation times, consider letting the mixture rest in the fridge (at least 30 minutes)

instructions:
To prepare chicken burgers, first remove the skin from your thighs. Set aside one piece for the recipe. Insert the chicken thighs and the reserved skin into the mincer; it will add some fattiness to the burgers.
Gather the minced meat in a large bowl . If you don't have a mincer at home, you can ask the butcher to perform this operation. Then add the grated Grana Padano PDO, chopped rosemary , white wine ,
soy sauce , and mustard . Season with pepper and add a drizzle of oil .
Mix the ingredients until you get a homogeneous mixture . Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least half an hour ; this way, the flavors will blend, and the mixture will become firmer. After the resting time, start forming the burgers. First, line a cutting board with parchment paper, then take 6.3 oz of mixture and round it with your hands .
Then place it on the parchment paper and gently press to flatten it , then shape the burger with both hands to get the correct form . Prepare all the burgers this way; you will get 6 with these amounts. .
Now you just have to cook the burgers. Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan and place the burgers inside. Adjust the salt and cook over medium heat for 8-9 minutes. When they are nicely golden, flip them and continue cooking for another 8-9 minutes, being careful not to overcolor them . Adjust the salt again and serve your chicken burgers !
Once cooked, we recommend consuming the chicken burgers immediately, as reheating them might make them too dry.
You can store them in the fridge for 2 days, well wrapped in plastic wrap, or freeze them.
You can season your chicken burgers as you like. Instead of mustard, you can use barbecue sauce, and instead of soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce or herb salt. We used thighs because they are one of the fattier parts of the chicken; if you prefer to use the breast, consider that being very lean, it might result in a drier final product.
It is not advisable because minced meat has a different texture from blended meat, which turns into a mush.
Definitely, but you need to ensure that the cooking is done properly, especially in the middle.
Get a good non-stick pan, or you can place a sheet of parchment paper on the bottom.
