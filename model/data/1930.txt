instructions:
To prepare the soft ricotta and pear cake, start by peeling the pears, remove the core, and cut them into rather small cubes . Place them in a bowl with a little lemon juice to prevent them from browning. Beat the sugar with the ricotta using a whisk (or in a stand mixer) , then add the seeds of the vanilla pod. Incorporate the 3 eggs one by one and continue whipping the mixture,
add the grated lemon zest . Sift the flour with the baking powder and add them to the mixture , stirring with a wooden spoon until you get a smooth batter. Incorporate the cubed pears
and blend them into the batter . Grease and flour a 9.5-inch springform pan , pour the cake batter into it, and level it well with a spatula . Then bake the cake at 350°F (static oven) for 50-70 minutes, until a wooden skewer inserted in the center of the cake comes out dry. If the cake becomes too dark on the surface during baking, cover it with a sheet of aluminum foil. Remove the soft ricotta and pear cake from the oven, let it cool slightly, unmold it, and sprinkle it with powdered sugar before serving!
The soft ricotta and pear cake keeps for 2-3 days under a glass dome.
If you wish, you can freeze the cake once it is baked and cooled.
To make the soft ricotta and pear cake even more delicious, you can add 3.5 oz of dark chocolate chips to the batter!
