instructions:
To prepare the savory pie with salami and zucchini flowers, start with the leavened dough: in a bowl, pour the flour, yeast , water , and start kneading by hand .
When the ingredients are combined, first incorporate the salt and then the oil slowly . Finish the kneading phase on the work surface until the oil is completely absorbed .
Create a smooth and homogeneous sphere and place it in an oiled bowl, covering it with plastic wrap . Let it rise for about 2 hours, or until the dough has doubled, under a wool blanket or at a constant temperature of 79-82°F .
In the meantime, cut the cheese and salami into cubes about 0.2 inches each. Lastly, clean the zucchini flowers by cutting the base .
When the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and roll it out with a rolling pin to obtain a rectangle about 27.5 inches long and 11.8 inches wide . Sprinkle with a little pepper .
Leave a couple of centimeters from the edges and pour the cheese and salami cubes in the middle , finally open the zucchini flowers in half and cover the dough .
Close the short side over itself from one side and the other and start rolling the long side .
You'll get a nice thick roll and then roll it up to form a snail shape . Transfer to a 9-inch mold with parchment paper at the base and greased around the circumference . Cover with a clean cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
After the time has passed, brush the surface with mixed egg yolk and a splash of milk , sprinkle with poppy seeds, and proceed with baking : the savory pie with salami and zucchini flowers bakes in a static oven, already hot at 356°F, for about 45 minutes. Enjoy it warm.
The savory pie with salami and zucchini flowers keeps in the fridge covered for 2/3 days.
If you prefer, you can also freeze it cooked or raw once rolled and before the last rise.
Add aromatic herbs to your liking inside the roll, oregano and fennel work very well! For the surface, you can also use some crushed nuts like hazelnuts or walnuts.
