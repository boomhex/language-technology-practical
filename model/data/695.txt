instructions:
To prepare the pumpkin focaccia, start with the pumpkin itself. Remove the outer skin using a peeler . Cut the pumpkin into slices and remove any seeds. You will need to obtain 10.5 oz of flesh and cut it into cubes . Transfer the pumpkin to a steamer and cook it for about 20 minutes.
Check the cooking by pricking the pumpkin with a fork until it's soft enough . Transfer it to a blender and add the water .
Blend until you get a puree . In a large bowl, pour the 2 types of flour and add the dry yeast .
Also add the olive oil , the sugar , and the pumpkin puree .
Mix with a spoon until the ingredients are combined . Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 15 minutes at room temperature .
Then take the dough again and mix it again with a spatula. Add the salt and continue to knead in the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and form a round dough ball by giving some reinforcing folds .
Transfer the dough ball to rise in the previously used bowl, still oiled . Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise until doubled . It will take about 5 hours in a warm, draft-free place. Once risen, take the dough and transfer it inside a 10x12 inch rectangular pan lined with oiled parchment paper. Spread the dough with your hands until it covers the entire surface .
Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for another hour. Sprinkle the surface with rosemary needles and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 30 minutes, on the middle shelf, or until golden both at the base and on top. Remove from the oven , let it cool slightly, and serve!
It can be stored wrapped in plastic wrap for 2 days at room temperature. It can be frozen in food bags
Instead of dry yeast, you can use 4-5 grams of fresh yeast.
Changing the variety of pumpkin may require adjusting the flour amount based on the dough's consistency.
