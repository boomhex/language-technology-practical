instructions:
To prepare baked pasta with spinach and ricotta, heat a little oil in a pan, then clean and thinly slice the spring onion before adding it to the pan to stew over low heat .
Add the washed spinach leaves and cook over high heat for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and adjust with salt and pepper. Transfer the cooked spinach to a tall glass, add a little extra virgin olive oil, and blend with an immersion blender .
Once a smooth cream is obtained, add the peeled almonds and blend again . Keep the spinach and almond cream aside at room temperature until use .
In a bowl, pour the ricotta, add the thyme leaves, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and mix . Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling water, salted to taste . Drain the pasta al dente in a large bowl, add the spinach cream , and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
Incorporate also half of the ricotta . Mix and transfer half of the dressed pasta into a baking dish , add a few dollops of ricotta , and cover with the remaining pasta.
Finish with the remaining ricotta dollops, grated Parmesan, a drizzle of oil , pepper, and almond flakes . Bake in a preheated fan oven at 392°F for about 15 minutes (or until the surface is golden). Remove from the oven, let it cool slightly, and serve your baked pasta with spinach and ricotta .
Baked pasta with spinach and ricotta can be stored for 2 days in the refrigerator.
Freezing is not recommended.
For a smoother cream, choose tender spinach leaves.
Try adding a more tantalizing touch by including sun-dried tomatoes in oil to the spinach and blending everything together.
If the ricotta has a lot of whey, we recommend draining it well before use.
