Soffioni Abruzzesi are those amazing treats that folks from Abruzzo love to have on their Easter table. But honestly, they’re welcome any time. These Italian ricotta pastries are like little puffs—hence the name "soffioni." It's all about how the filling gets fluffy and spills out while baking. And look, what makes them different from other traditional Abruzzo desserts is their dough. Instead of butter, they use oil. Pretty simple, right? This keeps everything a bit lighter and still tender, almost like a shortcrust pastry but softer.
The inside is the real star, though: a mix of sheep ricotta and eggs that turns moist and almost creamy when baked. Some families in L’Aquila toss in a pinch of saffron, adding a gentle warmth. Others from nearby areas might slip in a few raisins for a little sweet surprise. In Pescara, people have a cute nickname for these pastries—"Lettera d’amore." It's because the dough flaps fold over and seal in the filling, like wrapping up a little love letter.
What’s super cool is how the cross shape on top isn’t just for looks. It’s actually a nod to the pastry’s roots as an Italian Easter dessert . The strips of dough make a cross to symbolize the holiday. And you know what? When you bite into one, you get this soft, golden crust and then that fluffy ricotta inside that tastes like a hug.
There’s even a savory cousin to these, called fiadoni . They can throw some people off if they’re expecting something sweet—but both versions are really really popular in Abruzzo, especially during big celebrations. Folks like to swap stories about whose family recipe is best. Everyone swears by their own twist, whether it’s a dash of lemon zest or something else. These Soffioni Abruzzesi recipes have been passed down for ages, and it’s easy to see why they’re still such a hit. You’ll find them lining bakery shelves every spring, each one a little puffed-up reminder of Abruzzo’s love for sharing good food and special moments. Whether you’re from the region or just visiting, these pastries offer a taste of tradition that’s both unique and comforting. Seriously good.
To prepare the Abruzzo soffioni, remember to place the sheep's ricotta in a fine mesh strainer and let it drain for at least 2 hours to release its whey. Then, proceed with the dough preparation: take a large bowl and add the flour, then add the sugar , the oil , and the eggs plus the yolk .
Knead until you get a smooth and firm dough , which will have a consistency similar to egg pasta, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes , the time needed to prepare the filling.
In the meantime, prepare the cream: grate the zest of a lemon and set it aside in a small bowl . Then separate the egg yolks from the whites, place them into the bowl of a stand mixer , add the sugar , and whisk until you obtain a light and frothy mixture. If you don't have a stand mixer, you can use an electric hand mixer or a whisk.
At this point, sieve the ricotta you had set to drain, using the back of a spoon , and add it to the frothy mixture . Finally, add the grated lemon zest you set aside , mix, and transfer everything to a bowl. Remember not to mix for too long, otherwise, you will whip the ricotta.
Separately, gently whip the egg whites with half a teaspoon of sugar to make them fluffier . Add them to the cream and mix everything .
Now roll out the dough until it reaches a thickness of about 1/8 inch . Divide the sheet into 12 squares, measuring 4x4 inches , and butter a muffin tin using a brush . If you don't have a muffin tin, you can use disposable aluminum molds found in all supermarkets.
After buttering the tin, lightly dust it with flour , and start placing the dough squares into the spaces, ensuring to leave the edges out . Then, pour about 1/4 cup of cream into each dough square .
After pouring the cream, fold the edges inward, without sealing them . After filling all 12 molds , bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 30 minutes. Once the first 30 minutes have passed, lower the temperature to 320°F and bake for another 35 minutes. (If using a convection oven, bake at 320°F for 20 minutes and then lower the temperature to 285°F and bake for another 25 minutes). When the soffioni are golden brown, they are ready. Let them cool slightly and gently remove them from the molds . Dust your Abruzzo soffioni with powdered sugar and serve!
You can store the Abruzzo soffioni in the fridge in an airtight container or well-covered with plastic wrap for up to 2-3 days. You can store the dough in the fridge for 3-4 days or freeze it. It is not recommended to store or freeze the cream.
The origin of the fiadone, ancestor if not twin of the Abruzzo soffione, dates back to the times of Cristoforo di Messisburgo, superintendent of the kitchens at the court of Ferrara. The “Renaissance Steward,” in fact, contains references to this dish, which reached Abruzzo because among the ingredients it included and still includes in some variants saffron, a premium spice of the Aquilan territory. During Easter, it is also decorated with blessed olive leaves, symbolizing peace, and is exchanged as a gift among families.
Soft yet bold in flavor, Abruzzo soffioni are a triumph of balance. It is worth noting that this balance will not be compromised if, instead of goat's ricotta, you use buffalo or cow's ricotta; nor if you choose to add some chocolate chips to the filling.
