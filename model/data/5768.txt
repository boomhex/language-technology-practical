instructions:
Barley minestrone is a traditional and time-honored dish originating from Trentino-Alto Adige region. It's crafted using pearled barley, finely diced vegetables, and smoked bacon, resulting in a truly unique and delightful flavor profile. This dish is notably heartier compared to the classic minestrone , thanks to the addition of chopped meat, making it a substantial and satisfying one-pot meal.

To prepare barley minestrone, start by peeling the vegetables (onion, carrot, celery, potato) and cutting them into small squares . Place the butter in a saucepan and when it's melted, add the onion and let it soften ; then add the carrot and celery to the pot and sauté for 5 minutes .
Add the diced smoked bacon and the barley, which you will have rinsed under running water and drained . Pour in 3 or 4 ladles of beef broth to the barley .
Then, add the bay leaves and let the minestrone simmer over low heat until the barley is fully cooked. Be sure to add hot broth as needed. About 10 minutes before the cooking is complete, add diced potatoes.
Once it's cooked, turn off the heat, season with pepper, add the chopped chives , extra virgin olive oil , and adjust the salt to taste.
Serve immediately, and don't forget to bring some grated Grana Padano cheese to the table!
Store the barley minestrone in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a maximum of 2-3 days.
You can substitute pancetta with a ham bone or a piece of ham hock.
You can replace chives with chopped parsley.
