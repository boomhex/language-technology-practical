To clean and use fasolari, you will need a knife with a rounded tip and a thin blade and a kitchen meat tenderizing mallet. There are two types of fasolari: one with a lighter shell and one with a darker shell: however, the taste and texture of the meat are the same . To correctly clean fasolari, it is necessary to open them by cutting the two internal lateral muscles. Hold them, taking care to place the shorter part of the shell facing downwards in the palm of your hand . Insert the blade between the two shells, helping yourself with finger pressure. Insert the flat tip of the knife all the way in and
slide it sideways, taking care to keep the blade inclined upwards . Slightly force the shell to open it, turn the blade, and cut the other lateral muscle (5-6).
Now proceed to remove the grayish skin covering the fruit and the intestine sac, which contains small stones that, if left inside, will give the sensation of sand in the product (7-8). Detach the fasolaro also from the bottom part of the shell . If you want to consume it raw, the fasolaro is ready, and, taking care to retain its liquid inside the shell, you can season it with a bit of pepper or lemon juice.
If you want to use it cooked, instead, after collecting the mollusk's liquid in a small bowl , extract the fruit from the shell and place it on a cutting board. With the help of a meat tenderizing mallet like this, soften the fasolaro's meat, focusing on the red foot, until it becomes thin, intact, and tender (11-12).
There are several ways to store fasolari: you can put them whole in a bowl and cover them with a damp cloth and keep them in the fridge for no more than 4 days if you will consume them cooked, while 2 days if you intend to consume them raw. You can freeze the whole mollusk with the shell directly, which, once thawed, will need to be cleaned: in this case, everything is preserved for about 2 months . Or you can put the cleaned pulp in a freezer-safe container and keep it ready to cook . That's how to clean fasolari!
