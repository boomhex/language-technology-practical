instructions:
To prepare the ricotta pancakes, melt the butter over very low heat (in the same non-stick pan where you will later cook the pancakes) , let it cool while you prepare the batter. In a bowl, break the whole eggs, add the sugar and beat for a couple of minutes with a hand whisk ,
until the mixture becomes slightly frothy; you don't need to whip it. Add the ricotta and mix gently to combine it. Then pour in the milk and stir briefly again .
Sift the flour and baking powder separately, add a pinch of salt . Then gradually add the dry ingredients to the egg mixture , stirring just enough to incorporate them .
Gently fold in the now-cooled butter , working the batter as little as possible: you will get a fairly thick consistency , similar to cake batter. Don't worry if there are lumps, it's normal. Wipe the pan with a piece of kitchen paper to remove excess melted butter .
Heat the pan over medium heat and when it's hot, place a couple of tablespoons of batter in the center, spreading it slightly with the back of the spoon . Let cook for 3-4 minutes on one side, checking the browning of the base before flipping the pancake : cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side. Place the ready pancake on the serving plate and continue this way until all the batter is used. You will get 7-8 pancakes with these quantities. As they are ready, lay them out without stacking them : avoiding pressing them will keep them fluffy. Only when serving, stack them gently as tradition dictates. Serve with yogurt, cream or a berry sauce, with fresh fruit or the classic and delicious maple syrup!
You can store your ricotta pancakes for 1 day in an airtight container.
We do not recommend freezing.

Want to add blueberries or other ingredients? You can do this directly on the fritters once the base is golden, before flipping them to continue cooking!
