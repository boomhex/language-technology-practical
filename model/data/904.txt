Wrap the obtained dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for about 1 hour in a cool, dry place. Meanwhile, make a sauté of celery, onion, and carrot by browning these finely chopped vegetables with a little extra virgin olive oil (for more details on how to prepare the sauté How to make the soffritto ; if necessary, add a little water during cooking to prevent burning . When all the vegetables are well browned, add the minced meat and cook over high heat for 5 minutes ,
then deglaze with white wine . Add a chopped rosemary and broth to the meat, little by little, then adjust with salt and pepper and continue cooking over medium heat for about 40 minutes.
When the meat is ready, let it cool, then place it in a blender with the ricotta and Parmigiano Reggiano . Blend everything and place the mixture in a piping bag fitted with a plain small tip.
Now proceed with the preparation of fresh pasta. Take a bowl and pour in the sifted flour . Create a well shape with the flour and, after making a small indentation in the center, pour in the eggs and adjust with a pinch of salt. Start mixing the ingredients, incorporating the flour into the eggs little by little and widening the circle . When you have combined all the ingredients, take the dough and place it on a work surface. Knead it with your hands for at least 10 minutes until you obtain a soft and homogeneous dough.
Form a ball that you will cover with plastic wrap . Now take the egg pasta and roll it out with a rolling pin, then cut two sheets as thin as possible using a pasta machine . Brush the two sheets with beaten egg (this will help the filling adhere better) ,
then take the piping bag and pipe strips of filling about 12 inches long, spacing them about 0.4 inches apart . Also, leave a border at the top and bottom of about 0.2 inches, which will be used to close the tagliatelle. Take the second sheet of egg pasta and lay it over the first one . It is important that the tagliatelle are sealed without leaving air inside, so you will need to press with your hand around the filling to seal them and make all the air escape .
Now cut the tagliatelle using a serrated pasta cutter , then place them on a slightly floured tray . Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the tagliatelle for 4-5 minutes, then drain them and set them aside .
In a non-stick pan, melt the butter and add the stuffed tagliatelle: sauté them for a couple of minutes and season them by adding a mixture of aromatic herbs (thyme, oregano, chives, and sage) and plenty of Parmigiano Reggiano . Mix carefully to avoid breaking the stuffed pasta while combining all the ingredients, then serve the stuffed tagliatelle while still hot .
You can store the stuffed tagliatelle, closed in an airtight container and placed in the refrigerator, for up to a couple of days. You can freeze the stuffed tagliatelle: place them uncooked in the freezer, and when you need to use them, drop them in boiling water without thawing first, otherwise, the egg pasta will become too soft.
