instructions:
To prepare the flatbreads with prosciutto, brie, lettuce, and cocktail sauce, start by taking the brie and slicing it horizontally to obtain strips . Then wash the lettuce , making sure there is no soil residue, and dry it .
Meanwhile, heat the flatbread in a shallow pan (or crepe maker) . Cook the 4 flatbreads on both sides for about 2 minutes. If bubbles form in your flatbread during cooking, you can cut them across with a small knife without puncturing the entire dough. Cook the flatbread on both sides . Lay the sliced brie on the flatbread, distributing it evenly so that with the heat, the cheese slightly melts .
Then add the prosciutto and the lettuce . Sprinkle the flatbread with cocktail sauce .
Fold your flatbread in half and cut it into two parts . Your flatbread with prosciutto, brie, lettuce, and cocktail sauce is now ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to eat the flatbread hot right away. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
If you're not a fan of prosciutto, you can replace it with speck. Does lettuce seem too plain? Use round radicchio instead. And for those who prefer milder and less intense flavors, you can use fontina instead of brie. And why not? Mayonnaise instead of cocktail sauce!
