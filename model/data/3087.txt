To make the crepes with Nesquik cream, start by preparing the cream that will be used for the filling: beat the egg yolks in a bowl and add Nesquik , mix to blend the ingredients and obtain a homogeneous mixture , then add the sifted flour and
stir until completely incorporated . Warm the milk in a saucepan or microwave, and then add it to the mixture a little at a time while continuing to stir with the whisk until fully absorbed. Take a saucepan, pour the freshly obtained cream filtering it through a fine sieve to avoid the formation of lumps ,
you will get a smooth and thick cream , meanwhile melt the butter and dark chocolate in the microwave or in a bain-marie , then pour the melted dark chocolate into the Nesquik cream
and also add the melted butter , stir with a whisk and cook the cream over low heat until it becomes thick . Turn off the heat and set the cream aside. Now, proceed with the preparation of the crepes: place the sifted flour and the seeds from the vanilla pod in a bowl
add the sugar and start mixing with a whisk while pouring the milk in a thin stream . In a separate small bowl, beat the whole egg plus the yolk with a fork and add a pinch of salt
and add them to the milk and flour mixture , continue to mix with the whisk until you get a light mixture. Melt the butter in the microwave and incorporate it into the mixture .
Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. Heat a crepe pan or if you don't have one, a non-stick pan, and pour a ladle of batter in the center of the pan ; rotate the pan to spread it well and let it cook for about a minute over moderate heat. When it's cooked, flip the crepe and cook it for another minute. To keep the crepes warm while cooking, stack them on top of each other.
Now cut all the fruit for the filling into small, regular cubes (about 0.4 inches) and set it aside: then cut the strawberries , the kiwis , and the pear .
Take a crepe, place it on a plate and spread a couple of tablespoons of cream over it completely , then add a tablespoon of diced fruit that you will spread over the entire surface .
Once filled, fold the crepe in half and then again in half on itself to form a sort of fan . Continue filling the remaining crepes with Nesquik cream. To finish, garnish your delicious crepes with Nesquik Squeeze and have fun creating designs and decorations with the syrup!
It is recommended to consume the crepes with Nesquik cream immediately. It is possible to store the crepe batter in the refrigerator with plastic wrap for a maximum of 12 hours. If you have leftover cooked crepes, not filled, stack them on top of each other and store them covered in the fridge for a couple of days. Then fill the crepes before serving them.
To fill the crepes with Nesquik cream, you can use other fresh fruits like bananas or berries that pair well with the cream.
