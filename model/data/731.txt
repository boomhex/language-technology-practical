Rice medallions with bagna cauda —seriously tasty—are like a fresh spin on your classic risotto, taking a page from Northern Italy’s Piedmont. Instead of the usual risotto, you’ve got these crispy little rounds. Really good stuff. They're fantastic as a rice appetizer or even a fun side dish.
And listen, the secret? Mixing a genuine anchovy garlic sauce —bagna cauda—right into the rice while it cooks. It’s not just any Italian dipping sauce ; this savory blend of garlic, anchovy and olive oil really really wakes up your taste buds. Traditionally in Piedmont, bagna cauda is a dip, but here it’s the flavor star of the rice.
Thing is, as the rice soaks up the rich, moist broth, it turns creamy and so so delicious. It's reminiscent of the best risotto you’ve ever had, but with a twist. And instead of just serving it up, you press the rice into little disks, browning them until the edges are golden and crispy. For sure, these rice medallions will steal the spotlight at any gathering or dinner party.
In Piedmont, you'll find variations at local events, always paired with a good red wine to match the bold, tangy notes of the sauce. And you know what? Some might say they’re like rice cakes or patties, but the taste is way way more intense thanks to the bagna cauda .
Pretty much, you get a tender inside with a slight crunch outside, bursting with flavors of Italian home cooking. Even if you're new to Piedmontese cuisine , this dish helps you see how a simple sauce can totally transform a meal. For anyone curious about a new savory rice recipe that’s a bit different, serving these medallions is a fun way to show off your Italian food love—and maybe get others to try some regional twists in their own kitchen. It's a dish that brings people together—like the beautiful Piedmont traditions it is inspired by.
