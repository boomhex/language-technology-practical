instructions:
To prepare the ricotta cutlets, first make sure the ricotta is well-drained; otherwise, let it drain in a colander to remove the excess liquid. Place the ricotta in a bowl, then add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano and the salt . Mix well to combine everything .
Once you have a homogeneous mixture , take a portion of about 5.3 oz and flatten it in the palm of your hand to form large, flattened patties . With these quantities, you will get 4 ricotta cutlets.
Now place the corn flakes in a bowl and crumble them with your hands . In another bowl, beat the eggs . Dip the ricotta patties first in the beaten eggs .
Then coat them on both sides with the cereal and place them on a tray as you go . Proceed the same way to bread all the cutlets, then move on to cooking: grease a non-stick pan with oil and heat it well, then place the cutlets .
Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes on one side, then flip them and continue cooking for another 5 minutes . Transfer to absorbent paper and serve your ricotta cutlets as soon as they're ready !
It is recommended to consume the ricotta cutlets immediately.
You can use cow's milk ricotta or sheep's milk ricotta, but make sure it is well-drained; if necessary, let it drain in a colander before using it.
If you prefer, you can bake the cutlets instead of frying them, setting the temperature to 450°F for about 15 minutes.
