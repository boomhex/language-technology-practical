instructions:
To prepare the wholemeal biscuits without butter, place all the dry ingredients in a bowl: the wholemeal spelt flour , brown sugar , and baking ammonia .
Grate the zest of an orange , add the beaten eggs while mixing with a fork . Also, pour in the rice oil in a thin stream .
You can start kneading by hand . When the powders have absorbed the liquids, transfer everything onto the work surface . Without adding flour or fats, knead until you obtain a compact dough. Form a ball and place it in the fridge covered with plastic wrap , for at least 30 minutes.
After the dough has rested, roll it out using a little spelt flour to a thickness of 1/5 inch . Cut with the chosen shape: we used a pudding mold with a diameter of 2 1/5 inches . Re-roll the leftover dough to form more biscuits; with these amounts, you'll get 30 pieces.
Place the biscuits, well spaced, on a baking tray lined with parchment paper . Bake in a preheated static oven at 347°F for 20 minutes. Once baking time is up, move the wholemeal biscuits without butter onto a wire rack and let them cool .
The wholemeal biscuits without butter can be stored for about ten days in a tin box.
Rice oil can be replaced with sunflower seed oil. Baking ammonia makes these shortbread cookies more crumbly, but you can substitute it with double the amount of baking powder. Wholemeal spelt flour is available in supermarkets, but if you prefer, you can use whole wheat flour, keeping the same quantities.
