So, why not give it a shot? Pretty simple and so so worth it.
To make garlic naans, pour the flour into the stand mixer fitted with a hook, then add the minced garlic , the fresh yeast , and the water, which you should pour gradually while working the dough.
When the water has been completely absorbed, add the salt and the yogurt, one tablespoon at a time , until you obtain a soft and homogeneous dough .
Oil a container and transfer the dough with oiled hands into it, then cover with the lid or plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature until it doubles in size: it will take about 8-10 hours, depending on the temperature. After the rising time, transfer the dough to a floured work surface and divide it into 6 pieces of about 3.5 oz each , forming each into a ball .
Lightly flour the dough balls, cover them with a cloth , and let them rise for another 2 hours or so: again, the time depends on the temperature. When the balls are risen, roll them out on a floured surface to a thickness of 1/16 to 1/8 inch . At this point, heat a non-stick griddle, grease it with a little oil , and remove the excess with a paper towel.
Place the naan on the griddle and cook for about 2 minutes: when you start to see bubbles , flip it to the other side and cook for another 2 minutes . In the end, the naan should be bubbly and slightly golden.
Stack the naans as they are cooked and in the meantime prepare the seasoning: mince the garlic clove and the cilantro , place them in a bowl, and add the oil .
Mix well and drizzle your delicious garlic naans with the seasoning (20-21)!
Garlic naans can be stored for one day at room temperature, covered with plastic wrap and without seasoning. They can be frozen after cooking.
If you wish, you can serve the garlic naans with the seasoning on the side so that diners can add it as they like!
