instructions:
To make the baked polenta, first fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil, then salt it and add the oil. Pour the cornmeal in a steady stream and stir continuously with a whisk to avoid lumps. When the water returns to a boil, lower the heat and cook for about 50 minutes, stirring constantly if possible.
Meanwhile, cut the asiago , fontina , and gorgonzola into cubes, then grate the Grana Padano PDO.
Butter a baking dish about 9x7 inches , cover the base with a portion of the polenta , and distribute the cubes of Asiago .
Create another layer of polenta and add the cubes of fontina , then cover with a third layer of polenta and fill with the gorgonzola . Finish with a final layer of polenta and the grated Grana Padano PDO .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 20 minutes . When it's nicely golden on the surface, remove from the oven and serve the baked polenta while still hot and gooey !
The baked polenta can be stored in the fridge for 3-4 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer, you can fill the baked polenta with only one type of cheese or replace those listed with mozzarella, smoked scamorza, or brie!
