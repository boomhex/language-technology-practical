instructions:
To prepare the hosomaki, first prepare the sushi rice . Once ready, let it cool down slightly and prepare the salmon needed for your hosomaki. You should have a frozen fillet, without bones and skin, and well trimmed. Cut the salmon fillet against the grain to obtain strips the length of the seaweed sheet (about 7 inches) and 0.4 inches thick . If the fillet is shorter, don't worry, cut another piece to reach the desired length .
Wrap the makisu in plastic wrap and lay it on a flat surface, place the nori seaweed sheet on top with the shiny side touching the mat. The seaweed should be positioned towards you, almost at the edge of the makisu . Wet your hands with acidulated water and take about 2 oz of cooked rice .
Place it on the rougher surface of the seaweed and spread it out with your fingers . You should leave 0.4 inches of free space from the top edge, and the rice layer should not be too thick. With your index finger, take a pinch of wasabi and spread it in the center of the rice to create a strip .
Then take a strip of salmon and place it in the center of the rice ; if it's not enough, add another piece . Lift the edge of the mat closest to you, holding the salmon strip in place with your two ring fingers
rotate the mat , placing your thumbs underneath, and press the central ingredient inward with your other fingers . Then move the roll forward a bit so that the exposed seaweed strip seals everything. The moisture from the rice will act as a glue; if it's not enough, you can moisten the exposed part of the seaweed. Shape the roll inside the mat by pressing evenly with your hands, moving lengthwise. Unroll the mat
and place the hosomaki on a cutting board. Moisten a sharp knife with non-acidulated water , so the blade won't get damaged. Cut the roll in half , place the two pieces side by side
and cut each into 3 equal parts , to obtain 6 pieces . Do not apply too much pressure during this step. Arrange them on a serving plate and place some pickled ginger on the side . Serve the hosomaki with soy sauce.
We recommend consuming the hosomaki immediately after preparation.
Instead of salmon, you can use tuna or cucumber.
Instead of nori seaweed, hosomaki can be wrapped in a thin omelet, rice or soy paper, and shiso leaf.
For an even more varied sushi dinner, try making Futomaki and Gunkanmaki


Before consuming raw, marinated, or not fully cooked fish, it is recommended to freeze it for at least 96 hours at 0°F in a home freezer marked by 3 or more stars, according to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
