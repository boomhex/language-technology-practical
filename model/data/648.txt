instructions:
To prepare the pasta with cream and asparagus, first take care of cleaning the asparagus: remove the tough ends and peel the stalk with a vegetable peeler , then cut it into slices about 0.4 inches and halve the tips . You will need about 10.5 oz of cleaned asparagus in total.
Clean and chop the shallot . Place a pot of water on the stove to boil and salt for cooking the pasta, and heat a drizzle of oil in another pan. Add the shallot to the pan and let it soften for a minute, then add the asparagus slices .
Also add the tips , salt , pepper, and flavor with thyme leaves .
Cook over high heat for about 5 minutes. When the asparagus is cooked but still crunchy, remove the tips from the pan and set them aside . At this point, pour the cream into the pan and add a hint of grated lemon zest. Drop the tagliatelle into the water, which should now be boiling .
Continue cooking the sauce over low heat for the time it takes the pasta to cook , then drain the tagliatelle al dente into the pan and sauté over high heat for a minute . Plate the pasta with cream and asparagus, garnishing with the reserved tips and fresh thyme to taste!
It is recommended to consume the pasta with cream and asparagus immediately.
For a stronger flavor, you can finish the dish with a grating of Parmesan or Pecorino.
Do not discard the tougher parts of the stalks: you can use them to flavor a vegetable broth!
