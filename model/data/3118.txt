Whether you're enjoying it with a savory dish or as a dessert, Lahuh bread brings Middle Eastern vibes to your table in a casual yet authentically Yemeni way.
With just a few basic Lahuh ingredients and a pan, you create something central to Yemeni cuisine—perfect for sharing. It's a real staple. I mean, it offers an experience rich in taste and tradition, so it's a must-try for anyone looking to dive into the diverse flavors of the Middle East. Super, super good!
To prepare the lahuh, first, soak the white bread, crust removed, in cold water for 5 minutes . Once it's very soft, squeeze it well with your hands . Dissolve the yeast in warm water (alternatively, you can use 12 g of fresh yeast) .
In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, and salt and gradually pour the water with the yeast over them , stirring with a whisk to combine the ingredients well . Add the soaked and well-squeezed bread and
mix to break down the bread and eliminate any lumps . Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the mixture rise at room temperature for about 2 hours; after this time, the mixture will be puffier and full of bubbles .
At this point, you can proceed to cook the lahuh: lightly grease (with vegetable oil or olive oil) a non-stick pan with low edges, about 8 inches in diameter (a crepe pan), spreading the oil with a piece of kitchen paper and pour about 110 g of batter , spreading it over the entire surface of the pan, using the back of a spoon .
Cook the lahuh over medium heat, without ever turning the bread, until even the surface is set (13-14). Once cooked, place the lahuh on a clean cloth, cover it with another cloth. Before continuing with another portion of batter, it's important to cool the pan in a bowl of ice water or under cold running water, to get a smooth bread on one side and full of bubbles on the other. Continue cooking the remaining batter until finished . Serve the lahuh warm!
Store the lahuh in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, for up to 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
If you happen to be in Israel, besides the version proposed here, you might also taste an alternative enriched with chopped fenugreek leaves: very special! There, they mostly use all-purpose flour, but after dozens of tests, we can assure you that it also works perfectly with semolina flour.
