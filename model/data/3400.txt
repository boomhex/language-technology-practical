Ghiaccioli are the Italian answer to those classic fruit popsicles you see everywhere in the summer. They're honestly about as easy as treats get. These sweet little frozen desserts pop up all over Italy, with flavors that totally vary by region—like tangy lemon in the south, super juicy strawberry in the north, or orange that everybody loves. The idea? Really simple: just mix fresh fruit juice with a syrup made from water and sugar, then freeze it. Can't go wrong with that, right? The result is a homemade popsicle that's way way better than anything from the store.
Italian families have been making ghiaccioli for ages, and they're just as popular with grown-ups as they are with kids, especially when it's scorching outside and you need something refreshing. In the summer, ghiaccioli show up at beach stands, parks, and kitchen freezers all over Italy because people can’t get enough of that crisp, icy bite. And look, there’s something so satisfying about how these popsicle recipes turn super basic stuff—like strawberries, lemons, or oranges—into a cool, colorful snack everyone wants.
Kids will grab them after school. Adults grab one to chill out. Nobody ever says no to a fruit popsicle when it’s blazing hot outside. Plus, you can change up the flavors however you like, making them one of those easy popsicle recipes you end up making on repeat. Seriously good. They're also a bit healthier than most store-bought frozen treats, since you know what’s going in them, and you can play around with less sugar or more juice for your own twist.
Honestly, ghiaccioli are the kind of thing that shows simple food can be the best, fitting right in with all those other classic summer desserts people love. Whether you're on a beach in Sicily or chilling in a Milanese park—pretty much anywhere—ghiaccioli bring a slice of Italian summer to any spot. Grab your favorite fruit, whip up a batch, and enjoy a delicious, icy treat that's perfect for any sunny day. Which is great.
To prepare the strawberry popsicles, start by making a syrup: heat the water in a small saucepan and add the sugar , let the sugar dissolve completely, turn off the heat and let it cool .
While the syrup cools, clean and wash the strawberries thoroughly under running water and blend them until they reach a creamy consistency . Add the now-cold syrup to the strawberry puree
and the juice of half a lemon, previously filtered . Mix well, strain the mixture using a fine mesh strainer and, if foam has formed, remove it with a spoon .
Now, take some common popsicle sticks and a sheet of aluminum foil. Form a small cord, wrap it around the stick , and secure the ends to the sides of the popsicle mold . This will help keep the stick centered when you pour the liquid mixture into the mold. At this point, pour the mixture into the mold, leaving 1/2 inch of space from the edge . Put your strawberry popsicles in the freezer until they have solidified!
To prepare the lemon popsicles, start by preparing the syrup using the same procedure described above. While the syrup cools, squeeze the lemons until you obtain 5 oz of juice, filter it with a fine mesh strainer and add it to the now-cold syrup . Repeat the stick procedure for the lemon popsicles, pour the liquid into the molds remembering to leave 1/2 inch of space from the edge. Put them in the freezer until they have reached a solid consistency.
To prepare the orange popsicles, start by preparing the syrup using the same procedure described above. While the syrup cools, squeeze the oranges and filter the juice with a fine mesh strainer and add it to the now-cold syrup . Repeat the stick procedure for the orange popsicles, pour the liquid into the molds remembering to leave 1/2 inch of space from the edge. Put them in the freezer until they have reached a solid consistency.
With the quantity indicated in the recipe, you will get 12 popsicles, 4 for each flavor. The molds have a capacity of 2 oz. If you want sweeter popsicles, you can add more sugar to the recipe as indicated. Be careful to place the stick precisely in the center, otherwise it won't support the weight of the popsicle. If you can't find popsicle molds, you can use regular plastic coffee cups, following the same procedure!
You can store the popsicles in the freezer for a couple of weeks
