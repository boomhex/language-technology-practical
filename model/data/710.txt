instructions:
To prepare the eggless crepes, first melt the butter in a saucepan and set aside. In a bowl, pour the flour , cinnamon , and a pinch of salt, then mix quickly. Add the milk while continuing to stir to avoid lumps.
Also, add the melted, cooled butter and mix again to blend everything . Cover with plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the filling: put the yogurt in a bowl, add the powdered sugar , and mix until you get a creamy and smooth mixture . Grease a 9.5-inch diameter crepe pan (or a non-stick pan of the same size) with a little butter.
Pour a ladle of batter into the center , and by rotating the pan, spread it over the entire surface. Cook over medium heat for about a minute. When the crepe starts to come away from the edges, you can flip it and cook the other side for a minute until golden. Continue like this until all the batter is used up. As you cook the crepes, stack them on a serving plate .
Fold the crepes in half twice to form triangles and garnish with the yogurt cream . Finally, finish with raspberries, blackberries , and a few mint leaves. Your eggless crepes are ready to be served !
The eggless crepes can be stored in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in a closed container, for 1-2 days.
With this recipe, you will get a neutral batter: for a sweeter version, you can add 30 g of sugar or 2 tablespoons of honey.
You can replace the cinnamon with the same amount of turmeric to mimic the color of crepes with eggs.
