instructions:
The cabbage and carrot salad (coleslaw) is a side dish of Irish origin, very widespread in all English-speaking countries. Coleslaw is usually made with green cabbage (sometimes with red cabbage too), carrots, and spring onion (or shallot) and then dressed with a tasty sauce made of low-fat yogurt, mustard, mayonnaise, and chives. The cabbage and carrot salad is a flavorful vegetarian side dish that is easy to prepare, ideal to accompany your meat or fish main courses, and is a must-have paired with pulled pork inside the homonymous sandwich, also in the chicken version (pulled chicken)!

To prepare the cabbage and carrot salad, start by peeling the carrots and cutting them into julienne strips (or you can simply purchase pre-cut stick carrots). Remove the outermost leaves of the cabbage and slice the rest thinly to get a julienne . Mix the cabbage and carrots in a salad bowl and also add the very finely sliced spring onion .
Then prepare the dressing: in a bowl, blend the low-fat yogurt with the mayonnaise , then add the mustard , the vinegar , and the sugar,
the salt, and the pepper . Lastly, incorporate the chives (saving some for garnishing the dish). Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Dress the julienned vegetables with the obtained dressing . Serve the cabbage and carrot salad immediately or keep it refrigerated!
