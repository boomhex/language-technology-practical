instructions:
To prepare the lemon cream, peel the lemons, being careful not to take the white part (you can leave half a lemon aside to grate some zest at the end of cooking the cream) and add the zest to a saucepan where you have added the milk. Turn on the low heat and let the milk warm (it should not reach boiling). Meanwhile, in a bowl, place the egg yolks and sugar and whisk them together .
You will need to obtain a smooth cream before adding the sifted flour and cornstarch ; mix with the whisk to combine the powders , then add the warmed milk .
Mix vigorously to obtain a smooth and fluid mixture , then pour it back into the saucepan, straining it with a fine-mesh sieve to avoid lumps . Turn on the low heat and cook the cream, stirring continuously with the whisks until it thickens (this will take about 15 minutes).
When it has thickened, before turning off the heat, you can grate some lemon zest if you prefer to enhance the flavor ; then turn off the heat and transfer the cream to a bowl , cover it with cling film in contact , and let it cool before placing it in the refrigerator to use it!
Lemon cream can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days covered with plastic wrap. It can be frozen and thawed in the refrigerator when needed.
If you love citrus fruits, you can similarly cook an orange custard by replacing the lemon zest with orange zest!
