To prepare the bread dough strudel with vegetables and robiola, start by preparing the bread dough: put the beer in a bowl and dissolve the honey and the brewer's yeast in it (alternatively to fresh brewer's yeast you can use 6 g of dried brewer's yeast). Then add the resulting liquid to the flour and knead, adding more beer if needed ,
until you have obtained a soft and elastic consistency like classic bread dough . Let the dough rise for about two hours (it should double in volume). Meanwhile, wash the vegetables well and cut them into cubes, then place them in a non-stick pan with two tablespoons of oil , let them cook and soften, season with salt and pepper. Place the vegetables in a bowl and let them cool slightly, then add the robiola ,
thyme , parmesan, salt, and pepper . Roll out the bread dough on a pastry board, brush it with the beaten egg
and spread the vegetable and robiola mixture over it , making sure to leave the edges of the dough empty. Roll the dough (as for a strudel) and press well on the edges to seal it . Place the strudel on a baking sheet and brush it with oil , then let it rise for about 30 minutes. Bake the strudel in the oven at 390°F for 20/25 minutes. Let it cool slightly and serve it by cutting it into slices!
Store the bread dough strudel with vegetables in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 2-3 days. The strudel can be frozen once cooked, after it has completely cooled. If needed, it can be thawed in the refrigerator and reheated in the oven.
If you have leftover bread dough scraps, you can make decorations for the strudel like the one you see in photo 12: make long strips of dough and arrange them by crossing them over the surface of the strudel, securing them with beaten egg.
