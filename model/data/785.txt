instructions:
To prepare pasta with ricotta and asparagus, first peel and finely slice the shallot. Now clean the asparagus by removing the end of the stalk, which is the lightest and most fibrous part . Proceed by slicing the stalks into fairly thick rounds. Please only slice the stalks, leaving the tips whole .
Pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, heat it, and add the asparagus tips to evenly brown them. Add a pinch of salt for seasoning and let them cook for about 2 minutes. In another pan, heat another round of oil, and as soon as it's hot, add the shallot and sauté it gently, being careful not to burn it .
After a few moments, add the asparagus stalks , let them cook over moderate heat, adding a good pinch of salt . Cook for about 10 minutes, and if needed, add a ladle of hot water .
When they become tender, transfer them to the container of an immersion blender. Add the grated Parmesan , ricotta , and about a ladle of hot water . Blend everything until a smooth cream is obtained.
Cook the pasta in abundant boiling water, salted to taste . Transfer the ricotta and asparagus cream to a large bowl . If it seems too thick, you can add a drop of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta al dente and add it to the bowl .
Mix well to perfectly dress everything . All you have to do is plate it. Transfer the pasta to the dishes, add the asparagus tips , a pinch of black pepper, and serve .
We recommend consuming pasta with ricotta and asparagus immediately. Alternatively, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day.
