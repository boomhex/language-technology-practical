To prepare the wholemeal muffins with vegetables and tuna, start with the vegetables that need to cool before being added to the batter: trim the carrots and peel them with a vegetable peeler , then cut them into cubes . Then remove the outer layers of the leek and slice it thinly ;
finally, chop the chives . In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil and first sauté the leek , then add the diced carrots ; cook for about 5 minutes
finally, add the chopped chives . Season with salt and pepper, then cover with a lid and let cook for another 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once ready, turn off the heat and let cool;
in the meantime, drain the tuna in a strainer until you get 100 g of drained tuna and set aside 40 g of its oil for use in the muffin batter. Then move on to the muffin batter: in a bowl, pour the wholemeal flour and the baking powder for savory preparations , while in another bowl beat the egg, season with salt and pepper, then add the milk
and the reserved tuna oil (40 g) . Mix everything with a whisk and slowly add the liquid to the flour , stirring with a whisk until the mixture is well combined .
Add the grated Parmesan cheese , take the drained tuna , and add it to the batter ;
finally, add the now cooled vegetables . Mix everything and transfer the batter into a piping bag . Butter and flour the mini muffin molds: we used those with a surface diameter of approximately 2.36 inches and a capacity of 1/4 cup in disposable aluminum.
Place them on a baking sheet and start filling them , leaving a margin of about 1/4 inch from the edge because they will rise during baking. Once ready , bake the muffins in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 20-25 minutes (if using a fan oven, at 320°F for about 10-15 minutes). Once baked , remove from the oven and let the wholemeal muffins with vegetables and tuna cool on a rack.
You can store the wholemeal muffins with vegetables and tuna under a glass dome for 1-2 days.
They can be frozen if you used all fresh, not previously frozen ingredients.
If you prefer, you can add other vegetables to the muffins, such as potatoes, peas, zucchini, onions, or bell peppers! Instead of wholemeal flour, you can also use all-purpose flour or Kamut® flour!
