For anyone wanting a little food adventure, Tirtlan is a guaranteed way to add bold new flavor and family-friendly variety to your favorite stuffed pasta or authentic pasta lineup.
In a bowl, pour the two flours ; add the eggs, the tablespoon of oil , the salt, and lukewarm water and work the ingredients until you obtain a smooth dough.
When the dough is smooth and homogeneous , cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest for half an hour in a cool place. Wash and boil the whole potatoes with their skins in salted water for about 25 minutes (however, this will depend on the size of the potatoes: check for doneness with a skewer). At this point, start preparing the filling: pour a drizzle of oil in a non-stick pan and add the finely chopped shallot, which you will sweat over low heat until it becomes translucent (it should not take on a golden color) .
Chop the chives , peel and mash the boiled potatoes using a potato masher and put the obtained puree in a bowl with the ricotta ; add the shallot, adjust the salt, and add the chives.
Mix the ingredients until you get a homogeneous mixture . Roll out the dough to obtain a sheet at least 1mm thin (11-12), or even thinner if you can.
Using a pastry cutter, cut the sheet into discs about 4 inches in diameter . Place the filling, about 1 oz, in the center of the sheet, using a piping bag if you prefer , and with a brush or your fingers, moisten the edges of the disc with water .
Cover the first disc with another sheet , press the edges to expel excess air, and seal well with a fluted pastry wheel . Fill a pot with oil and heat it. When it reaches a temperature of 356°F, immerse the tirtlan and fry them .
Now turn your tirtlan over on both sides . When they have reached a golden color, drain them using a slotted spoon and place them on paper towels . Your tirtlan, excellent when hot, are now ready to be enjoyed !
The fried tirtlan should be consumed immediately. It is not recommended to store them in the fridge. You can freeze them if you have used fresh ingredients before frying.
You can flavor your potato and ricotta tirtlan with aromatic herbs of your choice, such as thyme, marjoram, and/or dill.
If you prefer a more intense flavor, you can use robiola instead of ricotta.
Extra tip if you have guests for dinner: prepare the potato and ricotta tirtlan in advance, sprinkle them with flour, and cover them with a cloth. Fry them just before your guests arrive: they will be crispy and hot, ensuring a great impression!
