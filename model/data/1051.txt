instructions:
To prepare the bell pepper and burrata risotto, clean the bell pepper by removing the cap , the white filaments, and the internal seeds. Cut it first into slices and then into pieces; there is no need to be very precise . Peel and slice the onion as well .
Pour a dash of oil into a saucepan and add the bell peppers, the onion , the peeled tomatoes , and the drained anchovies .
Mix everything together , pour in two ladles of hot vegetable broth , and cook over low heat for about twenty minutes, stirring occasionally .
After twenty minutes, turn off the heat and let it cool slightly. Then, transfer it to a blender glass and blend everything until you get a cream. Add the basil leaves and blend for a few more seconds .
In the same saucepan where you cooked the bell peppers, pour a drizzle of oil, add the rice , and toast it, stirring often. Once the grains are translucent, add the bell pepper cream and cook the rice by adding broth as needed .
When the rice is al dente, and the broth has evaporated well, turn off the heat. Add a drizzle of oil and stir to mix well . Transfer a portion of risotto to a plate ,
add about 1 oz of burrata per portion , decorate with basil leaves , and serve the risotto hot .
The risotto can be stored in the refrigerator for 1 day. We recommend adding the burrata only after reheating it.
For a more intense flavor, add desalted capers and a chop of black olives!
