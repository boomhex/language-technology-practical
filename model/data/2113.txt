To prepare the daikon and shrimp salad, first make sure that your shrimp have been frozen at -0.4°F for at least 96 hours if you're not sure, we recommend freezing them and thawing before using them in the recipe. Shell the shrimp, removing the shell and legs , then detach the tail and finally, with a small knife, remove the black thread found on the back ; for further information, consult our guide How to clean shrimp . Place the cleaned shrimp in a bowl, season with olive oil ,
the salt flakes , lemon zest , and fresh basil leaves, breaking them with your hands .

Add salt , rice vinegar , wasabi paste , and add half of the seed oil.
Start to emulsify everything with the immersion blender, adding the remaining oil as well . Blend until you obtain a creamy and frothy sauce . Now prepare the vegetables: wash, peel the carrots, and using the same peeler, cut thin slices of carrots
Stack them on top of each other, then fold them in two and cut them into julienne strips . To preserve the bright color of the carrots, place them in a sieve submerged in a bowl with ice water . Repeat the same procedure for the daikon (preferring the sweeter top part): peel it
