instructions:
To prepare lasagna al forno, first of all peel the onion and chop it finely . Place it in a large pot with some oil and let it brown for a few minutes at a medium temperature, then also add the ground beef .
Turn up the heat and brown, stirring and breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon . When well browned, deglaze with red wine and let the alcohol content evaporate. Lower the heat again and then add the tomato puree .
Rinse the pitcher using half a liter of water and pour it into the pot . Add a pinch of salt and stir again. Let it cook for 45 minutes ; after this time the sauce should not have thickened too much .
Now, cut the mozzarella into small pieces . Use a large lasagna pan (about 12x8 inches) and spread a layer of sauce on the bottom . Create a first layer of pasta sheets, slightly overlapping them .
Add more sauce , then the grated Grana Padano PDO and the mozzarella cubes .
Arrange the ham slices on top and add some more sauce . Place a layer of pasta on top . Continue until all the ingredients are finished.
Remember that the last layer will consist only of pasta, sauce , grated cheese and mozzarella cheese . Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 350°F ( 180°C) for about 45 minutes. Then bake and let it rest for a few minutes before cutting and serving your rich baked lasagna!
Lasagna al forno can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
To fill up your baked lasagna, you can substitute mozzarella cheese with other stringy cheeses of your liking: from dairy to smoked or matured!
