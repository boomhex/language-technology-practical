To make the strawberry grape sorbet, remove all the grapes from the bunches and place them in the cup of a blender . Squeeze half a lemon and add the juice to the grapes , then blend everything until it turns into a puree.
Strain the strawberry grape mixture to remove all the seeds using a sieve and spatula, collecting it in a bowl, then add the granulated sugar and mix well until completely dissolved . At this point, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the freezer for about half an hour, so that the mixture becomes very cold but not hard (alternatively, you can also cool it in the refrigerator for an hour). Once the necessary time has passed, whisk the egg white until very stiff .
and add it to the strawberry grape mixture, being careful not to deflate it ; mix well with a whisk until homogeneous. Pour everything into the ice cream maker and let it churn for at least 35-40 minutes, or until you get a creamy sorbet . Serve the strawberry grape sorbet well chilled.
The strawberry grape sorbet can be stored in the freezer, closed in an airtight container, for about a week.
If you don't have an ice cream maker, place the mixture in a bowl, covered with plastic wrap, and put it in the freezer, remembering to break it up with the prongs of a fork every half hour, until you achieve the creaminess and right consistency of your sorbet. It will take about 3 hours. If you wish, you can add 2.4 oz of Port (or another liquor) to make it more flavorful.
