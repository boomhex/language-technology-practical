instructions:
To clean the agretti, start by placing them on a cutting board and use a knife to cut off the lower part of the roots and discard it . If you prefer, you can also do this by breaking a few agretti at a time by hand. Pour some water into a large bowl and add a tablespoon of baking soda .
Mix and place the agretti inside . Change the water 1-2 times until the water in the bowl looks clean. Then rinse them under running water and use them for your recipes.
To boil the agretti, fill a pot with water, add the previously cleaned agretti, and place it on the stove . Add salt and let them cook for 5 minutes after boiling .
To maintain the vibrant color of the agretti, scoop them out with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a bowl of ice water ; this will immediately stop the cooking process. Drain them well and drizzle with a little olive oil before serving .
To steam the agretti, pour a cup of water into a pot , place a steamer basket on top , and put the previously cleaned agretti inside. Season with salt .
Cover with the appropriate lid and let them steam for 15 minutes . Transfer the agretti to a plate and dress with oil and a sprinkle of black pepper.
To cook the agretti in a pan, peel a garlic clove and place it in a pan with a little olive oil . Let it brown and add the already cleaned agretti . Stir to flavor them .
Season with salt and pepper , then cook for about 15 minutes , adding a splash of water if needed. Remove the garlic clove and serve the sautéed agretti .
Raw agretti can be stored in the refrigerator, wrapped in paper towels, on the lower shelf. This will keep them fresh for up to 4-5 days. Once cooked, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for about 3 days.
With agretti, you can prepare many recipes. Not just side dishes, but also main courses or rustic pizzas!
