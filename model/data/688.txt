Basmati rice with grilled prawns and bell peppers —seriously good stuff—brings a ton of fresh flavor and color to the table, especially when you're looking for something a bit different from your usual rice salad. And look, this seafood rice dish gets a boost from the sweet crunch of seasonal peppers and the bright pop of lime that goes over the tender prawns as they grill. Unlike the classic rice salad, which can get a little old after a few picnics, this one mixes things up with an international twist. It feels super light and zesty—exactly what you'd want on a hot summer day. Plus, sautéed vegetables add a nice bit of moist texture, and the aroma from the pan—seriously, you'll love it—is enough to make you hungry before you even sit down. People really, really like how the flavors bounce off each other—there's a bit of tangy citrus, the mellow nuttiness from the basmati rice , and a gentle char from the prawns and peppers, all working together.

There are plenty of ways to make it your own, depending on what vegetables you have from the farmer’s market or what’s in season. It’s the kind of easy seafood dinner that can go from a casual family meal to something a little more impressive for friends. The combo of sweet peppers and juicy grilled prawns just pops with that squeeze of lime—so, so good—making each bite super colorful. With the crispy edges on the prawns and the fluffy rice underneath, every forkful feels like a celebration of summer produce and fresh seafood. And, while it’s not your typical Mediterranean rice dish, the flavors work so well together, you'll probably end up making this again and again. Here's the deal: when you want a break from the same old stuff, this dish captures the heart of sunny days—just makes people want to dig in and enjoy. It's a perfect addition to any summer menu, for sure.
