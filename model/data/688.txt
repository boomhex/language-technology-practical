To make the festive stuffed cockerel, first put the bread in a bowl along with the milk and the raisins and let it soak for about 10 minutes .

Squeeze the soaked bread with your hands and transfer it to a bowl , then add the minced pork and the chopped chestnuts .
Add the egg , the grated cheese , and the chopped aromatic herbs .
Finally, season with nutmeg , salt , and pepper. Mix everything until you get a compact and homogeneous mixture .
Fill the cockerel with the stuffing , taking care to distribute it evenly , then bring the edges together to reshape it .
Sew the edges with a needle and kitchen twine, making sure to seal both ends carefully , then tie the legs together as well .
Transfer the stuffed cockerel to a baking dish, add more aromatic herbs, and brush the surface with the mixed oil and melted butter . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 45-50 minutes . Your festive stuffed cockerel is ready to be served !
