Flaó cake, I gotta say, really brings a taste of the Balearic Islands straight to your table. Every bite—seriously good—captures the fresh, Mediterranean vibe of Ibiza. This Ibizan cheesecake is way way different thanks to its mix of spreadable cheese , goat cheese, and a splash of Greek yogurt. And look, it’s all wrapped up in a tender shortcrust pastry. Lemon zest and chopped mint leaves add this pop of zesty flavor that wakes up your taste buds, giving the cake a sweet and herbal twist you just won’t find in most other desserts. The aroma alone? It tells you this isn’t your everyday cheesecake. It’s got a lightness that reminds you of sea breezes and sunny days. Which is great.
Locals often serve this traditional Spanish dessert at Easter, but honestly, it’s become so popular you’ll spot it at all sorts of gatherings now. The hint of mint really shows off Ibiza’s love for fresh herbs and those Mediterranean touches that make food here so different. Over the years, flaó cake has picked up a bit of a following. You know, with food lovers who are into both creamy and tangy desserts. Pretty much.
Some folks lean into the savory side by using a little less sugar and really letting the goat cheese and mint shine. Others make it more sweet to enjoy with coffee or as an afternoon snack. What’s cool is how this Spanish mint cheesecake feels both old-school and new, tying back to medieval roots while fitting right in at a modern table. For real. There are even small differences from town to town in Ibiza—like some bakeries adding a sprinkle of aniseed or a touch more lemony flavor—to make their version stand out.
No matter how you slice it, the flaó cake is an awesome choice for anyone wanting to taste a bit of history and enjoy a moist, flavorful bite that’s all about the island’s spirit. It’s the kind of Ibiza pastry that makes you want to hang out with friends, share stories, and discover what makes this place’s food so unique. Whether you're enjoying it at a festive occasion or a quiet family dinner, flaó cake offers a delicious glimpse into Ibiza’s bright culinary landscape.
To prepare the flaó cake, start with the base: squeeze the orange juice needed for the recipe and set aside. Sift flour and baking powder into a bowl , mix them and form a well in which to pour the egg and oil .
Then add the liqueur , the orange juice , and the sugar .
Finally, flavor with grated lemon zest . Mix with a wooden spoon until you get a homogeneous mixture .
Mold with your hands to obtain a sphere and wrap it in plastic wrap, letting it rest in the refrigerator for about half an hour . In the meantime, focus on the cream: pour the goat cheese, cream cheese, and Greek yogurt into a bowl .
Then season with cinnamon , grated lemon zest . Add the sugar .
and mix everything briefly with a hand whisk . Complete by pouring lightly beaten eggs , fresh liquid cream .
and mint leaves (gently cleaned with a cloth) minced with a knife; pour it immediately after mincing to retain flavor and aroma . Take the base, remove the plastic wrap, and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface . You will need to create a sheet capable of lining a mold (with a removable bottom) 9 inches in diameter. With the help of the rolling pin, unroll the sheet obtained onto the mold .
Remove excess dough and prick the base with the prongs of a fork . Then pour in the cream .
and once ready , proceed with baking in a static oven, preheated, at 350°F for about 1 hour. During baking, it will tend to puff up a lot but don't worry, once ready it will settle. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature before unmolding and refrigerating for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight. The next day you can enjoy it and decorate it with fresh fruit, mint, or giant flowers: enjoy your flaó cake !
The flaó cake can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. If you prefer, you can also freeze it; however, the texture will change a bit. The base dough can also be prepared the day before and stored in the fridge; it can also be frozen. The cream, on the other hand, should not be prepared too far in advance.
If you wish, you can make your flaó cake even more delicious by replacing the cream cheese with more goat cheese: it will become truly more interesting!
