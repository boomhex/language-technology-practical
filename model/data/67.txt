instructions:
To prepare the cotechino in a pressure cooker you need a fresh cotechino, not a pre-cooked one. Prick it and place it in the pressure cooker . At this point, wash and roughly chop the celery, carrots, and parsley . If you prefer, you can also choose not to peel the carrots.
Trim the shallot and cut it into pieces . Now pour about 2 liters (about 8 1/2 cups) of water into the pressure cooker , add the juniper berries .
Add the sage leaves , the shallot , the celery, parsley, and carrots .
Add the salt and close the pot with its lid . Turn on medium heat and, when it starts whistling, lower the flame and let it cook for 35 minutes. After this time, turn off the heat and lift the valve to release the steam; when it's no longer under pressure, you can open the lid .
Remove the cotechino from the water and place it on a cutting board. Remove any string and slice it. Serve your cotechino in a pressure cooker accompanied with lentils or purée !
The cotechino in a pressure cooker can be kept in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Let the cotechino cool for a few minutes before slicing it, this way you'll get more uniform slices. You can cook the cotechino without the vegetables, but it will be less aromatic.
