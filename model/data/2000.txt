So here's the thing, citrus risotto is kinda magical. It’s from northern Italy—where, honestly, they know their stuff. Creamy rice with a zesty twist. Super super tasty. They mix in fresh orange, lemon, and maybe a bit of grapefruit or mandarin. And the zest? Really gives it that bright, zingy flavor that just works with the arborio rice base. This isn’t your usual heavy dish; it’s light, moist, and a little tangy because of all that citrus juice and zest.
In places like Liguria and Sicily—where citrus is everywhere—locals put their own spin on it. And think lemon risotto or a fun orange version. It feels special. But it's pretty simple, making it perfect for a cozy night in or a romantic dinner. And listen, for a twist, some folks add shrimp or swordfish, especially along the coast. It turns an orange risotto into something like a seaside getaway.
You end up with a dish that’s both tender and packed with summer vibes, even when it’s cold out. People in northern Italy pride themselves on fresh local ingredients—everything tastes brighter. The secret to a really really good citrus risotto is balance. You want that zesty pop without overpowering the creamy texture. Add a chilled glass of wine—seriously good—and you’ve got a meal that feels fancy but is actually easy to make at home.
Whether you go classic or try a quick orange version, it’s a dish that feels a bit special. Perfect for sharing with someone you like. Or just treating yourself to something fresh and homemade—no question. This risotto really brings a taste of Italy to your table. With its beautiful mix of flavors, it’s sure to become your go-to whenever you want to impress without the stress.
To prepare the citrus risotto, first start by preparing the broth. Clean the onion and cut it in half . Place it on the heat in a fairly large pot with the cut side down .
Meanwhile, using a peeler, peel both the orange and the lemon , being careful not to take the white part, which would be bitter. Make sure to get rather large pieces of peel .
Move on to the carrot, cut it into pieces without peeling it, but make sure to wash it well . As soon as the onion is well browned add the water to the same pot, along with the carrots
the orange and lemon peels . Then also add the black peppercorns and a tablespoon of coarse salt .
Bring to a boil and let cook for about an hour . Then strain everything and keep the broth warm.
At this point, take the lemon and the orange from which you took the peel and peel them both completely (16-17), being careful to remove all the white part. Then cut the orange first into slices and then into cubes, trying not to lose the juices .
Repeat the same operation for the lemon, to obtain cubes of the same size. Finely chop the onion and let it brown in a pot with the oil, adding a ladle of broth to stew it gently .
Only when the broth has evaporated and the onion is well wilted, add the rice . Toast it over medium-low heat for about 2 minutes, stirring often , then deglaze with the white wine .
As soon as the alcohol has evaporated, pour in a ladle of broth and continue cooking for about 15-18 minutes, adding more as needed and stirring. For cooking times, we recommend following the instructions on the risotto package. When 2-3 minutes are left and the rice is almost cooked, season with salt and pepper .
Add the citrus cubes and stir to combine everything ; don't worry if the citrus cubes don't remain intact but slightly crumble. As soon as it is perfectly cooked, turn off the heat and add the mascarpone .
Stir and also add the pecorino . Stir again, and if necessary, add another ladle of broth. Finally, add the thyme leaves and serve your citrus risotto still hot .
It is recommended to consume the citrus risotto immediately. Alternatively, it can be stored for a maximum of one day in the refrigerator, in an airtight container.
The broth, on the other hand, can be stored for 3 days in the refrigerator and heated as needed.
If you prefer, you can also use grapefruit or tangerines.
To enhance the fragrance of the risotto, add a lemongrass stalk to the broth and garnish the dish with crushed pink pepper.
As an alternative to mascarpone, you can use cream cheese or butter.
