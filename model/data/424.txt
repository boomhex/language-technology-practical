instructions:
To prepare the marbled pound cake with caramel and nuts, start with the batter: in a bowl, use electric beaters to work the softened butter at room temperature, adding the lemon zest and sugar . It will take about 10 minutes for the mixture to become frothy. Gradually add the eggs (slightly beaten), while continuing to work with the beaters , and you should obtain a whipped and homogeneous mixture .
It's time to incorporate the dry ingredients: sift the flour, starch with the baking powder , and combine with the rest using a spatula . When the mixture starts to thicken, you can also pour in the Greek yogurt and incorporate it with the spatula.
Divide the mixture into two bowls , sift the cocoa powder in one and add the liquid fresh cream which will help balance the softness of the cocoa batter.
Mix the cocoa batter well . Carefully butter a loaf pan 10x4x4 inches and pour the two batters into two different piping bags: start with the light batter, properly filling the base .
Continue alternating layers with the cocoa one and proceed in this way until the batters are finished, always alternating them. Now you can marble them, using a spatula to create swirls, to mix the two batters . Close the lid of the pan . Bake the pound cake for 60 minutes, in a preheated static oven at 340°F.
Now place all the nuts in a mixer cup and blend to obtain coarse crumbs. Proceed to make the caramel: pour sugar and water into a saucepan .
Cook without stirring, until boiling or if you need to stir, use a wooden spoon. When it turns a beautiful amber color , proceed to remove it from the heat and pour in the liquid fresh cream at room temperature, a little at a time . In this phase, we recommend being careful as the thermal shock might cause it to boil vigorously.
Once you've finished adding the cream and mixing the ingredients, you can pour in the butter off the heat , stir and add salt then the nuts .
Mix well and transfer everything into a large bowl . Once ready, take the pound cake out of the oven, remove the lid, and let it cool for about 10 minutes .
Then you can unmold and let it cool on a rack , then pour the caramel with nuts over the entire pound cake, making sure to place a tray under the rack, so as to collect the excess that will not remain on the dessert . Wait for it to set. Your marbled pound cake with caramel and nuts is ready to be enjoyed!
The marbled pound cake with caramel and nuts keeps for 2 days under a glass dome.
It can be frozen in portions, possibly without the caramel topping.
If you don't have a loaf pan with a lid, you can use a normal loaf pan and then cover it with aluminum foil or parchment paper during baking: this will help maintain the right moisture in the pound cake!
