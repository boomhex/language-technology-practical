If you're diving into Neapolitan cuisine , you really gotta try the battilocchio napoletano. It's a hidden gem among street foods in Naples, Southern Italy. These crispy, fried pockets have been a favorite for locals on the go for ages. Seriously good stuff. They're perfect for carrying around, and each bite? Packed with flavor. Unlike pizza fritta or panzerotto, battilocchio is smaller and often stuffed with some mouthwatering combos. Traditionally, they’re filled with cicoli, which are crunchy bits of pork crackling mixed with creamy ricotta. But here's the thing—this modern twist has a really really good mix of ricotta, smoked provola cheese, sweet peeled cherry tomatoes, and a spoonful of basil pesto. And the result? A moist and tender center, oozing with cheese and that distinctive pesto zing. It's a blend of tradition and innovation, highlighting how Neapolitan recipes evolve while staying true to their roots.
Naples is all about its street food, and battilocchio is a perfect example of why. You’ll find these little fried calzone-style snacks at food stalls, especially when locals crave a quick bite with loads of character. The dough is fried to a golden perfection—super tasty—giving a satisfying crunch with every bite. It is one of those traditional Neapolitan dishes you cannot get enough of. Pretty much. Each piece offers a taste of history and modern flair, thanks to the creativity of pizzaiolo Davide Civitiello. Even the Neapolitan dialect plays a part in food names and traditions, turning every battilocchio into a mini history lesson about Naples' vibrant street food scene. Whether you're keen to learn some Neapolitan expressions or just want something tangy and cheesy, this dish captures the core of Neapolitan culture in a snack that's fun, filling, and really worth the hype. So next time you are in Naples, make sure to grab a battilocchio and enjoy a true taste of the city's culinary heritage.

To prepare the Neapolitan battilocchio, pour the flour and yeast into a large bowl , then mix with your hand. Add part of the water and mix again to absorb it completely . Gradually pour in the remaining water while continuing to knead by hand until you obtain a homogeneous mixture.
At this point, add the salt and knead to incorporate it evenly, first in the bowl and then on the work surface, giving it slap&fold folds ; the process will take about 15 minutes in total.
When the dough is smooth, uniform, and compact, form a ball, cover it with the bowl and let it rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. After this time, give it a few more folds, then cover the dough again with the bowl and let it rest for another 30 minutes. After the resting period, divide the dough with a dough cutter into 6 portions of about 10 oz each .
Take one portion of the dough at a time and stretch the edges from the outside to the inside , then roll it on the work surface to form balls and place them gradually in a proofing box . Close with the lid and let rise for about 6-8 hours at a temperature of about 64°F-75°F.
After the rising time, the dough balls will have doubled in volume . Stretch the first dough ball by gently spreading it with your hands , then press the dough with your fingers to form a disc about 7 inches in diameter, being careful not to thin the center too much .
Proceed in this way to stretch all the dough balls, then move on to filling: cut the provola into cubes , then soften the ricotta with a little milk and spread it on the surface, leaving the edges free . Distribute the provola cubes .
Add the cherry tomato sauce and the pesto . Finally, season with a grind of pepper .
Fold the dough in half to form a half-moon, then press well around the filling to eliminate all the air . Once you have filled all the calzones, you're ready to fry: in a large pot, heat the seed oil to a temperature of 356°F, then gently dip the calzone .
Fry until golden, turning the battilocchio on both sides and using a ladle to baste it with hot oil . Once evenly golden, drain and transfer to frying paper . Your Neapolitan battilocchio is ready to be enjoyed while still hot!
The Neapolitan battilocchio should be consumed right after frying.
If the dough is still wet at the end of the processing phase, you can flour it lightly and a little at a time.
If you don't have a proofing box, you can use a tray covered with slightly oiled plastic wrap.
