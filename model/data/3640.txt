Being able to serve one dessert that looks GOOD, tastes special, and gets everyone talking is the best kind of family secret—simple to share, always welcome around the table.
The first thing to do to prepare the two-clock cookies is to beat the egg whites until stiff with half of the sugar. Then finely chop the toasted almonds in a mixer , put them in a bowl, and mix them with the remaining sugar. Add the seeds of a vanilla pod and the Matcha tea , mix well and add the beaten egg whites .
Mix with a spatula until all ingredients are combined . Take some dough with a spoon (about 0.35 oz) and use your moistened palms to form balls .
Roll the balls in a container where you have placed the pine nuts (7-8). Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake the Matcha tea cookies in a preheated oven for about 15 minutes at 338°F.
If you wish to fully enjoy the aroma of Matcha tea, instead of completely covering the cookies, you can garnish them with just 1 or 2 pine nuts.
