instructions:
To prepare the chickpea flour gnocchi, first boil the potatoes. Place them in a pot, cover with cold water, and let them cook for about 30-40 minutes , until they are soft when pierced with a fork. Then drain them and, being careful not to burn yourself, mash them while still hot in a bowl . Using a potato ricer will allow you to avoid peeling them, as the peel will remain inside. Then place the chickpea flour in a mound on a work surface and add the potatoes in the center .
Knead everything with your hands , then recreate the mound and place the egg in the center . Work the mixture again .
until you get a uniform dough . Then take a portion and with your hands roll it into a rope about 3/4 inches thick .
Then cut it into pieces and with a light pressure of your thumb, pass the gnocchi over a gnocchi board to obtain the classic shape . If you don't have one, you can use the tines of a fork. Continue this way until you've used up all the dough, transferring the gnocchi onto a tray dusted with chickpea flour . The gnocchi are ready to be cooked in plenty of boiling water and will be cooked as soon as they float to the surface.
Chickpea flour gnocchi can be preserved raw by leaving them on a towel for a couple of hours at most; in this case, cooking will be slightly longer as they will have dried out in the air.
