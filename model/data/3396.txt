To prepare peach jam, start by choosing the fruits: pick well-ripened peaches with firm flesh, wash them under running water , peel them , and remove the pits .
Cut them into cubes about 3/4 inch , put them in a pot , and add the sugar .
Squeeze a lemon and add the juice to the pot . Stir and let them macerate for no less than 7 hours but not more than 12 hours.
Once the maceration time is over, place the pot on the stove and bring to a boil, stirring with a spatula from time to time . If necessary, skim the mixture so that your jam does not appear cloudy.
Let it boil over moderate heat for about 40 minutes , until it reaches 226°F (use a kitchen thermometer to measure the exact temperature). Stir occasionally to prevent the mixture from sticking to the bottom of the pot. While the jam is cooking, proceed with sanitizing the jars and lids, as indicated in the guidelines from the Ministry of Health at the end of the recipe. Once you've done this, return to your jam, which will now be ready: transfer it to a bowl to stop the cooking and pour it still hot into the jars you have sanitized, using a ladle and a jam funnel . Be sure to leave 1/2 inch from the jar's edge.
Screw the lids on tightly , but not too tight, and let them cool. You can turn them upside down or skip this step: thanks to the heat, a vacuum will still form, allowing the product to be preserved for a long time. Once the jars have cooled, check if the vacuum has been created correctly: you can press the center of the lid, and if you don't hear the typical "click-clack," the vacuum has been created . Your peach jam is ready to be enjoyed!
Peach jam can be stored for about 3 months, provided the vacuum has been created correctly and the jars are kept in a cool, dry place, away from sources of light and heat. It is advisable to wait at least 2-3 weeks before consuming the jam. Once each jar is opened, store in the refrigerator and consume within 3-4 days at most.
If you do not have a cool place to macerate the fruit with the sugar, perform the same operation in a large enough basin and leave it in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap. You can enjoy peach jam on slices of fresh bread or use it to garnish and fill your desserts!
The home preparation of preserves and jams can present health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create conditions and measures necessary to ensure the safety and suitability of foods, which, on the contrary, industrial procedures can assure to prevent dangerous contaminations. It is therefore important to scrupulously follow food safety instructions to reduce the risks, but always bear in mind that you can never achieve the same food safety presented by preserves and jams produced at a professional level. For correct preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the guidelines from the Ministry of Health .
