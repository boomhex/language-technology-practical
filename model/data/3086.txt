Schiacciata with mortadella is perfect for an easy but fancy get-together. Really, it's a winner. Straight from Emilia-Romagna, this dish combines the silky taste of traditional mortadella—a famous cured meat from Bologna—with a rich blend of cream and Philadelphia cheese. Seriously creamy. This delicious mix is spread over schiacciate, a type of Italian flatbread that’s crispy at the edges yet soft inside. You know, the good stuff. Commonly baked in Tuscany, this bread soaks up every bit of the mortadella mousse . What really sets it apart? The sprinkle of chopped pistachios on top—these nuts add a crunch and a slightly sweet bite that’s a perfect match for the mousse.
You’ll often see this dish at parties and family dinners across Emilia-Romagna, where folks love finger foods that highlight local flavors without taking all day to make. And look, why stress over complicated Italian antipasto recipes when this packs so much flavor into just a few bites? The combination of mortadella and pistachio appetizer on Italian flatbread feels special yet totally relaxed. Pretty much perfect. Each piece of schiacciate holds just enough mousse and chopped nuts to give you that moist, light, and slightly tangy taste—especially with really fresh pistachios. Some even add a touch of pistachio cream for extra flavor, making every bite more interesting. For sure.
Whether you’re serving this before dinner or at a casual gathering, it’s one of those snacks that always disappears first. I mean, who can resist? That smooth mortadella mousse, the golden edges of the bread, and those bright pistachios—this is Italian snack food at its best. And it’s so easy to put together, you'll want to make it every time friends come over. So next time you’re planning a get-together, remember this dish that gives you a taste of Emilia-Romagna ’s culinary flair without the fuss. Really really amazing.
To prepare the flatbreads with mortadella and pistachio cream, start with the mousse: in the bowl of a mixer, blend the mortadella , add the cream and the spreadable cheese (2-3),
then blend everything until you obtain a creamy and homogeneous mixture . Now transfer the mousse into a piping bag with a star tip: you are ready to assemble your finger foods. On each flatbread, place a tuft of cream , then garnish with a sprinkle of chopped pistachios and some freshly ground black pepper . Voila: the flatbreads with mortadella and pistachio cream are ready, very simple to make and impressive!
We recommend consuming the flatbreads with mortadella and pistachio cream immediately, to avoid losing their crispness, but if you wish, you can store them in the refrigerator for up to one day. The mortadella cream can be stored in the refrigerator, sealed in an airtight container, for up to a couple of days maximum.
If you prefer, you can prepare an excellent ham mousse using the same method to substitute for the mortadella cream.
