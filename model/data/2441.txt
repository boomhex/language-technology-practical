They want to add a fresh twist to their beloved cheeses. And the color? The jam’s unique look and slightly crispy texture come from the tomatoes, while ginger keeps it interesting—without taking over.

It's the kind of thing you bring out at a get-together, and suddenly everyone wants to know what's on their plate.

Whether you’re serving it with cheese, meats, or in creative desserts, it’s a versatile and exciting addition to any meal.
To prepare the green tomato jam, start by sanitizing the jars and lids, as per the guidelines of the Ministry of Health indicated at the end of the recipe. Wash the jars under running water . Take a large pot with high sides and line it with a clean dishcloth. Place inside the jars to be sanitized. Arrange more dishcloths in the gaps between the jars to prevent them from cracking due to any bumps during boiling . Cover the pot with water until it fully covers the jars. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Let boil for 20 minutes, then immerse the lids. Let them boil for another 10 minutes. Then turn off the heat and let them cool. When the water has reached room temperature, take the jars and let them dry on a dry cloth .
Wash the green tomatoes well under plenty of water and dry them with a cloth. Then remove the stem and cut them first into quarters and then halve each quarter .
Then take a large saucepan. Pour in the green tomatoes and the sugar . Grate the zest of two untreated lemons into the saucepan .
Now grate the ginger as well . Use a spatula to mix the ingredients well . Cook over high heat until the temperature reaches 226°F. Be sure to stir while cooking to prevent the jam from sticking to the pan. The tomatoes will take on a brown color due to the caramelization of the green tomatoes .
Finally, using a ladle, pour the green tomato jam into the sterilized jars while still hot , leaving 0.4 inches of space from the rim of each jar. Then close them well, but not too tightly , and let them cool . The heat from the jam will naturally create a vacuum, allowing the product to be preserved for a long time. Once the jars have cooled, check if the vacuum has been properly formed: you can press the center of the lid and, if you do not hear the classic "click-clack," the vacuum has occurred. Your green tomato jam is ready to be enjoyed!
The green tomato jam can be stored for about 3 months, provided the vacuum has been properly formed and the jars are stored in a cool, dry place, away from sources of light and heat. It is advised to wait at least 2-3 weeks before consuming the jam. Once opened, each jar should be stored in the refrigerator and consumed within 3-4 days at most.
For a sweeter jam with a less pronounced flavor, you can choose to omit the ginger. If you want to prepare it for tarts, you can also blend it with an immersion blender to reduce the tomatoes to a puree: an irresistible version!
Homemade preparation of preserves and jams can pose health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the conditions and measures necessary to ensure food safety and suitability, which industrial procedures can instead guarantee to prevent dangerous contamination. It is therefore important to carefully follow food safety instructions to reduce risks, but it should always be remembered that the same food safety cannot be achieved as in professionally produced preserves and jams. For correct preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the Ministry of Health guidelines .
These particular tomatoes had a moment of glory that brought them to the spotlight on tables when the movie "Fried Green Tomatoes" was released, based on the book "Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Café" (check out the recipe we propose for Fried Green Tomatoes ). In the latter, the recipe for preparing fried green tomatoes is indicated on the last page of the book.
