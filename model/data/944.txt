Beetroot gnocchi are a vivid burst of color—so pretty—and have this tender bite that's just fun. Really, really fun. It is a cool twist on classic homemade gnocchi from Northern and Central Italy. Instead of regular potatoes, we're using sweet, earthy beets. I mean, they make each dumpling eye-catching and full of flavor. In Italian kitchens, trying new gnocchi recipes is a thing, and beetroot pasta is one of the many ways to get creative with traditional dishes. And look, it gets even better.
You top them with confit cherry tomatoes —slow-cooked until they’re juicy and sweet—and toss them on top for a nice tangy contrast. Thing is, this mix of color and flavor really sets it apart from usual pasta. In some parts of Italy, they even finish these dumplings with a big scoop of stracciatella cheese —which is awesome for its rich, creamy texture. Melts right away. It’s one of those recipes where the ingredients do all the work—pretty simple but super tasty.
You'll see how the golden tomatoes stand out against the deep pink beetroot gnocchi. And the stracciatella cheese ? It just brings everything together with a moist finish. Seriously good. It pairs beautifully with fresh basil or a drizzle of good olive oil, and you know what? People sometimes swap in different cheeses or herbs based on what's around. If Italian food's your jam, this is a fun way to switch things up and see how easy it is to bring new flavors to your gnocchi.
Plus, after tasting the tender gnocchi, sweet tomatoes, and rich cheese, you might be inspired to try other twists—maybe with pumpkin or spinach. In the end, beetroot gnocchi with cherry tomatoes and stracciatella cheese gives you a plate that looks amazing and tastes even better. A fresh take on a beloved Italian dish. No question.
