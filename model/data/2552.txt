It's not just a cake; it's a piece of art that really brings people together in a way that's super enjoyable. And here's the thing: it's all about fun and flavor!
To make the chess cake, first prepare the dark base: coarsely chop the dark chocolate. Melt it in a double boiler and when it's melted, add the butter in pieces and let it melt. When the chocolate and butter are well combined, add the instant coffee , then transfer the mixture to a stand mixer.
Let the mixture cool slightly and add the sugar and the eggs beaten with a fork : turn on the whisk and mix. Add the milk ,
the grated orange zest and continue mixing. Finally, sift the flour directly into the bowl along with the baking powder and cocoa powder .
Mix with a wooden spoon or spatula to combine the mixture . Then butter and flour a 10 x 7 inch baking pan, pour the batter inside , and bake in a preheated static oven for 60 minutes at 320°F (if using convection oven, 284°F for 50 minutes). Once baked, remove the base and let it cool.
Meanwhile, prepare the light base: in a bowl, pour the eggs, sugar , and a pinch of salt. Beat them for about 20 minutes with an electric mixer, then add the oil , water, and continue working the ingredients with the electric whisks. Slice open a vanilla pod and extract the seeds,
then add them to the batter . In a small bowl, sift the flour, potato starch , and baking powder. Incorporate them into the batter, one spoonful at a time , and continue mixing with the whisks to combine all the ingredients.
Transfer the obtained batter into a 10 x 7 inch buttered and floured baking pan and bake in a preheated static oven for about 25 minutes at 356°F (or 320°F for 15 minutes if using a convection oven). Once baked, remove the cake and let it cool . Meanwhile, start preparing the buttercream by pouring the granulated sugar with the water into a thick-bottomed saucepan, place it over low heat, stirring occasionally with a steel spoon. When the sugar has melted, put a candy thermometer in the saucepan and, without stirring, bring the syrup to 250°F .
In the meantime, place the egg yolks in a stand mixer and start whipping them , add the sugar syrup in a thin stream , and whip until completely cooled. While the whipped yolks are cooling, cream the room temperature butter with a spatula. Then incorporate the seeds from a vanilla pod into the mixer , sift the powdered sugar and add it as well,
finally add the butter, one piece at a time , continuing to whip until the mixture is creamy . Cut the light base into 8 rectangles, each 1.2 inches thick .
and do the same with the dark one . Start assembling the cake: brush one side of the rectangle and place it on a serving plate with the brushed side facing down to adhere better.
Continue alternating the colors to create a first layer with 4 rectangles, brush the surface with the buttercream , and proceed with 3 more layers. Brush the entire surface and edges of the cake with the buttercream and place it in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. Take the ready-made sugar paste, roll it out on a work surface ,
then wrap it around the rolling pin and unroll it over the cake to cover it completely , adhere the paste on all sides, and trim the excess. Finish the chocolate decorations ;
with the help of a teaspoon, distribute dark chocolate flakes on each dark square and white chocolate flakes on the light ones . Your decorated chess cake is ready to be enjoyed !
Store the cake in the refrigerator for up to a couple of days. You can freeze it without the coating.
As an alternative to buttercream, you can use a dark chocolate ganache.
