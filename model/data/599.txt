Casatiello stracciato is, I gotta say, a must-have Easter treat in Naples . It hails from the lively Campania region down in Southern Italy. It's not just a savory bread ; it's like a slice of Neapolitan culture that really brings excitement to holiday tables. And you know what? Chef Roberto Di Pinto crafted this cool twist on the classic by mixing the filling right into the dough. So every bite—every single one—is filled with savory chunks of salame napoletano and rich bits of pecorino cheese. Seriously good. It's salty, it's tender, it's got that richness. The blend of half lard and half oil keeps the traditional taste but makes it lighter, more enjoyable.
Plus, we can't forget the “uova ingabbiate”—whole eggs on top, locked in with dough strips. This little touch sets Neapolitan Easter bread apart from others and, honestly, gives it a unique charm. Different spots in Campania have their own styles, but this stracciato version really captures family tradition—with a twist. Each moist, slightly golden slice is a perfect combo of chewy bread, savory salami, and that crispy egg topping. Pretty simple.
And here's the thing, it’s not just for holidays—people love it all year. There's always the debate: warm or room temp? Either way, it pairs well with Easter dishes like artichokes or roasted lamb. This bread is more than just food. It's like a snapshot of Neapolitan cuisine —full of stories, hand-me-down recipes, unique family touches. For anyone diving into a casatiello recipe or exploring traditional Italian recipes , this is more than cooking. It's a piece of Campanian heritage, really bringing people together with its rich, cheesy goodness and unmistakable style. Whether you're local or just visiting, tasting casatiello stracciato is like taking a bite out of Naples—so so filled with warmth, history, and a sense of belonging.

To prepare the torn casatiello, first, add the fresh yeast to the room temperature water and stir to dissolve it . Pour the mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a hook .
Also, add the other fats: oil and lard . Start mixing the ingredients at low speed and gradually incorporate half of the flour using a spoon . Once the flour is absorbed and you have a sort of batter, add the salt .
At this point, add the remaining flour all at once and continue working at medium speed. The dough should have a soft consistency, but not overly so. It will take about 10 minutes of mixing with the stand mixer . Alternatively, you can work with the stand mixer for 5 minutes and the remaining 5 by hand on the work surface. Once the mixing is complete, stop the mixer and transfer the dough to the work surface just long enough to shape it into a ball; leave it to rest on the work surface while you prepare the filling, there will be no need to cover it.
Remove the skin from the salami and cut it into cubes . Use a knife to remove the rind from the pecorino and cut it into cubes of the same size as the salami .
Take the dough , take a small piece (about 80 g) , and set it aside: you will need it later to seal the eggs on the casatiello. Slightly flatten the dough .
Place the cubes of pecorino and salami in the center , and work it with your hands until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated .
Sprinkle generously with black pepper (preferably freshly ground) and knead until fully absorbed . Now shape the dough to form a loaf .
When it is long enough , place the loaf into a pre-buttered 9.5-inch diameter bundt pan , joining and sealing the two ends .
Now place the raw eggs vertically in 4 well-spaced points of the casatiello, pressing them lightly . Take the reserved dough and work 8 pieces to form small cords . Place the cords over the eggs to cage them and create a cross .
Once finished, cover the casatiello with a clean cloth and let it rise at room temperature away from drafts for about 1 hour to 1.5 hours. Once the volume has almost doubled , bake your Neapolitan casatiello in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 75 minutes, placing the pan at the bottom of the oven. Once cooked, let it cool slightly, then gently remove it from the mold and place it on a serving plate. Your torn casatiello is ready to be shared with the whole family !
The torn casatiello can be kept well-covered for 3-4 days at room temperature in a cool place but well-covered with plastic wrap or under a glass dome.
If desired, it can be frozen once cooked and completely cooled with the eggs included.
For the filling, you can choose to add other cured meats such as bacon or ham and other cheeses such as scamorza cheese. It's best to avoid fresh cheeses with a stretched texture like mozzarella.
