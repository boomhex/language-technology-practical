How to make popcorn
ingredients:
Corn: 2.6oz(75 g)- for popcorn
Fine salt: ½tsp
Sunflower seed oil: 2tbsp(25 g)

info:
Difficulty: Very easy
Cook time: 10 min
Serving: 3
Cost: Very low

instructions:
To prepare the popcorn, pour a drizzle of oil into a large, thick-bottomed pot and add the corn kernels before heating . Turn on the heat to high, cover the pot with the lid , after about 3 minutes the popcorn will start popping, shake the pot and return it to the heat at medium, continue shaking frequently until popping stops: it will take about 10 minutes.
Once ready , add ½ teaspoon of salt (or to taste) , shake again so the popcorn gets well seasoned. Enjoy your popcorn hot !
Store at room temperature for a couple of days, sealed in an airtight container.
Given the simplicity of preparation, it's better to make only the amount you intend to consume, as freshly made popcorn is much tastier than those from the previous day. Popcorn can also be cooked without oil, but in this case, they will be less flavorful, and it will be hard to salt them since the salt won't stick to the popcorn.
