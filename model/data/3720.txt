Since regular cooks want reliability and that little touch of something festive, choosing a stuffed cockerel in fruit sauce feels like a simple yet impressive way to celebrate with people you care about most.
To prepare the stuffed cockerel in fruit sauce, start with the chestnuts. Boil them for about 30 minutes with the lid on , and as soon as they are cooked, drain them and remove both the shell and the skin . Finally, chop only 50 grams of them, while you can keep the rest whole .
Peel the apple and pear and cut them into cubes . Then chop 50 grams of prunes, which you can soften by soaking them in warm water for about ten minutes if they are too dry .
Finally, remove the casing from the sausages and crumble them too . At this point, in a larger bowl, combine 100 grams of apple cubes and 150 grams of pear cubes ,
then add the prunes and chestnuts . Chop the bay leaf, sage leaves, and rosemary needles and add them to the mixture along with the sausages, making sure to save a little of the chopped herbs to rub on the surface of the chickens .
Finally, pour in the brandy , adjust the salt and pepper , and mix everything well with your hands, or with a spoon if you prefer , and set aside the mixture which will be used for stuffing.
Meanwhile, flame the cockerels, this way you can remove any feathers that are still attached, to do this you can use a blowtorch or, if you don't have one, you can pass the chickens directly over the stove flame . Wash and dry the cockerels well and grease them, both inside and out, with soft butter .
Salt and pepper the surface and inside of the chickens , add a little of the aromatic chop and stuff them with the previously prepared filling .
Use string to close the cockerels so that the stuffing doesn't come out and gently massage them, sprinkling them with the remaining aromatic chop so that the aromas stick well to the skin. Place the hens in a not too large baking dish where you have poured a little extra virgin olive oil
and add the remaining part of the fruit, then the apples and pears , the chestnuts and prunes , and finally the brandy
and the broth and lay the bay leaves on the surface of the chickens . Bake at 392°F for about 80 minutes, making sure to occasionally baste the surface with the cooking juices, so the ingredients don't burn. Once cooked, you can serve the stuffed cockerel in fruit sauce piping hot .
It is recommended to consume the stuffed cockerel in fruit sauce immediately because the day after the meat can become tough, but if preferred, it can be kept in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for up to 2 days. If you use very fresh ingredients, you can also freeze everything.
If you love the scent of garlic, use it to flavor the surface of the chicken. You can also use chopped dried fruits to add a crunchy touch to the stuffing, such as almonds, pine nuts, and hazelnuts!
