So... You've gotta try a vegetarian poke bowl —it’s got all those fresh Hawaiian vibes with a twist that’s just perfect for when you're craving something light and plant-based. Seriously, it's good. Instead of fish, you’ve got colorful veggies and marinated tofu soaking up all those tropical and Asian flavors. And it's like a flavor bomb. The tofu gets so tender, especially after chilling in soy sauce, sesame oil, and maybe a hint of citrus. And listen, folks in Hawaii? They've been mixing things up with their poke bowls forever. Adding something like Inamona—a crunchy, nutty seasoning—and gomasio, this sesame salt mix, makes it really crunchy and gives a nutty finish.
Picture bright mango, cool cucumber, and maybe some avocado piled over rice or grains. You know, for a really healthy poke bowl recipe . It just works. Exploring these flavors in a vegan poke bowl is pretty much perfect for summer. It's cool, juicy, and full of those crisp textures. It’s like this amazing mash-up of Asian and tropical vibes. And folks in Hawaii totally dig it. They're all about the mix.
The plant-based poke bowl gives you so much freedom to get creative. You might throw in pickled radishes or even a quick seaweed salad on top. Adding some gomasio or an Inamona-inspired mix makes this meatless poke bowl way more interesting than just a vegetable salad. Without seafood, it works great as a tofu poke bowl or a vegetable poke bowl —for sure, it's awesome for anyone needing a break from fish but still craving that classic poke vibe. Eating this is like a mini beach trip somewhere warm. Thanks to all the zesty dressings and sweet pineapple or mango chunks, it feels like paradise.
You end up with a dish that’s light, filling, and super simple to make your own. No question. Doesn't matter which toppings you choose. It is a really really good fusion that captures the spirit of Hawaii, while offering a fresh, bright meal option.
To prepare the vegetarian poke bowl, start with the tofu. First, slice it and then cut it into cubes about 1/2 inch . Gather the pieces in a bowl and season with 3 tablespoons of soy sauce ,
the juice of half a lime , a cleaned chili pepper cut into rounds , black sesame seeds , and prep and
a pinch of Hawaiian red salt . Mix well and let marinate for an hour . Meanwhile, place the rice in a pot with plenty of boiling salted water .
As soon as the rice is cooked, drain it and season with a drizzle of sesame oil , then let it cool. In the meantime, move on to the vegetables, wash them all. Trim the zucchini, slice it ,
then cut into regular chunks . Peel the carrot and cut it into cubes of the same size . Remove the seeds from the bell pepper and cut it into chunks as well .
Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and use a mandoline to make thin slices of radishes and onions. Finely chop the nuts , transfer them to a bowl
and add the red salt and mixed sesame seeds . Mix, set aside, and proceed to cooking. Heat a skillet, pour in the tofu along with its marinade and sear over high heat until the liquid has evaporated.
Meanwhile, in another pan, pour a drizzle of sesame oil, add carrots, bell peppers, and zucchini . Season with the red salt and cook for a few minutes. They should stay crunchy and golden. Peel the mango and slice it thinly .
Do the same with the avocado, cutting slightly thicker slices . Now everything is ready, you just have to plate. Place the rice in a bowl, add the sautéed vegetables in one corner and the tofu next to them . In another corner, place the mango slices, those of avocado
the onion, radishes and cherry tomatoes. Season with a little lime juice and the nut and salt mix. The vegetarian poke bowl is ready, you just have to serve it .
It's recommended to consume the vegetarian poke bowl immediately. You can prepare rice, vegetables, and tofu in advance, but we suggest assembling the bowl at the last moment.
Enrich the poke bowl with seasonal fruits and vegetables!
