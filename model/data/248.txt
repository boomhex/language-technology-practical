Homemade Sardinian fregola can be stored in a glass jar in a cool, dry place for a month.
Coarse semolina is a type of flour obtained from grinding durum wheat, characterized by larger and rougher grains compared to fine semolina. Its granular texture allows for more rustic doughs, which better absorb seasonings and ensure a hearty and flavorful texture, making it essential for the proper preparation of this special pasta.
If you don't have a scivedda, you can use a bowl with high sides.
