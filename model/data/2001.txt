Imagine setting the mood for a cozy, romantic Italian dinner with this cake for two . It’s a delightful little mini tower of moist cocoa sponge—really really delicious—split into three layers to make sure every bite is a perfect blend of cake and creamy goodness. Italian desserts have this magical way of turning simple ingredients into something truly special. This one's no different. The filling is a rich blend of ricotta and mascarpone—which gives it a luxurious feel without being too heavy. And here's the thing: the delicate touch of pink peppercorns mixed into the cream? For sure, they add just enough spicy kick to wake up your taste buds and a splash of color that stands out beautifully against the dark cake and golden chopped hazelnuts. This mini cake recipe feels like a labor of love—really—though it’s all about using simple, quality ingredients and paying attention to the little details.
This small cake recipe is crafted just for two, so it’s perfect for an intimate occasion without worrying about leftovers or elaborate decorating. Italian desserts, you know, often keep things straightforward with honest flavors and a bit of fun. The chopped hazelnuts give you that crunchy contrast to the creamy filling, and the pink pepper? It adds a modern twist that's just right for Valentine’s Day. Plus, you don’t need to be a pastry chef to pull this off; it's all about making something sweet and meaningful, maybe for an anniversary or just to show someone you care. This dessert for two is a favorite—no question—because it’s easy to make, looks fantastic, and that pink pepper gives it that extra something. It’s the type of tender treat that graces Italian tables when you want to make an evening special—pretty much—using classic elements like pan di spagna and mascarpone in a fresh way. With its creamy layers, sweet ricotta, and that bright finish of spice, it’s a go-to for anyone who loves their small batch baking to have a bit of heart.
To make the cake for two, start by preparing the cocoa sponge cake: separate the yolks from the whites and place them in two separate bowls. Take the bowl with the egg whites, add half of the sugar and use an electric mixer to beat them until very stiff .
Now take the bowl with the yolks, add the other half of the sugar and beat with the electric mixer until they become light and frothy .
Combine the yolk mixture with the beaten egg whites and gently fold with a spatula from bottom to top to avoid deflating the mixture . Place a sieve over the bowl with the egg mixture and sift in the flour and baking powder .
Mix the dry ingredients into the egg mixture with the spatula, always making delicate movements from bottom to top, then also sift in the cocoa powder and mix again to incorporate it until you get a homogeneous, frothy, and lump-free mixture .
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) in static mode, then line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Take a 3.5-inch diameter ring mold, about 2.5 inches tall, and line the inside with a strip of parchment paper, making sure it sticks out about 0.2 inches . Transfer the sponge cake mixture into a piping bag, place the ring mold on the lined baking sheet, and fill it with the mixture up to about 0.4 inches from the edge . Bake in the preheated static oven at 350°F (175°C), on the lowest shelf, for about 35 minutes.
While the sponge cake is in the oven, you can whip the cream for decoration: combine the heavy cream and sugar in a container and whip with an electric mixer until it's nice and firm, then transfer it to a piping bag with a medium tip (smooth or flower) and store it in the fridge, so it is well-chilled when you use it to decorate the cake.
Once the baking time for the sponge cake is over (check with a toothpick that it is cooked inside), let it cool slightly inside the ring mold , then unmold it and gently remove the parchment paper lining . Let the sponge cake cool completely, in the meantime proceed to prepare the cream: place the pink peppercorns inside a sieve, position it over a bowl, and rub them with your fingertips to shed them; this way the outer shell will remain in the sieve, while the bowl will collect a powder that will be used for the cream .
Put the ricotta in a separate bowl, add the heavy cream and briefly mix with the electric beaters, then add the powdered sugar and continue to work with the mixer to blend all the ingredients well. Add the mascarpone and continue working the cream with the electric beaters.
Now extract the seeds from the vanilla pod using a smooth blade knife , then add them to the ricotta and mascarpone cream , along with the pink pepper powder you obtained earlier .
Gently mix with a spatula to incorporate all the ingredients and achieve a smooth, homogeneous cream , then transfer the obtained cream into a piping bag with a flat, ridged tip and store it in the fridge. Finally, place the hazelnut crumbs on a plate and mix them with the pink pepper powder, sifting it using the same method explained earlier , and set it aside.
At this point, the sponge cake will have cooled down, so place it on a cutting board and remove the top with a serrated blade knife ; the small cake will then be about 2.5 inches tall, so cut it horizontally into 3 parts, obtaining 3 discs each 0.8 inches thick . It's time to assemble the cake: if you don't have a turntable stand, you can use a fairly large bowl turned upside down on the work surface. Place the sponge cake base on the inverted bowl
and fill the surface with the ricotta cream you placed in the piping bag . Add the second sponge cake disc and fill this one too with the ricotta cream , then cover it all with the last layer of sponge cake, without filling it.
Now move on to coat the cake: place the piping bag nozzle on the outer side applying light pressure and simultaneously turn the bowl to cover the side surface of the cake evenly . Finally, use a spatula to smooth the surface, helping yourself by turning the bowl as a base and occasionally wetting the spatula with a little water .
At this point, stick a long toothpick into the cake to handle it without touching the coating, and gently roll it in the hazelnut and pink pepper crumb mixture until you evenly cover the cream . Take the whipped cream you left in the fridge and decorate the still unadorned surface of the sponge cake , adding red fruits to taste, a few mint leaves, and a grind of pink pepper: the cake for two is ready to be served !
You can store the cake for two in the fridge for up to 3 days. If you prefer, you can prepare both the sponge cake and the ricotta cream the day before: keep the sponge cake at room temperature, under a glass dome, without cutting it; the cream, however, should be stored in the fridge, inside a piping bag or in a small bowl covered with plastic wrap in contact. It's best to make the whipped cream for the top decoration at the moment.
If you have leftover ricotta and mascarpone cream with pink pepper, you can use it to make a dessert cup: fill a dessert glass with the cream, add a bit of whipped cream on top, and garnish with crumbled cookies... to celebrate Valentine's Day every other day!
