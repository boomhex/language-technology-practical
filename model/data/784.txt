And look, with porcini mushrooms and lentils coming together, you've got the same cozy vibe as a traditional meat ragù but with a cool vegetarian twist.
In Tuscany, they’re all about using fresh, local stuff, so swapping lentils for meat? Totally makes sense. Plus, a splash of unfiltered extra virgin olive oil right before serving just bumps up the aroma and gives it a little extra shine.

It’s so so good.

Feels like something a nonna would whip up to keep everyone full and happy. Plus, this sauce isn’t just for pappardelle. People often use it on other pastas or spoon it over polenta. Which is great.
