instructions:
To prepare the baked paccheri, first make the béchamel. Melt the butter in a saucepan , then add the flour and stir quickly, allowing it to cook for a couple of minutes. Add the milk and stir gently.
Season with salt and nutmeg . Continue to cook the béchamel until it has thickened and coats the back of a spoon . Remove it from the heat and set it aside. Prepare the broccoli: clean them to obtain 400 g (14 oz) of florets and rinse them well with cold water .
Drain the broccoli well and place them in a steamer basket. Fill a pot with water, add salt , and bring to a boil. As soon as it starts boiling, place the basket inside .
Cover and cook for about 10 minutes. Then transfer them to a bowl and cook the paccheri in the water below for 7 minutes . Meanwhile, take out some florets for decoration and mash the rest in the bowl with a fork .
Add the ricotta as well , mix well , and also add the gorgonzola . Mix again until you obtain a homogenous cream.
Now drain the paccheri and dress them with the cream you just prepared . Transfer the pasta thus seasoned into a baking dish. Spread the béchamel over the paccheri .
Also, add some pats of butter on top and arrange the reserved florets . Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F for about 15 minutes. Finally, turn on the grill for 5 minutes to help with browning. Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
You can store the pasta in the refrigerator for one day covered with plastic wrap. Before consuming it, you can reheat it in a hot oven at 300°F with a few pats of butter on top.
You can make the preparation even more delicious by adding crispy diced speck sautéed in a pan over high heat for a couple of minutes.
