Focaccia is one of Italy’s most beloved breads, known for its soft, airy texture and crisp golden crust. This simple homemade focaccia recipe is ideal for beginners and seasoned bakers alike, requiring just a few pantry staples—flour, yeast, olive oil, and salt—to create a light, flavorful bread. The dough is enriched with extra-virgin olive oil, giving it a rich taste and moist texture, while a sprinkle of fresh rosemary and flaky sea salt enhances its savory aroma. Whether served warm as an appetizer, sliced for sandwiches, or paired with cheeses and cured meats, focaccia is a versatile and irresistible addition to any meal. Baked to perfection, this easy yet authentic Italian recipe captures the essence of traditional focaccia while allowing for endless variations.
If you love our focaccia recipe, try these tasty variations too:
To prepare simple homemade focaccia, start by mixing the yeast with the sugar in a small bowl and then pour it, along with the flour, into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment . Turn on the mixer and gradually add the milk and water, which you have mixed together .
Next, add the oil, also gradually . Continue kneading until the dough starts to come together, then replace the paddle attachment with the dough hook .
Add the salt and continue kneading for about 15 minutes until the dough is well-kneaded: the dough is very hydrated so help yourself with a bench scraper to detach it from the hook .
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface, again using the bench scraper , and using the scraper give a couple of folds, i.e., lift one edge and bring it to the center . Then lift the other end and bring it to the middle and repeat once more.
Transfer the dough into a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the oven turned off with the light on and let it rise for 2 hours or until it has doubled in size . Grease a baking pan (we used a rectangular pan 14x11 inches), brushing the entire surface and along the edges carefully ,
pour the dough into it and grease your hands to prevent the dough from sticking . Start stretching it with your fingertips to distribute it until it covers the entire surface and the sides . Because this is a very hydrated dough, if you can't immediately fill the entire pan, let it rest for a few more minutes before continuing to stretch the dough.
Once done, cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for another hour in the oven turned off with the light on . After the time has passed, create dimples in the dough with your oil-greased fingertips .
Sprinkle with oil , some rosemary leaves, and some salt flakes . Your focaccia is ready to be baked in a static oven at 350°F for about 35-40 minutes, in the lower part of the oven (check the baking occasionally without opening the oven). Once baked , just take it out of the oven and enjoy it plain or stuffed!
To ensure you enjoy the focaccia at its best, it is recommended to eat it immediately. However, it can be stored for up to 2 days in a sealed bag; in this case, it is recommended to warm the focaccia in the oven for a few moments. You can also freeze the baked focaccia; once thawed, warm it before consuming.
Don’t have time for the rising? No problem! Let the dough rest in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap for up to 12 hours, the next day let the dough acclimate and then proceed as per the recipe. If you prefer a crunchier focaccia, once the dough is spread in the pan, go ahead with the baking; if you want a tall and soft focaccia, once you reach the final rise, do not create dimples but bake the focaccia immediately by simply greasing it and sprinkling it with salt and rosemary. And if you can't find salt flakes, coarse salt will do just fine!
