Spring vegetable frittata? It's a perfect example of how simple ingredients can turn into something really, really special. And look, in Italy , especially in the Central regions, it's a favorite during spring. Why? Because that's when tender peas, fava beans, and green beans are just amazing. These veggies? They blend beautifully with moist eggs and a nice handful of grated pecorino cheese, creating a golden, flavorful dish that's hearty yet light. You can enjoy it warm from the pan or serve it cold—which is great—as a picnic snack or family lunch.
What makes a spring vegetable frittata stand out is how it transforms basic ingredients into something crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The natural sweetness of the peas? So good. Plus, the fresh crunch of the beans is perfect. Adding pecorino is such a classic Italian move—it’s salty, brings the eggs to life, and makes every bite taste way, way more Italian.
Across Central Italy, people love this versatile dish. You can slice it into cubes for appetizers or pack it for a picnic. Serve large wedges with salad for a simple dinner, and it’s pretty much perfect. And you know, a pea and bean frittata is packed with protein and fiber, making it a pretty healthy frittata —without too much effort.
No need for fancy techniques—just chop up those fresh veggies and let them shine. It’s an easy frittata recipe that's perfect for breakfast, brunch, or even a quick meal after work. Some folks call it an asparagus frittata when asparagus is in season, but the core idea stays the same: use what’s fresh and local. Italian families love how this egg-based dish brings everyone together at the table—showing off the best of their regional farms and traditions.
It’s a soft, fluffy, and seriously satisfying way to enjoy more veggies, giving you a meal that makes you feel really good inside and out. With each bite, you’re tasting Italy's love for fresh, local ingredients and the joy of sharing a meal with loved ones. Really, it's a taste of home.
To prepare the pea, broad bean, and green bean omelette, start with the legumes. Remove the ends of the green beans and rinse them under running water . Then open the pods and extract the fresh peas, which you will keep in a bowl . Finally, split the pod in half and remove the broad beans. Then, remove the outer layer covering the broad bean seed by gently pressing with your fingers. If the color beneath the layer is light, the broad bean is fresh. If the color is black, you will need to remove the thin skin surrounding the seeds . For more detailed instructions on cleaning broad beans, consult the Cooking School: How to Clean Broad Beans, which you can find How to Clean Fava Beans .
Now take a non-stick pan, pour in a drizzle of oil, and add a peeled garlic clove . As soon as the garlic turns golden, remove it from the pan and add the peas. Cook them for 5-6 minutes , adding vegetable broth (read the recipe Vegetable broth ) to aid the cooking .
After 5-6 minutes, add the broad beans and cook for another 5 minutes, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Pour in a bit more broth to help with the cooking and to prevent the legumes from drying out. Then add the green beans and salt again . Cook for another 10 minutes until the legumes have softened.
Meanwhile, break the eggs into a bowl and beat them. Season with salt and pepper to taste and add the grated pecorino , then mix everything with a spoon or spatula.
Once cooked, let the legumes cool slightly, pour them into the egg mixture , and stir . Then transfer everything to a preheated non-stick pan .
Cover with a lid and cook the omelette over low heat for at least 6 minutes. Then turn the omelette using the lid , flipping it and letting it slide back into the pan, and cook the other side for another 3 minutes without the lid. Once it reaches a soft and compact consistency, the pea, broad bean, and green bean omelette is ready to be served and enjoyed , how? Warm, cold, or cut into cubes!
The pea, broad bean, and green bean omelette can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container or well covered with plastic wrap for up to two days. If the ingredients you use are fresh, you can freeze the pea, broad bean, and green bean omelette, even cut into cubes.
This recipe could be crowned the "queen of variations." Not surprisingly, it's an omelette, a dish with the superpower of versatility. Don't like broad beans, peas (even frozen ones are fine), or green beans? Great: choose the vegetables you prefer and use those... spinach, snow peas, or zucchini, for instance. Don't like pecorino? Replace it with another aged cheese of your choice. Can't do without the subtle onion flavor? Sauté the legumes with Tropea onion or a fresh spring onion.
