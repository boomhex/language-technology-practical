instructions:
Sautéed cauliflower is a side dish , easy, quick, and above all genuine. To give a lively touch of flavor, we've added chili pepper to the cauliflower , for a versatile and tasty side, the perfect accompaniment to home cooking "musts" like succulent meatballs or maybe a delicious baked sea bream. The longest part of the recipe will be cleaning the cauliflower as we chose a brief cooking time, to leave the cauliflower in the pan with its natural and pleasant crunchiness.
