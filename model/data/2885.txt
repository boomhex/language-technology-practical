instructions:
To prepare the chocolate crème brûlée, start by pouring the cream and milk (whole or partially skimmed) into a large saucepan. Heat them and add the dark chocolate . Then stir with a wooden spoon until the chocolate is completely melted and combined with the milk and cream.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, pour the egg yolk and add the sugar , stir with a spatula until you obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Then pour the melted chocolate over the egg and sugar mixture, stir thoroughly. Then transfer the mixture into ramekins or molds with a diameter of 4.5 inches. Place the creams in a baking dish with fairly high edges and pour in hot but not boiling water until it covers 2/3 of the ramekins .
Bake the chocolate crème brûlée on the top rack of the oven with convection baking at 356°F for 40 minutes. Then take them out of the oven when they are ready and sprinkle them with brown sugar. Put the ramekins back in the oven and turn on the broiler to caramelize the sugar on the surface, then serve them warm or cold as a delicious end to the meal!
You can store the chocolate crème brûlée in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer, you can flavor the crème brûlée with cinnamon or orange zest.
