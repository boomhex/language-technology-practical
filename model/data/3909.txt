Take some precooked red beets (you'll find them vacuum-packed in supermarkets), and using a smooth-bladed knife, remove their outer skin. Use a mandoline to cut them into thin slices directly into a bowl. Add the sugar, wild fennel seeds, white wine vinegar, and red wine, and gently mix until the ingredients are well combined. Let the preparation rest covered and cool for a couple of hours before serving, so the beets have time to absorb the marinade.
Sweet and sour beets with wild fennel will be even more aromatic if you prepare them in the morning to enjoy in the evening, and if you can't find fennel, you can substitute it with cumin.
Wild fennel, whose green leaves, flowers, seeds, and stems are used, grows spontaneously in Mediterranean areas and blooms in July/August. Various parts of this plant are used to cook fatty meats like porchetta, or to flavor salt-cured olives, rabbit roasts, snails, or to flavor sausages. Fennel is also used to prepare desserts, herbal teas, bread, liqueurs, etc.
