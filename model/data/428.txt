instructions:
To prepare baked swordfish with parchment cooking, first, pat the swordfish slices dry with absorbent paper . Wet and wring out the parchment paper and place it in a baking dish large enough , then place the swordfish slices inside .
Season with extra virgin olive oil, olives , garlic , salt, and pepper. Scent with aromatic herbs .
Pour the white wine , then close the parchment paper to wrap the fish slices . Meanwhile, preheat the convection oven to 356°F (180°C), then bake the swordfish for 25 minutes. Remove the baking dish from the oven and turn on the grill mode. In the meantime, remove the parchment paper to prevent it from burning and bake the fish again for 5 minutes until golden. Let the baked swordfish rest for a few minutes before serving it !
It is recommended to consume the baked swordfish immediately; if leftovers, you can store them for one day in the fridge.
You can further enhance the flavor of baked swordfish by adding cherry tomatoes, lemon slices, or parsley in the parchment.
