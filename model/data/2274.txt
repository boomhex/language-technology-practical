Hey there! So here's the thing: if you're looking for something a bit different, you gotta try beef medallions with apple sauce . It might sound a little unusual at first, but trust me, this dish is one of those really, really delightful surprises. Imagine tender beef medallions —kind of like filet mignon slices—paired up with a sweet and slightly tangy apple sauce, inspired by those old-school European traditions. Seriously, the flavor combo here is just awesome. And look, this pairing is actually pretty common in German and French kitchens, especially around the Alps. The real twist? The pancetta garnish. It crisps up beautifully—super crispy!—adding crunchy bites that go so well with the juicy beef.
The result is a main dish that hits all the right taste notes: bold beef, a pop of sweet apple, and just enough salty, savory goodness from the pancetta. Even people who are kinda skeptical about mixing fruit with meat find this beef medallions recipe tough to resist because everything just works together, you know? It's simple, but really satisfying.
And you know what? People usually think of apple sauce as a buddy for pork, but the idea of beef with apple sauce is actually loved in parts of Central Europe. The sauce isn’t overly sweet—it's a perfect balance, really—especially as the apples cook down and gain a bit of richness. Even hardcore fans of classic beef and gravy might find themselves going back for seconds.
This meal is all about quick cooking and letting those flavors shine through. Plus, it looks fantastic—golden apple sauce drizzled on top with pancetta scattered throughout. If you’re hosting friends or family, these beef medallions meal ideas will definitely spark some conversations. People are always curious about how the tender meat and fruity sauce complement each other. It’s a go-to for anyone who loves bold, unexpected flavors and a dish that’s full of character.
To prepare the beef medallions with apple sauce, start with the latter. Wash the apples, cut them into wedges, and peel them, removing the core . Dice them , set aside, and squeeze the lemon .
Pour the water into a pan, add the lemon juice , the sugar , and the apple cubes .
Bring everything to a boil, then add the cinnamon stick , cover with a lid , and let it cook for 10 minutes. At this point, remove the cinnamon stick
and blend everything until obtaining a puree. Adjust with salt and pepper, then add the cream and mix with a whisk to achieve a creamier consistency.
Once the apple sauce is made, take care of the beef fillets. Wrap them with bacon and tie them with string ; then insert rosemary sprigs, wedging them between the string and the meat .
Pour the oil and butter into a pan and let them melt over very low heat. Add the freshly prepared medallions , salt, pepper, wait 3-4 minutes until they are well seared, then turn the fillets .
Continue cooking for another 4-5 minutes, basting the fillets often with the cooking juices . At this point, deglaze with the red wine and wait a couple of minutes until the alcohol has completely evaporated .
Transfer the medallions to a plate and remove the rosemary sprigs and strings. At this point, take the apple sauce again: with the help of a spoon , create a base on the bottom of the plate, where you will place your medallions . Now all that remains is to serve your beef medallions with apple sauce!
It is recommended to consume the beef medallions with apple sauce immediately after preparation; alternatively, it is possible to store the meat and cream separately in two containers for a maximum of 1 day in the refrigerator.
Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of beef fillets, you can use pork. To further enrich the sauce, you can use spices like star anise or cardamom!
