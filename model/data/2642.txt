instructions:
To make the veal meatballs with lemon and marjoram, place the ground veal in a bowl , add the beaten eggs , the grated Parmesan cheese
and the breadcrumbs , also add the olive oil , the lemon juice , salt, and pepper,
flavor the mixture with freshly chopped marjoram and mix all the ingredients with a fork. When the mixture is homogeneous start forming the meatballs: take a portion of the mixture the size of a walnut and roll it between your hands to shape the meatballs. With these doses you will get about 24 meatballs, as you form them, place them on a tray lined with parchment paper .
Finally, pass each meatball in flour (10-11). Cook the meatballs: heat plenty of peanut oil in a pan, when the oil has reached the ideal temperature for frying (340-355°F) immerse the meatballs in the oil
cook them until they are golden, then drain them and place them on a tray lined with absorbent paper . The veal meatballs with lemon and marjoram are ready to be enjoyed hot !
Store the meatballs in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 2-3 days. Alternatively, you can freeze the meatballs either cooked or raw.
As an alternative to ground veal, you can use a mix of white or red meats.
