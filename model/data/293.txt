instructions:
To prepare the Swiss chard lasagna, start with the béchamel: pour the milk into a saucepan, add the nutmeg and salt, then heat it. Melt the butter over low heat in another saucepan . Add the flour all at once .
Mix vigorously with a hand whisk until you obtain a golden mixture, the roux . At this point, dilute the roux by first pouring in a little hot milk and then all the rest . Continue stirring over low heat until the béchamel thickens . Let the béchamel cool.
Clean the vegetables by cutting off the base of the stalks . In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil, add the Swiss chard , and season with salt and pepper.
Sauté the Swiss chard in the pan for 5 minutes, or until they are soft . Set aside and cut the mozzarella into cubes . Assemble the lasagna: spread a layer of béchamel on the bottom of a 7x9 inch baking dish .
Place the sheets of green pasta and then another layer of béchamel . Now distribute a portion of the cooked Swiss chard .
Continue with the mozzarella , provola, pecorino, and Parmesan , then lay down a second layer of pasta . Continue alternating layers of béchamel, Swiss chard, and cheeses until you get a total of 4 layers.
The last layer will be made of béchamel , Swiss chard, mozzarella, and grated cheeses , but without provola. Bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for 35 minutes. Remove the Swiss chard lasagna and let them cool before serving !
The lasagna with Swiss chard can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 2-3 days.
They can be frozen either raw or cooked.
You can replace the Swiss chard with spinach or kale, add ricotta instead of some cheese for a creamier touch, or opt for a Vegan Bechamel made with almond milk.
Here we opted for dry pasta sheets, but you can make homemade pasta following our recipe: Green pasta with spinach . If you have leftovers, you can use them to prepare traditional green lasagna with Bolognese ragù!
