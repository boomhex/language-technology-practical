instructions:
To prepare the pomegranate liqueur, start by deseeding the pomegranate, taking care to remove the thin white skin that wraps the seeds . Pour the seeds into a jar with an airtight seal and add the alcohol .
Close the jar and let it macerate in a dark and dry place for 12 days. Shake the jar every day. After 12 days, retrieve the mixture and pour it through a strainer to collect the juice . Prepare the syrup: pour the water into a saucepan .
Add the sugar and heat the syrup without bringing it to a boil, so that the sugar dissolves . Let the syrup cool. Once cool, pour the macerated alcohol here .
Mix to combine and pour the pomegranate liqueur into a bottle . Let it stand at room temperature for 20 days before serving it .
The pomegranate liqueur can be stored for 90 days in the refrigerator or at room temperature if it's not too hot.
To add an aromatic note, you can add a cinnamon stick to the pomegranate seeds during maceration.
Homemade preparation of preserves and jams may pose health risks. In a domestic setting, it is not possible to create the necessary conditions and measures to ensure food safety and suitability, which industrial procedures can guarantee to prevent dangerous contamination. It is therefore important to strictly follow food safety guidelines to reduce risks, but always keep in mind that you will never achieve the same level of food safety as professionally produced preserves and jams. For proper preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the guidelines from the Ministry of Health .
