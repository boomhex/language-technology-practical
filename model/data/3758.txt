Sweet mornings just feel easier with jam-filled croissants on the breakfast table—kids and adults both seem to go for that flaky , golden look and soft texture you get when using Pillsbury crescent rolls for homemade-style taste. Their pretty, crescent shape and sweet burst of jam inside gives families those little bakery vibes without the need for anything complicated.DELICIOUS is the word that comes to mind seeing that golden brown color next to coffee or juice, especially when you finish things off with a simple swirl of cream cheese icing for a brunch treat everyone talks about. Whether you need family-friendly ideas or just want a crowd-pleaser, these jam-filled croissants check every box for weekend breakfasts, brunch gatherings, birthday mornings, and those quick weekday moments when something great lifts the mood. Reliable, nice flavors from fruit jams mean home cooks always hit the spot—easy, sweet, and just a little bit special with every batch. It's always amazing how something that LOOKS good on the table usually disappears fastest, and with so many flavors to try, there's always a reason to smile over another breakfast or easy snack.
Families juggling busy schedules definitely appreciate anything that works as easy breakfast recipes —that’s a huge part of why store-bought dough is so popular here (especially with picky kids). No worries about complicated steps; it's simple to pop them out, choose a favorite jam, and get a warm, soft pastry that beats anything from a box.Don’t forget, simple swaps in jam flavor or a little drizzle of cream cheese icing on top keep things fun and fresh.No wonder it's often on the list for brunch recipes or potlucks—there's just something about that flaky, golden finish and nice fruity filling that brings people together.Plus, using a baking sheet (or any tray that fits what you have) means these fit right onto your lineup for cozy weekend tables, family get-togethers, and those times when you want an easy win everyone will eat.So EASY, seriously…these croissants prove that breakfast or brunch at home can be delicious , pretty, and fast all at once, which keeps even the busiest family coming back for another batch.
Put the flour, butter cut into pieces, and sugar into the bowl of a mixer. Mix until the ingredients are reduced to small crumbs, then add the egg yolks, yogurt, lemon zest, and cinnamon. Turn on the mixer again, then take out the dough and knead it by hand for a few minutes, form a ball that you will wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for half an hour.
After the half-hour has passed, take the dough out of the refrigerator and roll it out with a rolling pin to form a sheet about 1/16 inch thick, then cut it into squares with 2 inch sides.
Place a tablespoon of jam in the center of each square and fold it to form a triangle. Seal the edges by pressing them lightly with your fingers, then roll the triangles onto themselves. Slightly bend the tips forward to give them a shape similar to a croissant.
Place the cookies on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake the cookies for 15 minutes in a preheated oven at 356ºF. Let the cookies cool outside the oven and then sprinkle them with powdered sugar before serving.

These croissants will be even better if left to rest for at least 24 hours before being eaten; the dough will become crunchier and at the same time soft due to its filling.
