To prepare the potato soup, start by bringing the Vegetable broth to a boil in a pot, then take care of the potatoes: peel them and slice them , then cut each slice into cubes of about 0.4 inches .
Now move on to preparing the sauté: chop the onion then, in a large pot, pour the oil and add the chopped onion , letting it simmer for about ten minutes, occasionally moistening it with a ladle of hot broth to prevent it from burning .
After 10 minutes, add the potato cubes . Then tie the thyme and rosemary sprigs (saving one thyme sprig) with kitchen twine and add them to the pot . Cover everything with the boiling broth and let it cook for 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, remove the aromatic bouquet using kitchen tongs and add the rice . You can use either Arborio or Carnaroli rice. Add the boiling broth again until all the rice and potatoes are covered .
Then add the tomato paste and mix well to incorporate it . Also add the salt
and the pepper and continue cooking for another 20 minutes, adding more broth as needed. When the rice and potatoes are cooked, add the Grana Padano cheese and give a final stir of broth , and if necessary, adjust with a bit more pepper.
Add the thyme leaves from the sprig you previously set aside and stir one last time before serving : your potato soup is ready to be enjoyed!
The potato soup is good freshly prepared, but it is also excellent when consumed the next day: let it cool and store it in the refrigerator before reheating.
Freezing is not recommended.
You can make your potato soup richer by adding a couple of zucchini and carrots during cooking: flavoring with chili pepper, marjoram, and chives will give it an even tastier flavor.
