So, here's the deal: this flan ai frutti di bosco is a really fun twist on the classic French pastry. Perfect for when you want a touch of elegance—pretty much every time, right? The flan’s known for being both delicate and rich, and this version takes it up a notch with vanilla-flavored condensed milk cream . It sets into something wonderfully moist and rich. Really, really good. Plus, it's topped with juicy wild berries like raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries. And the flavors? Sweet and tangy—can't go wrong with that.
And look, the base is super simple. Just a dough that holds the creamy filling perfectly. It’s such a satisfying mix of textures: a bit of chew from the pastry, creamy custard in the middle, and those soft berries on top. To be honest, while flan might seem straightforward, this flan ai frutti di bosco really elevates things with both flavor and presentation.

Whether you're into dolce con salsa al cioccolato or just love a good French dessert, this flan will definitely satisfy and delight.
To make the berry flan with chocolate sauce, start by preparing the shortcrust pastry: put the flour, cold butter pieces from the fridge , a pinch of salt in the blender and blend everything until you get a sandy and flour-like consistency. At this point, place the mixture on a surface in the classic fountain shape, gradually add cold water and knead quickly until you obtain a compact, firm, and fairly elastic dough.
Once ready, wrap your shortcrust pastry in a sheet of plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 40 minutes. In a saucepan pour the fresh milk, the condensed milk , the sugar
and the vanilla pod , heat over low flame for 5 minutes to dissolve the sugar, then in a separate bowl place the sifted flour, add the eggs
beat the mixture with the whisks, then add the seeds of the vanilla pod and gradually pour in the two previously heated milks , always stirring until you get a fairly liquid, smooth, and lump-free mixture . Take the shortcrust pastry, roll it out into a round sheet about 1/16 inch thick on a lightly floured surface ,
wrap the pastry around the rolling pin and then unroll it onto a baking pan with fluted edges and a diameter of 11 inches, previously buttered and floured . Trim the excess edge with a serrated pastry cutter and pour the condensed milk cream into the cake ,
distribute the berries all over the surface and bake in a static oven at 392°F for 35 minutes (or in a fan oven at 356°F for 25 minutes). In the meantime, prepare the accompanying sauce: chop the white chocolate, then pour the fresh cream and condensed milk into a saucepan , heat the mixture and then incorporate the chopped chocolate
and stir with the whisk to melt it , you will obtain a smooth and thick sauce that you will transfer into a small bowl . Meanwhile, the flan will have finished cooking, take it out of the oven and let it cool, then serve it accompanied with the chocolate sauce
Store the berry flan and white chocolate sauce in the refrigerator for up to 3 days covered with plastic wrap. It is possible to freeze the flan both raw and cooked.
