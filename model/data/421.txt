instructions:
To prepare the trofie with cod sauce, start by desalinizing the capers (just rinse them well under running water), then pour the canned cherry tomatoes into a tall jug and blend them with an immersion blender until you get a smooth sauce . In a large pan, heat a little oil and sauté the garlic clove in its skin .
Then pour in the cherry tomato sauce, season with salt and pepper, and cook covered for about 20 minutes . On the cutting board, place drained Taggiasca olives and desalinized capers .
Chop everything finely with a knife , then do the same with the parsley . Set aside and dice the cod fillet .
Add the cod to the tomato sauce , stir and continue cooking with the lid on for another 5 minutes or until it softens (it should flake when touched with a spoon) . At the end of cooking, add the chopped capers and olives .
Stir and remove the garlic clove. Meanwhile, boil the trofie in plenty of salted water to taste , then drain al dente and transfer it to the pan with the sauce , then cook for another 2 minutes.
Turn off the heat, season with the chopped parsley , toss everything with a drizzle of oil and dish up your trofie with cod sauce adding more finely chopped fresh parsley to taste .
It is recommended to consume immediately; if there are leftovers, you can store them in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 1 day.
Freezing is not recommended.
You can also flavor the trofie with cod sauce with some basil.
