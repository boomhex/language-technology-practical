To prepare the baked chicken thighs, first place the thighs in a baking dish and add the oil , the dry white wine , and the chopped sage with a knife .
Also add the rosemary and unpeeled garlic . Thoroughly soak the thighs in the emulsion and let them rest for a few minutes. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes about 1 inch, then wash and pat them dry with a clean cloth.
Place them in the baking dish , season with salt and pepper, and mix everything . Bake in a preheated convection oven at 350°F for 85 minutes, turning the chicken occasionally. Once cooked, extend cooking for another 5 minutes on grill mode. Let cool slightly and your baked chicken thighs are ready to be served .

You can prepare the chicken in advance and let it marinate in the fridge for 1 hour covered with plastic wrap. If you love intense flavors, you can add curry, sweet or smoked paprika. Besides potatoes, you can enrich the baking dish with carrots, onions, zucchini, or bell peppers cut into pieces.
