To prepare the banana liqueur, first peel the bananas and slice them: you will need 350 g (12.3 oz) of fruit pulp . Transfer them to a glass jar and add the alcohol , then close with an airtight lid and let it rest for a week at room temperature, shaking the mixture occasionally .
After the maceration time , filter the liquid into a bowl : you should obtain about 400 g (14.1 oz) of banana-flavored alcohol .
At this point, cut the vanilla pod in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with the blade of a small knife . Pour the milk and cream into a small pot ,
then add the vanilla pod with its seeds and the sugar . Heat the mixture without bringing it to a boil, stirring to completely dissolve the sugar .
Let it cool, then add the banana-flavored alcohol , mix well and transfer the resulting mixture into a liqueur bottle . Store your banana liqueur in the refrigerator and serve it chilled !
The banana liqueur can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 months.
If you wish, you can flavor the milk with other spices like cinnamon or turmeric!
