Savory pan-fried radicchio is an easy and quick side dish: a tempting and original idea for cooking this purplish-colored vegetable, characterized by a typical bitter taste. A feature not always appreciated by everyone, we decided to soften it with a pinch of curry, for a pleasant spicy note. The crumbled feta also adds a touch of freshness to the sautéed radicchio in a pan and creates a delicious color contrast. Great to pair with meat and fish main courses, savory pan-fried radicchio can also transform into a unique dish with a bit of creativity!
Try these radicchio sides as well:
To prepare savory pan-fried radicchio, first wash the head of radicchio and remove the base, keeping the stem intact . Cut the head in half and then into quarters .
Transfer the radicchio to a bowl and season with oil , salt, pepper, and curry . Gently massage with your hands to distribute the seasoning evenly .
Heat a non-stick pan, place the radicchio and sear it for a few seconds over medium heat, then cover with a lid ; this way a bit of moisture will form, preventing the radicchio from burning. Cook for 4-5 minutes, occasionally shaking the pan, then turn the radicchio and continue cooking for another couple of minutes. Transfer the radicchio to a plate and garnish with crumbled feta .
Finish with chopped parsley, a drizzle of oil , and a grind of pepper . Your savory pan-fried radicchio is ready to be served !
Savory pan-fried radicchio can be stored in the refrigerator for one day in an airtight container.
If you wish, you can also add a pinch of cumin to enhance the spicy note. For a more scenic look, you can use tardive radicchio!
