instructions:
To prepare the lactose-free cake, first pour the eggs into a bowl , add the brown sugar , and mix for one minute with an electric mixer .
Continue mixing while slowly adding the oil . Then add the sifted flour , whole wheat flour ,
hazelnut flour and the sifted baking powder . Mix again with the beaters until you obtain a smooth batter. Then add the yogurt ,
the oat flakes and raisins . Continue mixing with the electric beaters until they are well incorporated .
Pour into a pan measuring 8.5 inches at the bottom and 10 inches on the surface, previously greased. Garnish the surface with oat flakes and brown sugar .
At this point bake in a static oven preheated to 356°F for 30 minutes, then switch to a fan-assisted mode and bake for another 5 minutes to slightly caramelize the surface of the cake. Remove from the oven and let it cool before removing from the pan and serving .
The cake can be stored for 2 days at room temperature under a glass dome. It can also be frozen after baking.
