Deglaze with white wine and let it evaporate completely, then add the cherry tomatoes and cook over medium heat for about ten minutes. In the meantime, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and add the tagliatelle .
Drain the pasta directly into the sauce and stir it in the pan, adding a ladle of cooking water if necessary . Flavor with grated Parmesan .
Drizzle with olive oil , then season with chopped parsley and a grind of pepper . Mix everything well and turn off the heat.
Plate it and finish with some grated pecorino . Your pasta with bacon is ready to be served !

You can replace fresh cherry tomatoes with canned ones and follow the same procedure.
If you prefer, you can use only Parmesan or only pecorino; in the latter case, the flavor will be more intense.
