To make the tea bag cookies, start by preparing the shortcrust pastry: take the butter out of the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes to soften; then proceed by placing the flour and the chopped butter into a mixer . Blend briefly until you get a sandy and floury mixture; transfer it to a bowl and add the sifted powdered sugar , seeds from a vanilla bean, two egg yolks, and a pinch of salt .
Mix all the ingredients first in the bowl with your hands , then work the mixture on a floured surface until it becomes compact and elastic. As soon as you achieve this, form a ball , wrap it well with plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator to rest for about half an hour .
After the indicated time, take the dough out of the refrigerator and roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 1/4 inch . Using a knife, cut rectangles of 2 inches x 1.5 inches, then chamfer two corners to create the classic tea bag shape . Transfer the tea bags onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and using a wooden skewer, make a hole at the top of each tea bag . Now bake the cookies for 15-16 minutes at 350°F in a static oven.
Meanwhile, melt 3.5 oz of dark chocolate in a double boiler , stirring continuously to prevent lumps from forming, then transfer the melted chocolate into a small bowl. Once the cookies are baked and completely cooled, dip the bottom part of each tea bag into the chocolate , place the cookies on a sheet of parchment paper and let them dry for 5-10 minutes. At this point, prepare two small "tea labels" for each cookie and a thin kitchen twine (or a thick sewing thread) about 8 inches long . The labels, made of paper or lightweight cardstock, can be created in various shapes and decorated as desired (depending on the occasion for which these cookies are prepared): we made them hexagonal and decorated with the GialloZafferano logo...
When the chocolate on the cookies is completely dry, proceed with the final decoration: pass the twine through the hole made earlier and tie the two ends together . Apply glue stick on the inside of the two labels and join them , after inserting the string in the center (making sure to leave the knot outside the labels). Your charming and fragrant tea bag cookies are ready: you will impress your guests by serving them with excellent tea for a refined and original snack .
We recommend consuming the tea bag cookies on the same day, but if you like, you can store them in a sealed container for a couple of days.
You can prepare the shortcrust pastry in advance and freeze it wrapped in plastic wrap, then assemble the tea bag cookies later.
