Got pizza fans at home? This dish doubles as barbecue chicken flatbread when you want that extra kick (swap in a BBQ drizzle, or try cheddar for a new twist). Since flatbread recipes work with a big range of sides, everyone finds something on the table—maybe a mixed salad, some fresh fruit, or just more slices of cheesy, golden flatbread. Home cooks seem to notice how these street corn flatbreads always show up fresh, with a slightly crisp bottom and a good stretch of cheese—important for picky eaters who want both soft and crispy in every bite. Feels reliable (usually disappears fast), always turns out great , and fits right in with family meals all week long—pretty easy to see why this one sticks around in busy households looking for quick flatbread recipes, fun meal ideas, and memorable dinner options.
To prepare the flatbreads with chicken breasts and corn, start by making the spice mix, combine them all in a blender , turn it on and grind everything until you get a homogeneous powder ; take the chicken breasts, cut them in half and remove the small bones and any fat parts; cut the chicken breasts into 4-5 portions
and sprinkle them with the obtained spice mix to cover them as much as possible . Heat two tablespoons of oil in a non-stick pan and place the spiced chicken breasts in it ; brown them well on both sides and continue cooking until the inside is cooked and still tender; set the chicken aside and let it cool slightly. Now prepare the corn; drain the corn from the preserving liquid and place it in a bowl; add the juice of half a lemon and the chopped chili pepper without the seeds .
Soften the Greek yogurt by mixing it with a spoon until it becomes creamy . Then heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and warm one flatbread at a time for a few moments on each side, it should remain soft to be able to close it Piadina Romagnola (Romagna-style flat bread) Spread the Greek yogurt on the flatbread with a spatula , cut the breasts into many strips and place them in the center of the flatbread,
finally add the corn ; proceed to close the flatbread, starting from the bottom and folding the flatbread flap over the chicken , then close the first side and then the second over the first . Proceed in the same way for the other flatbreads and enjoy them while still warm!
Instead of Greek yogurt, for a creamier and velvety taste, you can use fresh spreadable cheese such as goat cheese or Philadelphia, or even some crème fraîche. An overseas idea is to use soft wheat tortillas instead of flatbreads and heat them like the flatbreads themselves.
