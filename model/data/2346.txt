instructions:
To clean the scorpionfish , first open it by slicing the belly with a knife: start from the head and cut all the way down to the tail , taking care not to damage the flesh, then remove the entrails .
Once the entrails are removed, rinse the scorpionfish well under a stream of fresh water to remove any residues. Proceed to cut all the fins: with scissors, cut the pectoral fin , the ventral fin ,
the lower belly fin , and the dorsal fin . Then, scale it with a knife, starting from the tail and moving towards the head, inserting it into a plastic bag to prevent the scales from scattering.
Then rinse thoroughly under running water to remove any remaining scales , make a cut with a sharp knife along the back , and make an incision near the caudal fin to facilitate filleting the scorpionfish.
Start filleting by opening the scorpionfish with your hands while sliding the blade to detach the first fillet and set it aside for any preparations. Do the same on the other side. This way, you will have obtained the scorpionfish fillets useful for your preparations. If necessary, you can remove the skin by cutting it off with a sharp knife, sliding it between the skin and the flesh along the entire length of the fillet.
Being a very delicate fish, if not consumed immediately after purchase, the scorpionfish can be stored in the refrigerator for a day in an airtight container after being cleaned and filleted. If desired, you can store it in the freezer after cleaning it for up to three months.
With the scraps from cleaning the scorpionfish, you can make an excellent fish stock, seasoning it with pepper, a clove of garlic, parsley, and thyme, and use it to flavor your fish dishes. If you have leftovers, you can store it in the freezer in small cups and defrost it as needed.
