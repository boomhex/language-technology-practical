instructions:
To prepare the salmon fillet with tomatoes and thyme, start by skinning and deboning the salmon from which you will obtain 4 cutlets to salt and pepper .
Now, chop the thyme and set aside 4 sprigs. Wash the tomatoes and blanch them in boiling water for about 15-30 seconds. When the tomatoes are cold: peel them , remove the excess water, and dice them .
Place the salmon cutlets in a non-stick pan with a bit of oil and cook over high heat for 2 minutes on each side with a crushed garlic clove. Now, deglaze with the double malt beer and let it evaporate until you obtain a thick sauce. Add the tomatoes and chopped thyme and let cook for about 5 minutes (do not overcook, the tomatoes should not fall apart). Serve your salmon fillet and its dressing on a serving plate and garnish with thyme sprigs.
