instructions:
Salmon mousse is a delicious appetizer ready in a few minutes, ideal to serve on black bread canapés during the Christmas holidays. This mousse is really simple to prepare and requires few ingredients: smoked salmon, ricotta, and fresh cream. Enhance your salmon mousse canapés with sprigs of dill and lumpfish roe!
To prepare the salmon mousse, start by finely chopping the ricotta together with the smoked salmon in a mixer . Wash the dill and chop it with a knife, then add it to the mixture . At this point, combine everything, season with salt if needed, and pepper to taste. Whip the fresh cream until stiff peaks form and incorporate it into the salmon cream with a spatula, being careful not to deflate it .
Using cookie cutters (we used flower-shaped ones), cut shapes out of the slices of black bread , then toast the bread in the oven or in a non-stick pan to create a crunchy crust . Spread the salmon mousse on the crostini and serve, garnishing with sprigs of dill and fish eggs . For an even more refined touch, you can place the mousse in a piping bag with a star tip and create dollops on the crostini! Enjoy your meal!
