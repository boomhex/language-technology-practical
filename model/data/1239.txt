Calabrian fritters, or cuddrurieddri , bring a bit of southern Italy right to your table, especially during the holiday season. I mean, they’re so so good. In Calabria, particularly around Cosenza, these traditional Calabrian recipes pop up every Christmas Eve, making the whole house feel extra warm and welcoming. And look, the dough gets its unique texture from potatoes, making each bite a little more tender than your average ring-shaped bread. People love that. Folks in Calabria love passing down this recipe, which always seems to come out when families gather, laugh and share food.
Thing is, there’s something about these Italian fritters that makes them perfect for any part of the meal. Sometimes they show up with cold cuts and cheese, other times you’ll spot them as a quick bite at street stalls. Really popular. They’re a big deal in the world of Calabrian appetizers and hold a special spot in the hearts of locals who grow up eagerly waiting for this dish each year.
If you dive deeper into Calabrian cuisine, you’ll find there’s even more to cuddrurieddri than just the classic ring shape. Some families opt for vecchiarelle , which are like little panzerotti stuffed with anchovies and caciocavallo cheese, all wrapped up in that same potato dough. When you break one open, the filling comes out melty and savory, mixing perfectly with the soft dough. Really, it’s so delicious. These Calabrian fritters don’t just taste good—they bring back the feeling of big holiday gatherings, everyone working together in the kitchen, and the scent of golden fried dough floating through the house. In Calabria, you’ll find other specialties like crispelle and polpette di melanzane, but cuddrurieddri has a way of standing out.
Whether you eat them plain, dip them in something tangy, or stuff them with cheese and anchovies, this is one of those authentic Italian fritters that always gets people excited. No question. Every bite kind of makes you feel connected to those old Calabrian traditions, even if you’re just sharing them at your own table far from Italy. Whether enjoyed during festive occasions or as a really really good treat, these fritters offer a taste of Calabrian heritage. For real.
To prepare the cuddrurieddri, first place the potatoes to boil . After 30-40 minutes, depending on their size, they will be cooked; drain them and while still hot, mash them with a potato masher , collecting the puree in a very large bowl . In this case, there will be no need to peel them because the skin will remain inside the potato masher.
Pour the lukewarm water into a bowl, add the salt and mix . Add the crumbled yeast and mix again .
Pour this liquid into the potatoes and mix with a spoon until you get a cream . Add all the flour at once and start kneading with your hands .
Then transfer the mixture to a surface and continue working until you get a homogeneous mixture . Using a dough scraper or a knife, cut pieces of about 5 oz and with your hands shape them into balls .
Place them on a tray where you have set a dish towel, spacing them apart . Cover with another dish towel and let them rise for about 30 minutes .
At this point pour the seed oil into a pan and heat it to reach a temperature of 340°F. Then lift the first ball and, by inserting your fingers in the center, create a hole by slightly widening them. If they stick too much, you can moisten your hands. Immerse the first donut in hot oil and move it using a ladle. By inserting the back of the ladle into the donut hole, you can widen it further.
Cook for about 2-3 minutes, turning the donut occasionally until golden brown. Drain it from the oil and transfer it to a tray lined with kitchen paper . Continue this way until all the cuddrurieddri are cooked and serve them hot !
It is recommended to consume the cuddrurieddri immediately. Alternatively, they can be stored in the fridge for one day or frozen and reheated in the oven before serving.
And for a sweet version? Roll the donuts in sugar while still hot, as if they were doughnuts!
