Now pour the Vov into a small pot and heat it over low heat for 5 minutes, then add the brandy and turn off the heat, slightly swirling the pan to mix .
Fill the glasses with the liqueur up to about two-thirds , then add the whipped cream . Your Bombardino is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the Bombardino immediately.
If you wish, you can garnish the Bombardino with a dusting of unsweetened cocoa! Instead of brandy, you can also use whiskey or rum.
It seems that the Bombardino was born in Livigno at the hands of a young man from Genoa who struggled with the harsh mountain temperatures. The name derives from the comment of the first person who tasted it, exclaiming “Wow! It’s a bomb!”.
