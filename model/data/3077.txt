Asparagus flan from Central Italy? Oh, it's something special. You take fresh, green asparagus and turn it into this super soft, creamy dish with a bit of a crispy edge—really really good. For real, since ancient Roman times, folks have loved asparagus for its unique taste. It pairs perfectly with sweet spring onions and the classic, salty pecorino cheese from the region. The baking gives it a slightly golden exterior—so good—holding in a flavorful, tender center. Imagine it as an asparagus custard with more character.
And you know what? Adding a warm parmesan cream on top just amps up the richness. Each bite gives you a moist, melt-in-your-mouth sensation. You can totally get creative with decoration—delicate asparagus tips or shaved cheese make it look special and hint at what’s inside.
When you’re hosting a get-together or aiming to impress without too much fuss, this asparagus tart is just the thing. Seriously. The combo of pecorino and parmigiano is all over Italian spring vegetable recipes, especially in Umbria and Tuscany. Thing is, it brings together simple ingredients to create something that feels refined and a little indulgent.
Unlike an asparagus quiche or an asparagus soufflé, it’s not too heavy or eggy. Nope. But still offers a creamy, smooth bite. The flan strikes a balance between rustic and elegant, making it a top choice for vegetarian appetizers that feel a bit fancy.
Plus, you can have fun with it—try different cheese shavings or maybe some crispy fried onions for decoration. This savory flan always turns out kinda special and makes any meal feel like a real occasion. Whether you’re a fan of traditional Italian cuisine or just love experimenting with flavors, the asparagus flan is sure to impress. It's simple yet elegant and a tasty addition to any menu. It captures the heart of Italian culinary artistry. Enjoy it as a refined starter that balances simplicity and elegance. Really, let your creativity shine through in every presentation. And the sauce? Perfect.
To prepare the asparagus flan, start by cleaning the asparagus (for more details, see the Cooking School: how to clean asparagus, which you can find here) : peel the stem with a potato peeler or gently with a small knife, working vertically from top to bottom, until the stem turns white, removing the green filamentous part. Slice the stalk into rounds and set the tips aside .
Take the tips and cut them lengthwise into halves . Put a drizzle of oil in a non-stick pan and sauté the halved tips for a few minutes . Turn off the heat and set them aside to use later in the flan decoration. Then clean the fresh scallions and slice them .
Once the scallions are sliced, place them in a non-stick pan with a drizzle of oil and sauté them until golden . Then, add the sliced asparagus and cook, adding a bit of water or broth occasionally to prevent sticking . Season with salt and pepper to taste and cook over medium heat until no liquids remain.
Transfer the cooked sliced asparagus to a blender and blend until you obtain a creamy mixture . Transfer the asparagus cream to a bowl and add fresh cream .
Also add the grated pecorino cheese and lightly whipped egg whites to the mixture. Mix everything together and set aside. Then take 5 steel molds with a capacity of 6 oz and butter them evenly with a brush to uniformly coat the sides of the molds . You can also use aluminum molds found at the supermarket.
Pour the obtained mixture into the molds and place them in a small aluminum baking dish, filling it with water halfway up . At this point, bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 45 minutes (if using a convection oven, bake at 320°F for 35 minutes) until the surface becomes slightly golden .
Let the asparagus flan cool slightly and carefully unmold it by detaching it from the edge with a small knife ; to assist, you can dip the mold in boiling water to help the edges detach better from the mold. Decorate the asparagus flan with the tips you sautéed and set aside, unleashing your creativity (20-21). Your asparagus flan is ready to be served and enjoyed!
Store the asparagus flan in the refrigerator for 3-4 days in an airtight container or wrapped with plastic wrap. You can freeze the already cooked flan and defrost it when needed.
Note for lovers of strong flavors: if the natural asparagus flan doesn't seem enough, enrich it! You can accompany it with a parmesan cream or add diced cooked ham directly to the mixture. In both cases, it's finger-licking good.
