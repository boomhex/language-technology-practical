instructions:
Bavareisa is this legendary drink from Piedmont in northern Italy, with a rich, rich history in the city of Turin . Back in the 1700s, it was pretty much the go-to breakfast drink for folks hanging out in those fancy cafés. You know, sharing big ideas and really enjoying their mornings. So here's the thing, the Bavareisa recipe involves mixing thick, rich hot chocolate with a shot of strong coffee. Really good stuff. But what makes it super special is that light, creamy foam on top—made with milk, cream, and sugar. It gives you a silky finish that's just a little sweet. When you take that first sip, it’s warm and comforting but feels a bit fancy, like something you’d find in those historic glass cups from way back in the day. Turin’s café culture still shows this tradition, and you can almost picture the elegant crowd from back then as you enjoy it.
People still rave about the Bavareisa dessert and how it eventually turned into the bicerin. Locals now enjoy it in a smaller glass. Ernest Hemingway even called it one of the 100 things worth saving in the world. For real, that says a lot about its charm. And look, the Bavareisa preparation hasn’t changed much over the years—it’s all about getting the layers just right. You know, a rich, chocolatey base, that smooth coffee in the middle, and a cloud of fluffy cream on top. Seriously good. Each café in Turin might have its own twist, but they all stick to those classic Bavareisa ingredients . And listen, you’ll see people savoring it as a treat any time of day, not just at breakfast. Plus, it pairs perfectly with a little pastry. If you’re looking for something comforting and a bit special, the traditional Bavareisa is one of those drinks that really really brings the old Turin vibes right to your table. It makes you feel connected to its bright history and cultural significance. Next time you’re in Turin, don’t miss the chance to taste this historic delight—seriously, don't miss it.
To prepare the bavareisa, melt the dark chocolate (in pieces or chopped) in a bain-marie and mix it together with the milk and cream . Melt thoroughly to achieve a smooth, creamy chocolate without lumps . Once ready, keep it warm.
Move on to the topping preparation, place the cold cream, cold milk, and sugar syrup in a bowl , then whisk the ingredients together to achieve an aerated, creamy mixture but not whipped , which you'll store in the refrigerator.
Meanwhile, prepare the coffee with the moka pot: to make excellent coffee, fill your moka pot's boiler with cold water, preferably low in calcium, making sure not to exceed the safety valve (otherwise you'll get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee, forming a small mound that you'll level by tapping the filter on the table with decisive movements (8-9). Do not press with the spoon, nor make holes on the surface.
Tightly close the moka pot so that the coffee doesn't leak from the sides while rising, and place it on a low, steady flame to achieve a rich coffee. As the coffee rises, a thick foam will form : we recommend not letting the coffee bubble for too long to keep its sweetness and aroma intact. Your coffee is ready: before using it, stir it directly in the moka pot with a spoon to make the coffee more homogeneous .
When the coffee is ready, for each cup, pour into a bowl 2.8 oz (80 g) of still-warm chocolate and add 1.8 oz (50 g) of coffee , approximately a small cup, and stir to mix the ingredients well .
Pour the well-heated mixture into a medium glass and top with the cream topping, which should be very cold, just out of the fridge: pour about 0.68 oz (20 ml) over the chocolate using a spoon so that the topping rests on the coffee, as it should form a layer and not mix with the chocolate . Do not stir the bavareisa but drink it as is : you'll taste how good it is!
You can store the cream topping for one day, well covered, in the refrigerator. Consume the bavareisa immediately.
You can also make sugar syrup at home if you can't find it ready-made, by dissolving equal amounts of water and sugar together.
