and mix everything well . Then boil the orecchiette in plenty of salted water , once the pasta is cooked, pour it into the bowl along with the yogurt cream and vegetables,
and mix everything together . Finally, garnish by adding the chopped parsley and basil and plate the orecchiette with yogurt and zucchini, serving them piping hot .
