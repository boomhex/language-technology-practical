And if you are also lovers of soft tarts, just like us, don’t miss these recipes:
To prepare the soft tart (base), in a bowl, pour the soft butter in pieces and start working it with an electric mixer. As soon as it has softened, add the sugar and continue to beat the mixture until it becomes creamy. Add the first egg and work with the electric mixer until it is well absorbed.
Then add the second egg and work until it is also completely amalgamated. Now add the baking powder and part of the flour . Mix again with the electric mixer.
Then add the remaining flour and mix with a spatula until you get a homogeneous mixture .
Now pour it into a 9-inch smart mold, previously buttered, and level it with an offset spatula . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 25 minutes. Once the tart is ready, take it out of the oven and let it cool at room temperature . When it is completely cold, you can turn it over onto a plate and fill it as you prefer!
The soft tart will keep for 2 days under a glass dome.
Flavor the base of the tart with lemon zest or vanilla.
