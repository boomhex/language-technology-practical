Piri piri chicken is just—honestly—a must-try dish. With roots in Portugal and a spicy kick from African influences, it's super super flavorful. The magic? It’s all about the bold, tangy sauce. Made by blending spicy chiles with smoky paprika, garlic, vinegar, and oil, this sauce is the heart of the dish. It generously coats the chicken before grilling. And look, it's not just a sauce; it's transformative.
Usually, a whole chicken gets split down the middle. Skin and bones stay intact, giving you that crispy, flame-licked exterior. Inside? So so juicy. The result? A Portuguese grilled chicken that's tender and full of flavor. Perfect for anyone who loves a spicy chicken recipe —without the fuss of complicated steps or hard-to-find ingredients. Really good stuff.
In Portugal, this dish is a staple at family gatherings and street food stalls—served with fries and fresh salad. The piri piri marinade really packs a punch while letting you enjoy the sweet, smoky char from the grill. Thanks to African chili peppers from places like Angola and Mozambique, this dish feels both traditional and a bit adventurous. Across Portugal, you’ll find variations—some go heavy on garlic, others crank up the heat. But they all keep that fiery, simple spirit. Which is great.
This grilled chicken recipe is perfect when you want something different yet comforting. Even if you’re not a fan of too much spice, you can adjust the heat. Still enjoy those golden, crispy edges and that bold, tangy flavor in every bite. For those stepping out of the culinary norm, this is definitely a dish to try for your next dinner plan. Really, give it a go!
To prepare piri piri chicken, start with the chilies. Rinse the chilies under running water, pat them dry with a kitchen towel, and place them on a cutting board. Make an incision at the end with a small knife, removing the stem , then slice each chili in half lengthwise . Finally, scoop out the inside with the help of the knife to remove the seeds .
Transfer the sliced and cleaned chilies to a blender , add a whole peeled garlic clove , and salt to taste .
Continue by pouring in the extra virgin olive oil , then cut an untreated lemon in half and squeeze it with a citrus juicer . Add the lemon juice to the rest of the mixture .
Add the sweet paprika powder and the vinegar . At this point, blend for a few seconds until you obtain a thick and homogeneous mixture , which you will store in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Now focus on the chicken: place the whole chicken, not deboned and with skin, on a cutting board and cut it in half, making an incision in the breast (13-14) and being careful not to break the bones; you can also perform this operation with poultry shears if necessary. Finally, try to open the chicken as much as possible with your hands .
Then heat the griddle and, in the meantime, grease the surface of the chicken with extra virgin olive oil . As soon as the griddle is hot, place the oiled chicken on it . To aid cooking, place a weight on top of the chicken: here a cutting board with a pot full of water was used , then cook the first side for about 20 minutes over high heat.
After this time, turn the chicken to the other side with a spatula (19-20) and cook for another 20 minutes over high heat, without placing any weight on top. Then take the piri piri sauce you set aside and brush it over the entire surface of the chicken .
Once the other side is cooked, turn the chicken again with a spatula and spread the piri piri sauce on the other side, continuing to cook for about 4 minutes . Then turn the chicken one more time and let it cook for about 5 minutes, at which point your piri piri chicken is ready to be served hot !
You can store piri piri chicken in the refrigerator for 2-3 days in an airtight container or well covered with plastic wrap. Piri piri chicken can be frozen either cooked or raw without the sauce, otherwise, it may lose its spicy flavor.
If you want to mellow the spicy flavor of piri piri chicken, you can brush the chicken with wildflower honey during cooking and serve it with basmati rice. Additionally, piri piri chicken is perfect for being served with French fries or lamb's lettuce salad!
