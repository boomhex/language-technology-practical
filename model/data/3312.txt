Vellutata di carote viola—really interesting stuff, right?—is a soup that captures your attention even before you taste it. You know, the deep purple color of this crema di carote viola is just so striking against the usual carrot soups. It’s really something. And here's the thing: it's all thanks to the unique purple variety. Originally, carrots were purple before the Dutch made orange popular for the House of Orange. So, when you're making this soup, you're kinda tapping into a slice of Italian food history.
Plus, with its creamy texture, the subtle flavor really really stands out. I mean, the combination of purple carrots, leeks, and potatoes makes a vellutata di carote viola that's mild and sweet, but never overpowering. And the rosemary? It adds this gentle, fresh boost to the mix. For sure, it's not just beautiful—those purple carrots are packed with antioxidants, making you feel extra good.
In Italy, people often add a swirl of sour cream or Greek yogurt, creating a vellutata di carote viola con panna acida or a vellutata di carote viola con yogurt greco . Honestly, it adds a tangy kick. Unlike some vegetable soups that might taste a bit bland, this one has a velvety finish—thanks to the potatoes. Pretty simple.
This soup is a favorite in Italian homes, especially when purple carrots are in season. You might even hear stories about how these natural colorants have been used in ancient recipes. Thing is, it’s not just the color that makes it special—the delicate taste is perfect for those who want something light yet satisfying. Whether you call it a zuppa di carote viola or just a fancy carrot soup, it pairs beautifully with rustic bread. Really, this is the kind of soup that surprises you with its look and taste—simple, nostalgic, and definitely a conversation starter at the table.
The rich aroma and inviting color make it a perfect addition to any meal, showing not just a piece of history but also a burst of flavor that's both comforting and refreshing. Pretty much perfect. All in all, it's a dish that resonates with both tradition and modern taste.
To prepare the purple carrot velouté, start by peeling the potatoes and cutting them into fairly small cubes , peel the purple carrots as well, remove the ends and cut them into slices . Wash the celery stalk, remove the strings and chop it finely. Put the extra virgin olive oil in a saucepan, add the chopped celery
and the leek that you have washed and cut finely , let everything wilt over low heat. Then add the potatoes , the carrots
and the two sprigs of rosemary and sauté them for a few minutes to enhance the flavor. Then add the broth and continue cooking. When the vegetables are cooked (it will take about 40 minutes), remove the two sprigs of rosemary and blend them finely in a mixer to obtain a creamy consistency; if the cream is too thick, add a ladle of hot water . Finally, adjust the salt. Serve the purple carrot cream hot or warm, accompanied by a spoonful of sour cream or low-fat yogurt!
If you can't find purple carrots, you can replace them with orange ones to achieve the same result!
