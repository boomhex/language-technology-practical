instructions:
To make the pandoro cakes with apples, walnuts, and Nutella®, melt the butter over very low heat and let it cool slightly. Wash and dry the apples, cut them in half, remove the core, and then cut them into small but regular cubes without peeling them . Coarsely chop the walnuts and place them in a bowl along with the apples .
Then season with sugar and orange juice . Sauté the apples in a pan over medium-high heat for a few minutes, stirring often.
They should be slightly caramelized . Cut the pandoro into thin slices about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) thick . Cut out 24 disks with a 2.75-inch (7 cm) cookie cutter .
Use 12 disks for the bottom of the cakes and another 12 for the top . Brush the muffin tin spaces with half the melted butter . Line them with the disks, pressing them well onto the bottom and sides .
Toast them in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for 5 minutes . Fill them with the caramelized apples and cover with another pandoro disk .
Brush the surface with more melted butter and bake again at 400°F (200°C) for 8-10 minutes. After this time, remove the cakes from the oven , let them cool slightly, and then remove them from the mold by turning them onto a cutting board.
Garnish each cake with 0.5 oz (15 g) of Nutella® , spreading it with a teaspoon. Add a little of the leftover filling, a sprig of red currants , and a mint leaf. The pandoro cakes with apples, walnuts, and Nutella® are ready to be enjoyed .
Store the pandoro cakes without cream for up to 3 days in the refrigerator. Freezing is not recommended.
These cakes can also be made with panettone!
