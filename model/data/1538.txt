Basil focaccine brings a bit of Liguria right into your kitchen with its aromatic and soft bite-sized bread rolls. And the thing is, in this region along the Italian coast, folks really love taking classic focaccia and turning it into homemade focaccine packed with the fresh smell of basil. When that basil gets mixed straight into the dough, you end up with little rolls that are moist and a touch tender inside, with a hint of herby flavor in every mouthful. Really good stuff.
Shape them as small discs, triangles, or even playful squares, and you’ve got breads that stand out at any gathering. The basil focaccine recipe is about capturing that fragrant basil and using it to make bread that feels cheerful and inviting, the kind that just begs to be shared at a picnic or set out as an appetizer when friends swing by. In Liguria, it’s common to see these on the table alongside a meal, soaking up extra olive oil or paired with salty cheese and tomatoes.
Thing is, many say Italian mini focaccia is the secret star of any relaxed meal, especially when you want something a bit special but still easygoing. It’s not just about the flavor, but the playful ways you can serve them—kids love the different shapes, and adults go back for seconds thanks to the crispy golden outside and soft inside. That Italian tradition of adding herbs right into the dough gives every bite a little boost—making the homemade focaccine more than just bread—they become treats you look forward to. Super tasty.
People across Liguria and beyond enjoy these as a tender snack during a seaside stroll or as a side with soup and salad. And here's the thing, an easy focaccine recipe like this lets you enjoy the best of Italian bread without any fuss, and that fresh basil aroma is sure to get everyone excited.

To prepare the basil scones, first wash and dry the basil leaves. Then place them in a blender , add the oil , and blend it all together
until you get a cream . Then pour the flour into a bowl, add the dry yeast , and add half of the water .
Mix and add the basil sauce . Mix again, add the salt , and the remaining water. Work with a spoon,
then transfer to a surface and continue kneading until you get a smooth and firm dough . Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap . Let rise at room temperature for about an hour.
When it has doubled in volume , transfer it to a lightly floured surface and flatten it with your hands .
At this point using a rolling pin, roll it out to a thickness of 0.6 inches . Using a 2.4-inch round cutter, cut out 35 circles .
Transfer them to baking sheets lined with parchment paper, arranging them neatly and spacing the scones apart. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for an hour. Brush the surface with some oil and bake in a static oven at 356°F for about 15 minutes on the middle rack. Remove from the oven and serve your scones while still warm!
The scones can be prepared in advance and frozen once cooled. Otherwise, they can be stored under a glass dome for 1 day.
With the same dough, you can make a large focaccia to cut into squares.
