instructions:
To prepare the savory pies with robiola, start with the base, the savory shortcrust pastry: in a food processor, add the flour, then add the cold butter from the fridge cut into pieces , the coarse salt , and the egg .
Close with the lid and run the mixer until you obtain a crumbly mixture . Transfer the mixture onto a floured surface and quickly work it with your hands to form a dough ball .
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour . After this time, roll out the savory shortcrust pastry on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1/5 inch. Cut out 4 bases of 4 inches in diameter , then cut strips of 1 1/5 inch to use as the edge .
Place the 4-inch disks on a baking sheet, insert the shortcrust bases , and create the edges with the strips .
Drizzle whole cherry tomatoes with a little oil and salt and mix well . Place the cherry tomatoes inside the shortcrust shell until filled. Finish with Taggiasca olives and bake in a static oven at 392°F for 20-25 minutes until the shortcrust is golden brown.
Remove from the oven, let cool slightly, and then remove the pies . Let them cool at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Finish with fresh robiola , a few leaves of fresh oregano, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil .
