To make the egg sandwich, first, place the eggs in a saucepan, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil . After 6 and a half minutes from boiling, drain 4 eggs and transfer them to a bowl with ice water : they will have the consistency of soft-boiled eggs and will be placed 1 in each sandwich. Drain the remaining eggs after 8 and a half minutes from boiling and immerse them in another bowl with ice water : they will have the consistency of hard-boiled eggs.
Clean and finely chop the shallot . In a bowl, pour some water with a few drops of white wine vinegar and soak the chopped shallot for a while . This will help to reduce the strong taste.
Finely chop the pickles , the chives , and the parsley. Mix the aromatic herbs in a small bowl and also add the dill by hand-picking the leaves .
Peel the hard-boiled eggs and separate the whites from the yolks . Transfer the yolks to a sieve and press with the back of a spoon to crumble them .
Add the mayonnaise , the whole grain mustard , and the chopped aromatic herbs .
Also add the chopped pickles and the hot sauce . Mix everything with a whisk and season with a few drops of vinegar .
At this point, chop the hard-boiled egg whites with a knife and add them to the mixture . Mix well to incorporate them, then season with salt and pepper .
Finally, add the drained chopped shallot and mix again to combine . You are ready to assemble your sandwich: cut 8 slices of sandwich bread and remove the crust.
Spread a tablespoon of the egg salad on the first slice , then place the soft-boiled egg in the center and cover with another tablespoon of egg salad .
Close with the second slice of bread . Now you need to wrap the egg sandwich in parchment paper so you can enjoy it more comfortably: you can now cut it in half with the help of a serrated knife . Repeat the procedure to make the other 3 sandwiches. Your egg sandwich is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the egg sandwich immediately.
The leftover egg salad can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to one day in an airtight container.
We used brioche bread characterized by a particularly soft consistency, but if you prefer, you can use another type of sandwich bread, preferably milk-based.
Personalize the egg salad by adjusting the amount of herbs, Tabasco, mustard, shallot, and vinegar to your liking. It's also great served on toasted bread crostini!
