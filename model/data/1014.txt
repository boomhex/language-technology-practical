To prepare the sausage and potato flatbread, first peel the potatoes, then cut them into cubes of about 1 cm (approximately 0.39 inches) . Place a pot full of water on the stove, bring to a boil, salt , and boil the potatoes for about 10 minutes , they should be tender but firm.
Chop the rosemary needles . Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan, add the well-crumbled sausage , and brown it for about 5 minutes .
When the potatoes are ready, drain them directly into the pan , adjust with salt and pepper , and flavor with the chopped rosemary .

Heat the flatbread in a non-stick pan for 30 seconds , then turn it over with a spatula and heat it for another 30 seconds on the other side. At this point, place the hot flatbread on a cutting board and fill it with the stuffing
Lift the flatbread from one edge, fold the side edges of the dough to prevent the filling from spilling out , and roll it up . Cut the sausage and potato flatbread in half and serve it hot .
We recommend consuming the sausage and potato flatbread immediately.
Instead of rosemary, try flavoring the filling with paprika!
