Pappardelle with hare is one of those classic dishes that feels like a cozy hug from the past. Really, it brings the rich flavors of autumn in central Italy right to your table. And you know, in Tuscany and Umbria , this recipe is super, super cherished. Especially when the air cools and you start craving something hearty and warming. And the sauce? It's all about hare, a type of wild game with a tender, deep flavor you just don't find elsewhere.
Those long, flat pappardelle noodles really catch all that moist and rich sauce. Each bite? Special. This hare ragu recipe simmers for hours, letting the meat get so, so soft, while the sauce thickens—brimming with earthy, woodland flavors. Pretty much like autumn on a plate. In this region of Italy, food isn't just eating—it's about tradition, sharing stories, and passing down something comforting that's been loved for generations.
You'll often see Tuscan hare pasta on tables when families gather on Sundays or during fall and winter holidays. It's the kind of dish that makes you want to linger around the table, savoring the flavors and the moments. Thing is, what makes this dish different from other traditional Italian pasta dishes is its use of local ingredients—like hare hunted from nearby forests and fresh pappardelle often made at home. And look, some towns even add a splash of red wine or fresh herbs picked that same day, giving each version of pappardelle alla lepre its own unique twist.
The result? A savory, golden sauce with just enough tangy notes to keep things balanced. Whether you call it hare stew pasta or just the wild game pasta from central Italy, it’s a meal that wraps you up in old-school comfort. For sure, it brings everyone together, just like folks have been doing in Umbria and Tuscany for ages. This dish really, really captures the spirit of Italian culinary tradition, celebrating the beauty of shared meals and cherished memories. And here's the deal—it is seriously good.
To prepare the pappardelle with hare, start by making the ragù. Wash the celery and carrot. Then peel and trim the carrot, remove the outer strings from the celery, and clean both the onion and the garlic, halving them to remove the core. Finely chop the rest . In a casserole, preferably cast iron, pour the oil and add the chopped onion, celery , and carrot .
Finally, add the garlic . Sauté everything over very low heat, stirring often, for 6-7 minutes. When the soffritto is ready, add the minced hare meat and brown over medium heat, stirring occasionally for about 4-5 minutes.
Once the meat has changed color, add the finely chopped rosemary and bay leaves . At this point, slightly increase the heat and deglaze with the red wine .
Continue stirring until the alcohol has completely evaporated. Then adjust with salt and pepper, reduce the heat, pour in the tomato purée , water, and stir again .
Cover the ragù with a lid and let it cook for about 4 hours on very low heat; it should simmer, and you can stir it very few times just to ensure it doesn't stick to the bottom. Once ready, transfer it to a very large pan. When your ragù is ready , cook the pappardelle in plenty of boiling, salted water to taste .
Drain the pasta and pour it directly into the large pan where you transferred the ragù , mix everything together and serve your pappardelle with hare still hot !
Pappardelle with hare is excellent when eaten just after being made! If you have leftover ragù, you can store it in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 2-3 days; alternatively, if you used all fresh ingredients, it is possible to freeze it.
By preparing the ragù a day in advance, all the various flavors will meld together and create an irresistible ragù! Once cooked, you can let it cool at room temperature and then store it in the fridge!
