instructions:
To prepare the ricotta and apple cake, start with the apples. Wash them well, peel them , and using the appropriate tool, divide the apple into 8 wedges, simultaneously removing the core . Now cut each wedge into two or three slices about 0.5-0.6 inches thick .
Gradually transfer the apple slices to a plate and pour the juice of a lemon over them . Mix well and set them aside; this way, they won't turn brown. Now sift the flour into a bowl .
Then sift the cornstarch and the baking powder into the same bowl. Mix and set aside. Break the eggs into a large bowl and add the sugar .
Work with electric whisks until they become light and frothy . Then add the grated lemon zest .
Take the ricotta and quickly work it with a fork to soften it . Add it to the batter and mix with the whisks on low to incorporate it.
Continue adding the dry ingredients little by little , alternating them with milk and oil until all ingredients are used up.
You should obtain a smooth batter without lumps . Pour it into an 18-20 cm pan previously lined with parchment paper . Arrange the apple slices on top, starting from the outside .
Place them in a radial pattern, slightly overlapping and gradually moving towards the center until it is completely covered . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about an hour, on the central shelf of the oven. Always perform the toothpick test before taking the cake out of the oven. Remove it from the oven and let it cool before removing the cake from the pan. Then slightly heat the honey and use it to brush the cake, making it glossy .
The cake keeps at room temperature under a glass dome for about three days.
For an even more delicious and crunchy surface, you can replace the honey with a generous sprinkle of brown sugar, to be spread over the apples before baking the cake.
