Quaresimali from Liguria are such a really good presence in Italian homes every spring. Honestly, they bring a little sweet tradition to the table. These Italian almond cookies are tied to Easter, and you know what makes them different? They skip butter and other animal fats. Which is great. Perfect for the Lenten season when many folks in Italy want something light yet full of flavor. The standout in this Quaresimali recipe is the almond flour. It gives the cookies a moist texture and a really really pleasant aftertaste, unlike regular biscuits. In Liguria, some people get creative with colorful fondant sugar on top—making the cookies look perfect for Easter. Plus, some families fill them with a bit of soft fig jam in the center, adding a tender and slightly fruity touch. So good!
These Lenten cookies are steeped in tradition. Kids often join in making them, especially around Easter. Honestly, getting everyone involved is part of what makes these traditional Italian cookies so special in Ligurian homes. Usually shaped into simple rounds, but in places like Tuscany, you’ll find Tuscan Quaresimali shaped like letters. The Genoese style sticks to classic round or oval shapes. Pretty simple, yet tasty. Biting into one of these crispy little treats, you get that nice almond flavor with just a hint of sweetness from the sugar or jam. For real. Quaresimali go really well with coffee or tea. They make any Easter gathering feel festive. Whether at a family gathering or a quiet afternoon, they're the kind of food that brings everyone together. Seriously good. Giving you a taste of real Ligurian heritage every time you enjoy these golden, crunchy bites. And look, the warm memories of baking and sharing these cookies become a cherished part of the Easter season. They capture the spirit of togetherness and tradition, no question.
To prepare the Lenten cookies, start with the preparation of the dough. Take a mixer and add the almond flour and sugar . Turn on the mixer and blend the ingredients well. Once the ingredients are fully blended and mixed, place these ingredients in a bowl . At this point, add an egg white and knead your mixture vigorously with your hands.
At this point, sprinkle a work surface with powdered sugar and pour the blended almond flour and sugar over it . Knead the dough vigorously with your hands . Once the ingredients are fully mixed, shape the dough into a sphere. Now, with the help of a rolling pin, roll out the dough until it's about 5/16 inch thick .
Then proceed with the preparation of the tartlets. Using a cookie cutter with a diameter of 4 inches, cut circles from the dough to obtain your shapes of marzipan. You should get 6 shapes. With the dough obtained, fill your 6 tartlets , making sure the dough adheres well to the edges. Then proceed with the preparation of the shortbread cookies. Using the same dough, cut it with a 1 3/4 inch diameter round cookie cutter . Repeat the operation 4 times to get the discs that will become the base of your shortbread cookies.
Next, take the shortbread cookies and, with a smaller 3/4 inch cookie cutter, cut out an inner circle (the inner part of the shortbread can be kneaded again for the preparation of the mustaccioli) . Now place the tartlets and the shortbread cookies covered with marzipan on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . With the remaining dough, proceed to prepare the Lenten mustaccioli. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch thick and cut 2 1/2 inch diamond shapes using a diamond-shaped cutter or a paper template .
Then take the mustaccioli, lightly press in the center of the diamond , and place a bit of fig jam inside, covering it with another piece of marzipan in the shape of a diamond to keep the jam well enclosed between the two pieces of dough . A small trick: slightly trim the edges of your two enclosed diamonds to ensure the two overlapping parts adhere well .
Then place the filled mustaccioli on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Bake your baking sheet with the tartlets, shortbread cookies, and Lenten mustaccioli in a preheated static oven at 320°F for 15 minutes. Then take them out and place them on a rack to cool, so they firm up while cooling and keep their desired shape . While the Lenten cookies cool, proceed to prepare the fondant sugar (for more detail on preparing fondant sugar, click Fondant Sugar ). Start by taking a small saucepan. Melt the granulated sugar and water in it .
Then add the glucose . Heat on low and, with a hand whisk, keep stirring the ingredients to mix them well, avoiding lump formation . Bring your mixture to a temperature of 239°F (to check the sugar's temperature, you need a sugar thermometer) .
When the sugar reaches this temperature, transfer it to a bowl and keep stirring with a spoon until the mixture reaches 140°F. Once this temperature is reached, move the mixture to a stand mixer with a leaf attachment. Keep working it until you get a white, compact paste. At this point, divide the white fondant sugar paste into 3 parts. Take one part of the fondant sugar and heat it in a bain-marie (make sure it does not exceed 140°F) . Flavor the melted fondant sugar paste with orange blossom .
Then proceed by adding the food coloring and mix well to make the color uniform . Immediately fill the tartlets to prevent the fondant sugar from drying and not absorbing the colors .
Then continue by repeating the operation, coloring the other two portions of fondant sugar with pink and yellow colors. Fill the tartlets with the pink and yellow fondant sugar . At this point, take a brush and brush the glucose on your Lenten cookies that are not filled with fondant (the shortbread cookies and mustaccioli) and add sugar pearls to decorate as desired. Here are your delicious Lenten cookies ready to be enjoyed !
Lenten cookies can be stored in a tin for 1 week.
If you don't have glucose at home, you can replace it with honey to brush your Lenten cookies, which you can then decorate with sugar pearls.
