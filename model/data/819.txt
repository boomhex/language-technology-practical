instructions:
To make the fried spring chicken, take the whole chicken, place it on the cutting board with the breast facing up, and cut along both sides of the central bone , then give it a few taps to break the bone. Open the chicken and remove the bone . Turn it over and lightly press it with your hands .
Now prepare the batter: in a bowl, pour the flour and water , mix with a whisk until a well-blended mixture is obtained .


Dip the chicken in it and move it well so that the batter completely covers it . Then pass it through the breadcrumbs , which you have previously poured onto a plate, making sure not to leave any part uncovered.
Put the chicken on a clean plate and leave it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes; this step will help the breading adhere better. Meanwhile, heat the oil until it reaches 340°F (the perfect temperature for frying). After the necessary time, immerse the chicken in the oil and let it fry for about 5 minutes on one side without moving it, then turn it and let it fry until it is completely golden and crispy.
Drain it with a slotted spoon and place it on a tray lined with paper towels . Salt to taste and serve the fried spring chicken piping hot .
The fried spring chicken can be stored in the fridge for 2 days when closed, but it is recommended to consume it immediately to preserve its crispiness.
You can substitute rice flour with all-purpose flour.
