The pan-seared rabbit is a rustic and flavorful second course, perfect for bringing a classic homemade dish to the table with just a few simple steps. The rabbit is browned over high heat until it gets a crispy golden crust, then deglazed with white wine to enhance its flavor. The result is a succulent dish, enveloped in a rich and fragrant cooking base that makes every bite irresistible. Thanks to slow cooking, the meat remains tender and juicy. You can serve the pan-seared rabbit during a family lunch or a dinner with friends, to rediscover the pleasure of traditional recipes that won't keep you in the kitchen for too long.

To prepare the pan-seared rabbit, first pour the oil into a non-stick pan, place the rabbit pieces inside, and add the garlic in its skin . Sear over high heat for a few minutes on both sides of the meat, then deglaze with white wine and let all the alcohol evaporate .
Season with salt and pepper , then add a few sage leaves and some rosemary sprigs . Cover with a lid and cook over low heat for 30 minutes.
When the meat is cooked, remove the lid, add half a glass of water, and continue cooking for another 10 minutes, or until a sufficiently thick cooking base forms . Plate and add a generous spoonful of the cooking base over the meat . The pan-seared rabbit is ready to be served .
The pan-seared rabbit can be stored in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for 1-2 days. Before serving it again, heat it in a pan over low heat, adding a little water or broth to keep the meat tender.
For a more intense flavor, you can replace white wine with red wine. For a more substantial dish, you can add diced potatoes during the last 20 minutes of cooking, or sauté porcini or champignon mushrooms separately and add them to the meat in the last minutes of cooking. In addition to rosemary and sage, you can add other herbs such as thyme, bay leaf, or marjoram.
