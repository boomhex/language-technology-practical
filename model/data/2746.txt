These chocolate hazelnut cookies ? You find them everywhere in Italy. I mean, there's something really special—truly unique—about how they mix a tender cocoa shortcrust with a splash of jam. Picture this: a little bite of moist cocoa dough with a crispy edge, and then bam! A spoonful of berry jam right in the center. That's the magic of these cocoa hazelnut biscuits . And look, it's all about mixing carefully. You wanna keep that dough cool and soft so it just melts in your mouth. Italians really care about their pastry. For real. Overworking the frolla by hand? Not a great idea. It heats up and makes it tough to roll.
The pairing of hazelnuts and cocoa is classic. Plus, that jam in the middle? It just pops with a sweet and tangy flavor that makes everything, well, better. Heart-shaped and round cookie cutters give these jam-filled cookies a cute twist, which is probably why they're so popular for Valentine's Day. Or even just a special breakfast.
People all over Italy use their favorite jams. Sometimes raspberry, other times blackcurrant or mixed berries—it really depends on what's available. These cookies kinda remind folks of Italian sandwich cookies or maybe Linzer cookies, but with that Italian flair of hazelnuts and cocoa. They're perfect for gifts or just something special for breakfast. You know, when you wanna add a bit of golden sweetness to the table.
The whole process? It’s about patience, pretty simple steps, and top-notch ingredients—right at the heart of traditional Italian desserts. Whether you're craving chocolate and jam cookies or hunting for new hazelnut spread recipes , these cookies really hit the spot. Honestly, each bite offers a soft, tender center, a crispy crunch, and a burst of fruity jam—a mix that's super hard to beat. Can't go wrong with that.
To prepare the cocoa and hazelnut cookies with jam, start with the cocoa and hazelnut shortcrust pastry: place the sifted flour , cold butter from the fridge , and hazelnut flour in a mixer.
Operate the blades to achieve a sandy texture , then transfer the mixture to a work surface and create the classic well. In the center, place the egg . Then cut a vanilla pod and scrape out the seeds with the blade of a knife .
Add them to the center of the well along with the sifted powdered sugar and hazelnut paste . Quickly combine everything with your hands just until the dough comes together. Then add the sifted unsweetened cocoa powder ;
handle the mixture to incorporate the cocoa and form a dough: flatten it slightly and wrap it with plastic wrap . Place the dough in the refrigerator to firm up for at least an hour; after the necessary time, roll out the dough into a sheet about a quarter-inch thick .
Using a 2-inch diameter cookie cutter, cut out 20 discs , then on half of them, use heart-shaped cutters with a 1-inch diameter to cut out hearts (the hearts you extract can be baked together with the other cookies) .
Place the shapes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper (16-17) and bake them in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 10 minutes (if using a fan oven, 320°F for about 5 minutes). Once baked, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack .
Then, spread raspberry jam on the discs and close with the heart halves . Your cocoa and hazelnut cookies with jam are ready !
You can store the cocoa and hazelnut cookies with jam under a glass dome or in a tin box for 1-2 days. The cocoa and hazelnut shortcrust can be frozen for about a month wrapped in plastic wrap and thawed in the refrigerator as needed.
