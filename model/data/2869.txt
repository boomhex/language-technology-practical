Zucchini bread, huh? It might seem a bit surprising at first, but it's actually one of those American classics that keeps popping up at bake sales and family gatherings. Why? Because it's just so, so good. This zucchini bread is moist, a little sweet, and smells amazing when it comes out of the oven. People often make it for special occasions like Thanksgiving, but really, it works great as a snack with coffee or even for breakfast.
The magic? The trick is squeezing out the extra water from the zucchini before mixing it in—really key. That’s what gives it that perfect crumb and keeps it from turning soggy. And the glaze? People sometimes finish it with a light water glaze on top—looks inviting and adds a touch of tangy flavor. The loaf? It’s not just tasty; it looks really nice on the table too.
Not everyone expects veggies in their cake, but hey, that’s part of the fun with this easy zucchini bread recipe . Once you try a slice, it’s clear why it gets passed around at family potlucks. The moist zucchini bread is tender enough to break apart with your hands. The zucchini blends right in, giving it some color but not making it taste like a vegetable at all. And here's the thing, it’s a great way to use up extra zucchini if you have a bunch lying around in the summer.
And look, people like to change things up—some add nuts or even chocolate chips, but the basic version is hard to beat. Seriously good. It’s the kind of homemade zucchini bread that tastes even better the next day, staying soft and golden. Whether it’s for a special day or just because you’re in the mood for something different, this classic zucchini bread has a way of making any day feel a little cozier and a lot more delicious. Pretty simple, really. It's a versatile treat that brings warmth and comfort with every bite. For sure.
To prepare the zucchini bread, start with the zucchinis: wash them and trim the ends. Then grate them and place them in a strainer to drain the moisture . To help release the liquid, you can press down with the back of a spoon .
Leave the zucchinis in the strainer, then move on to the batter: in the bowl of a stand mixer (you can also use an electric mixer), pour in the eggs and sugar , then start whisking to combine the ingredients .
You should get a smooth and homogeneous cream , pour it into a bowl and set it aside for a moment. Meanwhile, in another small bowl, sift the flour .
Add the almond flour , the baking powder , and the salt, sifting them as well, then grate the nutmeg .
Add the dry ingredients to the egg and sugar mixture , mix with a wooden spoon, then pour in the vegetable oil and mix again, then also add the vanilla extract .
Also add the previously grated and drained zucchinis . Mix the ingredients well , then grease a loaf pan of dimensions 12x4.5 inches using a pastry brush .
Dust it thoroughly with flour and pour in the mixture , leveling it with a spatula or the back of a spoon to fill the pan evenly . Then bake the zucchini bread in a preheated static oven for 50-60 minutes at 350°F (if using a convection oven, 340°F for 30-40 minutes).
Before removing it from the oven, do the toothpick test: insert it into the batter, and if it comes out clean, the cake is ready: take it out of the oven and let it cool , then unmold it and drizzle with the help of a spoon the Water Glaze over the surface of the cake, which is simple to make as follows: gather 125 g of sifted powdered sugar in a small bowl, and add 2 tablespoons of boiling water to the sugar, one spoonful at a time, stirring to dissolve the sugar. The consistency should be fluid and sticky: if the glaze turns out too runny, add more powdered sugar, one tablespoon at a time; conversely, if it is too thick, add a few drops of water. Decorate the zucchini bread with the water glaze before serving it !
Store the zucchini bread under a glass dome for no more than 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can enrich the batter with chopped hazelnuts or walnuts, or with chocolate chips. You can sprinkle the zucchini bread with just powdered sugar if you prefer.
