Gradually add the sifted flour and baking powder , continuously working the mixture with the whisk. Once the dry ingredients are absorbed, also add the melted and slightly cooled butter . When it's absorbed, finally pour in the room temperature milk and continue mixing.
Pour the mixture into a 9-inch Bundt pan . Bake the dessert in a preheated static oven at 340°F for about 50 minutes. Before removing from the oven, check that the dessert is cooked with the toothpick test: if it comes out dry, the dessert is ready. Let the quick and easy dessert cool slightly, then turn it out onto a rack to cool completely, and finish your quick and easy dessert recipe with a dusting of powdered sugar .
You can store the quick and easy dessert under a glass dome for up to 3-4 days.
It can be frozen once cooked and completely cooled.
If you use a stand mixer equipped with beaters, you can first mix the butter cut into pieces with the sugar, then proceed with the aromas, eggs, flour, and baking powder, and finally the milk.
To make the quick and easy dessert even more delicious, you can enrich it with chocolate chips in the batter.
