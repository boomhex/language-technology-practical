Easy, quick, and versatile, scaloppine are great with everything! Whether they are lemon flavored or with mushrooms , made with veal or pork, they are loved by everyone because they are tender and creamy. With the beer scaloppine recipe, we offer you one more tantalizing idea! Instead of white wine or Marsala Escalopes , this time we have deglazed the beef slices with beer, which will provide a rich and enveloping aroma. A simple and tasty main course of meat to accompany with a side of vegetables or roasted potatoes, and voilà... with beer scaloppine, dinner is ready to be served!
To prepare beer scaloppine, first pound the meat slices with a meat tenderizer to reduce their thickness . In a pan, melt the butter with the oil and add the thyme sprigs .
Flour the meat on both sides and lay it in the pan . Cook for 3-4 minutes over medium-high heat, then turn the slices over .
At this point, pour in the beer and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until the sauce has thickened. Salt , pepper, and serve your beer scaloppine hot !
It is recommended to consume the beer scaloppine immediately. Alternatively, you can store them in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
If you prefer, you can use veal or chicken instead of beef.
Changing the type of beer will give a slightly different aroma each time!
