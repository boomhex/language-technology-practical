instructions:
To prepare the peppers with an air fryer, first wash them, dry them, and place them in the air fryer basket. Cook for 30 minutes at 392°F, turning them halfway through . They should be well-golden on all sides . After cooking, let the peppers cool inside the turned-off air fryer for about 30 minutes. This way, steam will form inside the chamber, and the peppers will peel easily.
Once cooled, remove the peppers from the basket and peel off the outer skin gently with your hands . Remove the stem .
Also remove the seeds and internal filaments by scraping them with the back of a knife . Cut them into strips and arrange them on a serving plate .
Season the peppers with salt , oregano , and basil leaves torn with your hands .
Add the peeled and sliced garlic clove , the oil , and mix. You can serve the peppers immediately or store them in the refrigerator to cool.
Store the peppers in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
If you prefer, you can also freeze the peeled, unseasoned peppers.
For preparing the peppers, we used a 7-liter air fryer. If yours is smaller, cook fewer peppers at a time.
You can cut the peppers into slices and use them to make pepper rolls.
Alternatively, once the peppers are cut into strips, place them in a small baking pan and top with: breadcrumbs, grated cheese, a handful of capers and olives, and gratinate for 8 minutes at 392°F in the air fryer.
