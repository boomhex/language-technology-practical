instructions:
To prepare sticky potatoes, first wash them under water, then peel them . Next, cut the potatoes into fairly thin round slices, about 1/8 inch . You can slice them with a knife or a mandolin.
At this point, take a high non-stick pan that's not too wide (in this case, the more the potatoes are piled and overlapped, the better!) and pour in plenty of oil . The amount of oil should be enough to fully cover the bottom of the pan, reaching about 1/2 inch in height. An important consideration is that the potatoes should not be completely immersed in the oil, as with fried ones. Heat the oil in the pan, then add all the potatoes and season with salt . Cook over high heat.
After a few minutes, shake the pan, then with the help of a spoon, gently turn the potatoes over . To avoid breaking the potatoes too much, it's important not to stir too often, but rather every few minutes. Cook for about 25 minutes until the potatoes are cooked . Then drain them from excess oil and serve .
We recommend consuming sticky potatoes immediately; alternatively, you can store them in the fridge for 1-2 days and reheat them before serving.
If you can't find Sila potatoes, you can use yellow-fleshed potatoes. Sticky potatoes can be enriched with mushrooms, bacon, or Tropea onions.
