Shrimp ravioli —seriously good—is a total star on Italian coastal tables. And here's the thing, it's perfect when you're craving something special. Like, really special and fresh. The filling has this creamy texture thanks to ricotta and chopped shrimp. But the real kicker? The zesty hit of lemon and a sprinkle of thyme. In places like Liguria or the Amalfi Coast, seafood is the way to go, so making shrimp ravioli with these flavors is a no-brainer.
There's a cool tradition here: making a shrimp broth—fumetto—by simmering the shells. I mean, it makes sure nothing goes to waste while boosting that seafood flavor. Wrapped in fresh egg dough, each bite? Pretty amazing. It's a mix of tender pasta, seafood and that hint of bright citrus.
And you know what? Serving lemon ravioli with a simple butter and thyme sauce is classic Italy. For sure. The melted butter gives off a light, nutty aroma, while thyme adds a fresh, almost herby taste that just clicks with seafood. The sauce clings just right. Perfectly moist, not heavy at all. This dish? A favorite for special dinners. It's impressive but not too much. Compared to lobster or crab ravioli, this one's way way more delicate—thanks to the lemon and shrimp combo.
Along the coast, you'll find all sorts of variations. Some add more citrus, maybe a splash of white wine. But the heart? It's always about those fresh sea flavors. Homemade seafood pasta like this is a real showstopper—makes you feel like you've brought a slice of the Italian coast right to your table. Each bite offers a mix of golden pasta, rich shrimp, and that clean, bright lemony finish. For real. It is like being whisked away to a sunny coastal day in Italy.

To make shrimp and lemon ravioli with butter and thyme, first clean the shrimp: remove the head and shell and set them aside , then cut the back and gently extract the black filament. Finally, roughly chop the flesh and set it aside; you will need about 9 oz of flesh and 16 oz of scraps.
Clean the leek by removing the end and the greener leaves, then cut it into thin slices . Proceed to prepare the stock: melt the butter in a saucepan , then add the leek and let it flavor.
Add the shellfish scraps and brown for a couple of minutes over high heat , then deglaze with the white wine .
Now pour the water to completely cover the shellfish , add the parsley, pepper, and moderately salt since the stock is already quite savory . Lower the heat and simmer for at least 60 minutes, removing the impurities that rise to the surface with a skimmer .
Meanwhile, prepare the fresh pasta: in a bowl, pour the flour and the slightly beaten eggs . Start mixing with a fork , then work the dough with your hands .
When you have obtained a homogeneous consistency , transfer the dough onto the work surface and continue kneading for about 5 minutes until you form a uniform dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature . Meanwhile, you can prepare the filling: in a bowl, work the ricotta with salt and pepper, then flavor with thyme leaves .
Add the grated lemon zest and the chopped raw shrimp . Mix well to combine everything , then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator until the pasta's resting time is over.
After the resting time, slightly flatten the dough with your fingers on the floured work surface , then roll it out with a pasta machine reducing the thickness little by little : you will need to obtain 2 rectangular sheets about 1/16 inch thick .
Distribute filling piles weighing about 1 oz on one of the sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Brush the edges around the filling with a little water , then cover with the second sheet and press with your fingertips to seal and remove the air that would cause the filling to leak during cooking . Cut the ravioli with a 2¾ inch diameter round cutter .
Place the obtained ravioli on a slightly floured cloth . At this point, the stock will be ready, so strain it with a fine-mesh sieve : it should be reduced to about half of the initial liquid .
You are ready to cook: while bringing the stock to a boil in a pot, melt the butter in a pan with the thyme leaves , then add salt, pepper, and a ladleful of stock . Cook the ravioli in the stock for 4-5 minutes .
Once cooked, transfer them with a slotted spoon to the pan with the seasoning and briefly toss them . Scent with grated lemon zest and serve your shrimp and lemon ravioli with butter and thyme !
Once the ravioli are prepared, we recommend cooking them immediately, and once cooked, it is best to consume them immediately; alternatively, you can store leftover ravioli in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.
If you prefer, you can store the shrimp ravioli in the freezer for up to 1 month. You can proceed as follows: place the tray with the ravioli in the freezer for a couple of hours or until they are hardened, then place them in food-grade freezer bags. When you want to use them, remove the freezer bag from the freezer and cook them still frozen by dropping them directly into the boiling water or stock.
As an alternative to thyme, you can flavor your shrimp and lemon ravioli with parsley or rosemary.
