instructions:
To prepare pasta potatoes and eggs, start by placing a pot filled with salted water on the stove . While the water boils, peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes about 0.39 inches (1 cm) .
Add the potatoes to the water and cook for about 10 minutes; check that the potatoes are done by piercing them with a fork. Meanwhile, in a pan, add a drizzle of oil and the garlic clove , allow the oil to infuse at moderate heat, then drain the potatoes with a slotted spoon into the pan .
Season with thyme leaves and a sprinkle of black pepper. Pour a ladle of cooking water and continue to cook the potatoes. When the potatoes are very soft, remove the garlic
and mash the potatoes with a wooden spoon or a fork . In the pot where you cooked the potatoes, cook the pasta for 7-8 minutes . Meanwhile, in a bowl, pour the yolks, the Pecorino
and the pepper; mix everything and set aside . After the pasta's cooking time, drain it al dente into the pan with the potato cream , finish cooking by adding a ladle of pasta cooking water .
Remove the pan from the heat, pour the mixture of yolks and cheese , based on the consistency of the sauce, add more pasta cooking water as needed. Stir to blend everything with the heat off. Finally, add a sprinkle of pepper. Serve the pasta potatoes and eggs immediately .
We recommend consuming the pasta potatoes and eggs immediately.
With the remaining egg whites, you can make some French meringue (basic dough) or our delicious Egg White and Cocoa Cake !
