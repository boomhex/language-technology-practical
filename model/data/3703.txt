To prepare the ham and arugula swirls, start with the filling. In a bowl, place the robiola cheese, coarsely chopped ham, salt, and pepper . Lastly, add the milk and begin to blend the ingredients with an immersion blender .
You should obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream . Now take a slice of bread and lightly flatten it with a rolling pin , then spread a layer of ham cream over the entire surface .
Take the well-washed and dried arugula and distribute it over the slice of bread so as to cover the entire layer of cream , then begin to roll the bread onto itself starting from the short side . You will get cylindrical rolls weighing about 2.5 oz each.
Individually wrap the rolls in plastic wrap , place them on a tray or dish, and let them rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. After the necessary time, gently remove the plastic wrap and cut them into slices about 0.4 inches thick . The ham and arugula swirls are ready .
Ideally, the swirls should be consumed freshly made, but if desired, they can be stored for 2-3 days in the refrigerator, sealed in an airtight container.
For a crunchy note, you can add a sprinkle of coarsely chopped walnuts to the ham cream and fill the swirls with your favorite ingredients. A delicious suggestion for your children? Make sweet swirls by spreading chocolate cream on sandwich bread!
