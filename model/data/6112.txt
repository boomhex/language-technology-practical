To make the crispy onion, peel and cut the red onions into slices about 7 mm thick , then further divide each slice in half to obtain strips .
Flour the onion slices and remove the excess flour. Heat the seed oil and dip a handful of onions at a time into the boiling oil . Fry the onions, turning them often with a slotted spoon until they change color .
Once browned evenly, drain and transfer them to absorbent paper . Let it cool completely and sprinkle with coarse salt . Your crispy onion is ready to be enjoyed!

To ensure a nice crispy consistency wait for the onions to turn golden before draining and leave them uncovered during the cooling phase.
