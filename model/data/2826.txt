instructions:
To prepare the pork medallion with Roquefort, start by cutting the loin into 4 fillets of about 7 oz each . Then wrap them with a slice of pancetta , press 2 sage leaves onto the sides of the fillet and cover with another slice of pancetta .
At this point, tie the fillets with kitchen twine to help them hold their shape during cooking . Now that the meat is ready, prepare the pan for cooking: pour a drizzle of oil and add the butter to melt it over low heat.
Place the pork fillets in the pan and cook them over medium heat for about 4 to 6 minutes per side, depending on your preferred doneness (it's better not to cook them too long to avoid the meat becoming tough); during cooking, turn them to the other side as well . Meanwhile, cut the Roquefort cheese into pieces .
Once the medallions are ready, set them aside and in the same pan where you cooked them, pour in the cream and add the Roquefort ; let it melt over medium heat, salt to taste , and stir occasionally with a wooden spoon.
When the sauce has thickened , turn off the heat, dress the pork medallions with some sauce (14-15), and pour the remaining sauce into a sauceboat to serve it separately to your guests!
It's best to consume the pork medallions right after cooking. The sauce can be stored in the fridge covered with plastic wrap for 1-2 days.
Roquefort is the king of French cheeses, but if you can't find it, you can use Gorgonzola, which is very similar in appearance and taste!
