instructions:
To prepare the amaranth muffins, start by pouring the amaranth into a non-stick pan to toast it . At this point, the amaranth will start to pop like popcorn, so put the lid on and leave it on the heat for about 3-4 minutes over low heat, then let it cool .
Mix the amaranth flour with the all-purpose flour and baking powder, then sift them into a large bowl . Add the whole wheat flour , brown sugar , and salt.
In another small bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk and add the rice milk and oil . Then pour this mixture into the bowl with the flours .
Mix well with a spatula and add the chocolate chips . Also add the grated orange zest and the previously toasted and now cooled amaranth, keeping about 5 grams aside to decorate your muffins .
Pour the batter into a piping bag and use it to fill the muffin cups, being careful not to exceed 3/4 of the mold . Sprinkle the surface with chocolate chips and toasted amaranth and bake at 356°F in a static oven for 20 minutes (if using a convection oven, bake at 320°F for 15 minutes) . Let cool slightly and serve your amaranth muffins.
You can store your amaranth muffins in the refrigerator for up to 2 or 3 days. If you like, you can also freeze them after baking and thaw them when needed.
Instead of chocolate chips, you can use raisins after rinsing and soaking them in cold water. Instead of orange zest, you might choose to use vanilla to flavor your muffins.
You can find amaranth and amaranth flour in organic stores, well-stocked supermarkets, or online!
