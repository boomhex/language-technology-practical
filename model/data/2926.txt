To prepare the pumpkin cabbage rolls, start with the pumpkin. Cut the pumpkin into slices about 3/4 inch thick , remove the seeds and stringy part , and peel the skin .
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the pumpkin slices on it; drizzle them with a little oil, add a few sprigs of rosemary, and salt and pepper to taste . Bake the pumpkin in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 25-30 minutes, until it softens. While the pumpkin is baking, take the savoy cabbage, remove the core , then peel it and take 5 large leaves weighing 2 oz each .
Remove the central part of the leaves, which is the hardest , and divide them in half . Blanch the cabbage leaves for about 1 minute in boiling salted water .
Then drain them with a slotted spoon and place them on a strainer . Trim the cabbage leaves to create a rather regular rectangle . Now move on to the bacon: cut it into strips and then into cubes about 1/5 inch .
Then drizzle a small pan with a little oil and add the bacon cubes to sauté for about 5-10 minutes . When the fatty part has slightly melted and the bacon has colored, turn off the heat . Meanwhile, take the pumpkin out of the oven, which will have softened and flavored .
Let it cool for a moment, then cut the pumpkin slices into pieces and put them in the mixer . Turn on the blades to reduce the slices to pulp . Then transfer the obtained pulp into a piping bag using a spatula .
Now you can start composing your rolls: put a little pumpkin pulp in the center of each cabbage leaf , then add a teaspoon of bacon cubes and fold it into a packet like this: fold the longer sides of the leaves towards the center ,
Fold the two ends inward and turn the rolls over to the other side so that the side with the pumpkin is visible . Butter a baking dish using a kitchen brush ,
Then start arranging the rolls in the baking dish . Sprinkle them with grated Grana Padano cheese and bake them in grill mode at 430°F for 5-10 minutes. Then take them out of the oven and enjoy the pumpkin cabbage rolls hot or warm!
Pumpkin cabbage rolls are excellent when freshly made. They can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. They can be frozen before being baked, only if fresh, non-defrosted ingredients have been used. In this case, they can be thawed in the refrigerator and put in the oven at 350°F for about 10 minutes.
What's missing, do you think? Missing a spicy touch? Just a sprinkle of nutmeg or sweet paprika will do. Missing a crunchy note? Why not crumble some amaretti into the filling just before closing the rolls? Missing the classic salami flavor? Well, replace the bacon with pancetta, cooked ham, or sausage. If, instead, the recipe is more about missing cabbage in your fridge, know that you can also use lettuce leaves without any problem.
