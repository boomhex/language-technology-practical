instructions:
To prepare Roman-style baked gnocchi, start by pouring the milk into a pot, add the butter , salt, pepper , and season with nutmeg .
Bring to a boil and add the semolina gradually , stirring vigorously with a whisk to avoid lumps. Cook on low heat for a few minutes until it thickens . When the mixture begins to pull away from the bottom of the pot, remove it from the heat, add the egg yolks , and mix.
Also add the grated Parmesan cheese in several batches , stirring to incorporate it. Transfer the mixture onto a sheet of parchment paper , cover with another sheet of parchment paper, and roll out with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 3/8 inch . Let it cool completely.
Meanwhile, prepare the béchamel: in a saucepan, add the butter, salt, pepper , and let it melt over low heat. Add the flour all at once and stir vigorously to prevent lumps. Once you have the roux, gradually add the milk you've heated separately, stirring continuously .
Stir over low heat for 5-6 minutes until reaching the desired consistency . Set the béchamel aside and chop the cooked ham into pieces . Take the semolina mixture and cut out discs using a 2-inch diameter round cutter .
Butter 2 baking dishes with a diameter of 8 inches and sprinkle the bottom with grated Parmesan cheese . Arrange the gnocchi in a circular pattern, slightly overlapping them, starting from the outer edge and working towards the center .
Cover the gnocchi with béchamel , then distribute the cooked ham and finish with more grated Parmesan cheese .
Add a few knobs of butter and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 20-25 minutes . Your Roman-style baked gnocchi is ready to be served !
Roman-style baked gnocchi can be stored in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in a closed container, for 1-2 days. Before serving, reheat in the oven at 356°F for about 10 minutes, adding a splash of milk or a few knobs of butter to maintain creaminess.
You can freeze them before or after baking.
In addition to Parmesan, you can add pecorino for a more robust flavor, or smoked scamorza pieces for a bit of stringiness.
For a more rustic variant, substitute cooked ham with crispy speck or sautéed bacon.
