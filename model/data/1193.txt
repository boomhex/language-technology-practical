instructions:
To prepare baked ziti with lamb sauce, start with the béchamel. In a saucepan, heat the milk until almost boiling . Meanwhile, in another saucepan, melt the butter and then add the flour all at once , stirring immediately with a wooden spoon. This will form the roux, let it brown for a minute .
Remove the roux from the heat momentarily and gradually add the milk to avoid lumps . As soon as the mixture is smooth, return to the heat and continue stirring until cooked through . Transfer the sauce to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap .
In the meantime, prepare the sauce. Cut the lamb into small pieces . Heat a pan with oil and garlic, once the base is hot, add the lamb pieces . When the meat is well browned, add the tomato sauce and simmer on low heat for 30 minutes .
When the sauce is ready, cook the ziti in boiling salted water . Pour the béchamel into the sauce and season with salt .
When the ziti are al dente, drain and dress them immediately . Transfer to a baking dish and sprinkle the surface with grated Grana Padano cheese . Bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for about 20 minutes . Once ready, enjoy your baked ziti with lamb sauce hot.
