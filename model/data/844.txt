instructions:
To prepare risotto alla Norma, first make the Vegetable broth and keep it warm. Then take care of the eggplants: wash them and trim them . First slice them and then dice them into about 3/8 inch cubes .
In a non-stick pan, heat 2 tbsps of oil, add a peeled garlic clove and a few basil leaves . Add the eggplants inside , season with salt, and mix .
Cook for about 10 minutes on high heat, when they are well browned, transfer them to a dish with some paper towels , remove the garlic and set aside. Now start cooking the rice, in a wide pot with high sides, heat a drizzle of oil and add the rice .
Add a pinch of salt , in this way each grain will be well seasoned. Toast the rice over medium-high heat, stirring often for about 3 minutes. After toasting, add all the tomato sauce . Be careful as it might splatter. Stir often to prevent the rice from sticking and adjust the heat so that the boil is not too intense. After 5 minutes, add half of the hot vegetable broth .
Meanwhile, grate the salted ricotta and Parmesan, always keeping an eye on the rice and stirring it often. Halfway through cooking, pour in the remaining broth . Once the rice is cooked, adjust the salt if necessary, turn off the heat, and finish it. Add the Parmesan .
Add half of the salted ricotta , the oil, some basil leaves , and half of the eggplants .
Mix well to blend all the flavors . Transfer the rice to serving plates, add the remaining eggplants , salted ricotta, and more basil leaves . Serve your risotto alla Norma immediately!
Risotto alla Norma can be stored for 2 days in the refrigerator. Just heat it with a little water or broth before serving!
Risotto alla Norma is also great for making arancini, timbales, or supplì.
Be very careful when pouring the sauce as it tends to splatter a lot and during cooking because the rice tends to stick a lot. If preferred, you can add more broth, but it will result in a lighter flavor and a paler color. This technique is for a risotto with a strong tomato color and flavor.
