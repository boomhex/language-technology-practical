instructions:
Cardoon parmigiana is one of those Italian cardoon dishes that really brings something different to the table. I mean, instead of eggplant, you get this tender, slightly earthy cardoon. It's kinda like celery, but really more like artichoke. In Umbria—especially around Perugia—cardoons have been a staple forever. And listen, they’re often mixed with a rich meat sauce in dishes like cardoon gratin or 'gobbi alla perugina.' This dish has a deep sense of history and shows up in regions like Lazio and Marche too. Cardoon is kinda special, almost old-school. Some say it's got medicinal qualities—makes a plate of this hearty food feel unique. The flavors get deep and golden as it bakes, which is great, making it feel homey and adventurous all at once.
Many folks know the classic eggplant parmigiana, but switching to cardoon parmesan really really changes things up. The way the cardoons soak up the sauce and cheese—so so good—gives the casserole a moist, savory bite that's different from what you might expect. There’s this comforting vibe in these layered, oven-baked cardoon recipes , especially since they celebrate seasonal ingredients. In Umbria, cooking big trays of cardoon au gratin is a winter thing—when cardoons are at their peak. The result? A bubbling, cheesy meal that tops any comfort food list. Trying this baked cardoon version offers a taste of real central Italian cooking. For sure. If you’re looking to explore beyond typical dishes, you’ll find it’s a little crispy on top, soft inside, and packed with flavor—a true example of how Italian home cooks turn simple ingredients into something special. This dish not only gives you a taste of regional tradition but also highlights the beauty of using locally sourced produce, making each bite a journey into the heart of Italy's culinary heritage. So here's the deal, it is seriously good.
To prepare the cardoon parmigiana, start by cooking the tomato sauce with meat. So clean and finely chop celery, carrot, and onion with a knife, and sauté all in a pot where you have poured some extra virgin olive oil . Then add the ground veal and pork and sear for a few minutes, then add the tomato pulp .
Adjust with salt and pepper and let everything cook for 30 minutes over medium heat. The sauce will be ready once you have reached your preferred consistency . In the meantime, proceed with cleaning the cardoons. Remove the outermost stalks, which are very tough and bitter .
Reach the more tender and flavorful inner stalks, then remove the strings with the help of a vegetable peeler and cut into pieces of 2.5-3 inches, making the cooking uniform . Immediately immerse the cardoon pieces in cold acidulated water , where you have squeezed the juice of one lemon, to prevent them from browning.
Drain the cardoons and boil them for 2 minutes in salted boiling water then let them drain well so they also have time to cool down . Beat the eggs in a small bowl with a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper ,
flour the cardoon pieces and then dip them in the eggs . Fry them, a few at a time, in a pot with hot seed oil (check with a kitchen thermometer that it does not exceed 340-355°F) for about 4-5 minutes, or until a golden crust forms on the surface .
As you cook them, drain them on absorbent paper to soak up the excess oil . Sprinkle the bottom of a 12x8 inch baking dish with some sauce , spreading evenly, and then lay the fried cardoons side by side .
After forming the first layer, add a little more sauce and sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and continue in this way, alternating layers of cardoons with sauce and cheese until the ingredients are finished.
On the last layer of your parmigiana, sprinkle with the remaining grated Parmesan cheese and bake in a preheated oven at 355°F for 25 minutes in static mode (in a fan oven, bake at 320°F for 15 minutes). To get a crust on the surface, bake for another 5 minutes in grill mode. Wait 5 minutes , necessary for everything to settle, and then serve your cardoon parmigiana hot !
Cardoon parmigiana can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, keeping it well wrapped in plastic wrap. It can also be frozen if you used only very fresh and not previously frozen ingredients.
An equally delicious version of cardoon parmigiana is the white one! To make it, simply replace the tomato sauce with béchamel and use slices of cooked ham between layers. You can make your tomato sauce more fragrant by adding basil at the end of cooking or using a pinch of fresh chili to add to the sauté.
