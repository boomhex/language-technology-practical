Trofie pasta with cod sauce is a classic dish from Liguria , Italy, perfect for when you want something special but without the hassle. Really, it's super easy. This Italian seafood pasta combines fresh trofie—those unique, twisty noodles native to Liguria—with a sauce made from canned cherry tomatoes, Taggiasca olives , and salty capers. These olives and capers—pretty essential in Ligurian cuisine —give the sauce that classic Mediterranean kick. And the flaky cod? It absorbs all those flavors, staying moist and tender.

And people really really love how the Italian seafood pasta blends the sweet taste of tomatoes with the punch from olives and capers, all tied together by the cod.

Whether you’re into homemade pasta dishes or just want to try something new, this one brings loads of flavor with simple ingredients.
