Chop the dark chocolate and add it to the ricotta along with the hazelnut grains .
Mix everything to blend all the ingredients well , then take one dough disc at a time ; place it on a cutting board and fill it with about 1 oz of the filling you prepared .
Fold the discs in half , pressing well with your fingers to create a half-moon shape ; seal the edges with the tines of a fork and continue in this way until all the ingredients are used.
Once finished , heat the frying oil in a large pan; when the oil has reached a temperature of 350°F-355°F (you can check with a kitchen thermometer), fry 2-3 panzerotti at a time until they become golden and crispy. Drain them with a slotted spoon and place them on paper towels, then you can serve and enjoy your panzerotti with ricotta, chocolate, and hazelnut grains .
