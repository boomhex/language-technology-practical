instructions:
To make candied ginger, first peel the ginger , then cut it into pieces about 0.8 inches ; you will obtain about 9 oz of ginger. Place the ginger in a saucepan, pour in enough water to cover it completely , and boil it for 30 minutes.
Once the ginger is boiled , you will have about 6 oz left. Drain it and place it back in a small pot, add the sugar
3.5 oz of water and the salt . Stir and cook for 20 minutes over medium heat. After the cooking time, part of the water will have evaporated, and bubbles will have formed on the surface ; turn off the heat and let the mixture cool.
Line a baking tray with parchment paper and sprinkle the surface with sugar . Pour the cooled ginger here , spread out the pieces, and sprinkle with more sugar .
Gather the ginger in a paper wrapping to help the sugar adhere better. Let it cool and then collect the candied ginger in a jar and enjoy it in small doses .
Candied ginger keeps for a week in airtight glass jars placed in a cool, dry place to prevent moisture from damaging it.
Do not throw away the water from the first boiling; it will be excellent to consume as a tea, taking care to dilute it in water, as the taste is quite intense.
