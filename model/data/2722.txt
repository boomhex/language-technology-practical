instructions:
Tartellette al pistacchio, ricotta e fragoline di bosco is an Italian dessert that feels super special, but you don't need to be a pastry chef to whip these up. I mean, these mini tarts? Really good stuff. The secret is in the tender pistachio shortcrust. It's packed with real pistachio granules and a hint of paste—really, a deeper nutty kick. In Sicily , top-quality pistachios are a must, and this pistachio tart is no exception, bursting with nutty richness.
And the filling? Creamy sheep ricotta with chocolate chips. For real, it makes every bite moist and just sweet enough without overdoing it. The game-changer? Those wild woodland strawberries—fragoline di bosco—perched on top. They add a burst of color and a tangy pop. Keeps it light, not too heavy. This combo is a big deal in Sicily. Really really unique mix of nuts, cheese, and fruit.
Honestly, you can skip the bakery. Make these at home for a party or whenever you wanna impress with a ricotta tart that's both pretty and delicious. Thing is, the textures are everything. You get the crispy bite of the shortcrust, silky smooth ricotta, and juicy, sweet strawberries. So elegant, yet pretty simple to make. No stress about fancy techniques.
Perfect for any get-together, especially if you're looking to serve something that screams Sicilian flavor. And look, even folks who usually pass on desserts go for these because the wild strawberry tart isn’t too rich or heavy. Plus, you can switch up the fruit on top if strawberries aren't in season, making this a super versatile pistachio dessert .
Whether you call it a pistachio and ricotta tart or a wild strawberry dessert , it's really what Sicily does best: mixing real ingredients for something traditional and impressive. Pretty much a crowd-pleaser.
To prepare the pistachio, ricotta, and wild strawberry tartlets, start with the pastry: in a mixer, pour the chopped pistachios (or use unsalted crushed pistachios), powdered sugar , and a pinch of salt; pulse the blades repeatedly to avoid overheating the nuts and chop everything . Then add the cold refrigerator butter cut into pieces and the flour;
create the crumble by pulsing the blades for a few moments . Pour the crumbly mixture into a bowl, add the pistachio paste and the egg .
start mixing the ingredients with a fork , then quickly knead with your hands and transfer the now more compact mixture to a work surface. Handle it just long enough to form a dough ball .
Then flatten it slightly and wrap it in plastic wrap ; then put it in the refrigerator for at least half an hour or until it is firm. In the meantime, focus on the filling: take the sheep ricotta (which you have drained overnight or at least 2 hours in a colander in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap), sift it to make it creamier , and then add the powdered sugar . Cover with cling film in contact and put the cream in the refrigerator to rest while you continue with the preparation.
Take the shortcrust pastry and roll it out into a disk 4-5 mm thick ; take a 4-inch diameter pastry cutter and make 13 disks that you can place inside 2.75-inch diameter molds with a side about 0.6 inches high, also lining the edges . Place the tartlets in the refrigerator to firm up for another 30 minutes.
Then prick the bottom with a fork's tines and line all the tartlets with parchment paper disks; place ceramic weights (or legumes like beans) to proceed with blind baking in a preheated static oven at 338°F for 15 minutes (if ventilated, 300°F for 5-10 minutes). After the necessary time, remove the weights and continue baking for another 5 minutes to let the pastry dry well. Once cooked, remove the tartlets from the oven and let them cool completely on a rack. Take the cream from the refrigerator and add the chocolate chips , then transfer the cream to a pastry bag with a 0.4-inch wide smooth tip .
Fill the now cold tartlets , then wash the wild strawberries and slice the pistachios for the final decoration ; place the wild strawberries in the center of the tartlets
further decorate the edges with dollops of ricotta cream and complete with the sliced pistachios , and your pistachio, ricotta, and wild strawberry tartlets are ready to be enjoyed !
Store the pistachio, ricotta, and wild strawberry tartlets in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. It would be best to assemble them when serving, so store the cream in the refrigerator covered with cling film for 1-2 days and the empty shells under a glass dome. You can freeze the pastry for at least 1 month and thaw it in the refrigerator as needed.
The chocolate chips should be added to the cream only when filling the tartlets! If you prefer, you can use cow or buffalo ricotta or fill with mascarpone cream and garnish with strawberries, raspberries, or mixed berries.
