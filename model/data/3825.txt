To prepare the mini panettones filled with cream and fruit, start with the Pastry cream , which will be the base of the Diplomat cream (Custard cream and whipped cream) : place a large saucepan on the heat with the milk; then slit the vanilla pod with a small knife and extract the seeds to add along with the pod to the milk . Turn on the gentle heat and when the mixture has reached a simmer, turn off the heat and let the vanilla infuse for at least 5 minutes. Meanwhile, continue the preparation by separating the egg whites from the yolks; collect the latter in a large bowl and add the sugar (with the leftover egg whites, you can prepare a delicious Angel cake some meringues, or Lingue di gatto (flat cookies) ). Whisk the egg yolks and granulated sugar with an electric mixer or a hand whisk to obtain a smooth cream. When they are white and frothy, add the sifted cornstarch or rice starch and blend it with the rest of the mixture.
Remove the vanilla pod from the heated milk and add the yolk mixture . Turn on the gentle heat again and stir continuously with a whisk to thicken the mixture . When the cream is well thickened, turn off the heat and pour it into a low, wide dish; cover it immediately with contact plastic wrap so that an annoying crust does not form ; then let it cool first at room temperature and then in the refrigerator.
Meanwhile, prepare the whipped cream that you will need to add to the custard to prepare the diplomatic cream: in the bowl of a stand mixer, pour the fresh liquid cream start to whip, then sift in the powdered sugar , and blend it with a spatula into the whipped cream .
Add the whipped cream to the now cold custard and mix initially with a spatula from top to bottom so as not to deflate it, then with a whisk until you get a frothy and homogeneous mixture . Transfer the diplomatic cream into a piping bag with a star tip.
Take the mini panettones and carefully remove the paper wrapping around them , being careful not to damage their surface. Cut off the top caps and with a small knife hollow out the inside of the mini panettones (staying about 1/2 inch from the outer edges) , then extract the dough , which you will cut into discs to form the layers to alternate with the cream.
Lightly brush the mini panettones with Grand Marnier (or another fruity liqueur such as Maraschino or Cointreau) . Using a piping bag, place about 1/2 inch of diplomatic cream on the base . Then place 2 raspberries on each mini panettone and place a disc of mini panettone on top of them and cover again with the diplomatic cream.
Garnish the top by decorating with tufts of cream ; cut the caps you had set aside in half lengthwise and place them on the mini panettone, while the other half can be decorated with the fruit to be divided for each filled mini panettone . Sprinkle with powdered sugar and your mini panettones filled with cream and fruit are ready to be enjoyed!
The stuffed mini panettones can be stored in the fridge for 4-5 days, without the fruit as decoration, because it tends to moisten the mixture.
Freezing the filled mini panettones is not recommended, while the custard or diplomatic cream can be frozen, although freezing may affect the consistency of the creams.
If, when you remove the center of the mini panettone, the dough breaks or crumbles, don't worry: cut it into pieces and use it this way to form the layers that will divide the cream or whipped cream. It might also happen that during the extraction the bottom of the mini panettone gets a hole: even in this case, do not worry. Take one or two discs of dough (or pieces) and keeping the mini panettone resting on a surface, press them well on the bottom to plug the hole.
You can also flavor the diplomatic cream with unsweetened cocoa powder!
