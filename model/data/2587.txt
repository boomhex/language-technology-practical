If you're looking for a classic Italian dessert, the Rotolo alla crema di nocciole is a must-try. Really, you can’t miss it. This chocolate hazelnut Swiss roll fits perfectly on any Italian dessert table—especially when you want something special after dinner. It all starts with a soft, moist sponge cake, known as "pan di spagna" in Italy.
Here's the thing: this cake gets its lift and lightness from whipped eggs, making it tender and perfect for rolling. Inside, you'll find a smooth hazelnut cream made the traditional way—slow-cooked hazelnuts blended with rich dark chocolate, then folded with whipped cream until it’s fluffy and creamy. Seriously good stuff.
This process gives the hazelnut cream roll its special filling, and you can really taste the care in every layer. And you know what? When you slice it, you see those beautiful spirals of cake and filling, promising a treat that’s both visually stunning and delicious. Pretty much a showstopper.
The combination of sponge cake and hazelnut cream is a favorite in Italy, and it's easy to see why. The flavors just work—the nutty depth of hazelnuts, the rich taste of chocolate, and the slight sweetness of the cake itself. Each bite offers a mix of soft cake and creamy filling, creating a winning duo that never gets old. Really really good.
Across different regions, you might find little twists—perhaps a dash of espresso in the cream or a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top for a golden finish. People slice the Nutella roll cake thick for a bigger bite or thin for a daintier dessert, making it super flexible for any meal or holiday gathering. Which is great.
Whether you call it a chocolate hazelnut roll cake , a Nutella roulade, or just a really good treat, this dessert has the heart of Italian traditions—gentle cooking, flavors, and sharing something special with loved ones. It’s the kind of homemade cake roll that makes any day feel a bit more like Italy, capturing the spirit of comfort and joy in every bite.
To prepare the hazelnut cream roll, start by making the sponge cake: in the bowl of a stand mixer, pour the eggs and part of the sugar : you will need to add the sugar in three batches, gradually as you run the stand mixer . Once finished, stop the mixer and pour in the sifted flour , then mix with a soft spatula.
Take a 12x16 inch baking tray, butter it, and line it with parchment paper, and carefully spread the batter with a spatula : you should achieve a layer no higher than 1/4 inch . Bake in a preheated static oven at 430°F for 8-9 minutes (if using a fan oven, 390°F for 4-5 minutes). Once cooked, take it out and gently detach the edges that have stuck to the pan with a small knife ;
flip the sponge cake onto a sheet of parchment paper placed on a work surface and cover it with a kitchen towel and let it cool: this way the sponge cake will not dry out. Meanwhile, prepare the cream: soak the gelatin sheets in cold water for at least 10 minutes .
Finely chop the dark chocolate , then pour the milk into a saucepan together with the sugar . Heat and as soon as it reaches a boil, remove it from the heat, add the yolks while stirring with a whisk to break them . Place back on heat for a few minutes and as soon as it returns to a boil, turn off
then add the hazelnut cream and the butter in pieces . Let it cool for a few minutes, then add the previously soaked and well-drained gelatin sheets ; melt them completely while always stirring with the whisk.
Immediately after, add the previously chopped chocolate and melt it completely while stirring. Pour the obtained mixture into a bowl and cover with cling film in contact . Let it cool at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, then an hour in the refrigerator.
After the necessary time, take the hazelnut cream again and with an immersion blender, whip it to smooth the mixture ; whip the fresh cream in a bowl with well-chilled beaters , then add it to the hazelnut cream, mixing with a soft spatula from top to bottom so as not to deflate it : your filling is ready.
When the sponge cake is cool, remove the towel and the parchment paper layer , then pass a damp cloth over the work surface and then lay out two sheets of cling film, which are 2 inches longer than the dimensions of the sponge cake, slightly overlapping .
flip the sponge cake onto the cling film and remove the other sheet of parchment paper: the dark side of the sponge cake should face up ; fill the sponge cake with a layer of hazelnut cream 1/2 inch thick, leaving about 1/2 inch from the edge . When you have finished, roll the sponge cake with the help of the cling film, starting from the longer side in front of you . As you roll, remember to remove the excess film from the edges.
After rolling, twist the excess film on the edges and while holding the ends tightly, pull with your hands outward and simultaneously move the roll away from you, allowing it to "walk" on the work surface, to tighten it like a candy. If bubbles form, pierce the film with a knife : put in the refrigerator to firm up for at least 40 minutes. Once cooled, cut the two ends with a smooth blade knife and place the roll on a serving plate. Then pour any leftover hazelnut cream into a piping bag and decorate the roll around the longer sides with small dollops .
then on the sides and finally with other cream decorations on the surface (31-32); your hazelnut cream roll is ready to be enjoyed ! You can decorate it to your liking with whole or chopped hazelnuts or chocolate chips!
The hazelnut cream roll can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of 3-4 days; it can be frozen already filled. The cream can also be frozen and thawed in the refrigerator when needed.
As a delicious variant, if you are a chocolate lover, you can make the Cocoa biscuit dough instead of the classic light sponge cake.
