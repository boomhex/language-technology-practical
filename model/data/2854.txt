To make the lasagna with green beans, potatoes, and peas, start by washing the scallions, then clean and finely slice them . Wash, peel the potatoes, and dice them , making sure to keep them immersed in a bowl of water to prevent browning. Wash the snow peas and green beans, trim the ends, and cut them into strips .
Place a pan on the stove, pour a drizzle of oil , add the sliced scallions , and stew them over low heat for at least 30 minutes with a lid on ,
until they are soft . Then season with salt and pepper. Once cooked, place the scallions in a blender bowl and blend them until you obtain a smooth sauce .
Place a large pan on the stove, heat a drizzle of olive oil and flavor with a garlic clove , then add the potatoes , drained from the water, cook them for about 10 minutes, pouring in a bit of broth to prevent the vegetables from drying out too much .
Then add the shelled peas , snow peas, and green beans . Continue cooking for another 5 minutes. The vegetables should not fall apart but remain crunchy. Season with salt, pepper, and remove the garlic clove with kitchen tongs
and set aside the cooked vegetables . Now you can focus on the béchamel sauce (to make it perfectly, consult our guide on Béchamel sauce ): place the butter in a saucepan, melt it over low heat, flavor with nutmeg , and add the sifted flour , cooking everything for a few minutes,
stirring continuously with a whisk until you obtain a creamy, lump-free mixture . At this point, remove the saucepan from the heat and add the hot broth to the mixture, stirring everything with a wooden spoon. Then, put the saucepan back on the stove, cook on low heat until the sauce starts to boil, and add a pinch of salt. Cook the béchamel sauce, always on low heat, for 15 minutes, the necessary time for the sauce to thicken , stirring occasionally.
Once the béchamel sauce is ready, incorporate the previously prepared scallion sauce , blend the mixture with an immersion blender to combine the cream and set aside. Finally, finely chop the aromatic herbs .
At this point, everything is ready to assemble the lasagna: take a baking dish measuring 12x8 inches, brush the bottom with olive oil, then spread a layer with the scallion-flavored béchamel sauce , arrange the pasta sheets vertically and start adding the vegetables
to create an even layer ; season with the herb mixture and grated Parmesan. Proceed again by placing another layer of pasta and continue alternating the ingredients until they are all used up. Finish with a layer of vegetables to season with grated Parmesan . Bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 30-40 minutes (or in a fan oven at 320°F for 20-30 minutes). When cooking is complete, take your lasagna with green beans, potatoes, and peas out of the oven, let them cool slightly, and then serve them !
You can store the lasagna with vegetable confetti in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container for 1-2 days. They can be prepared the day before, kept in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap, and baked the day after. It is possible to freeze them, only if all fresh ingredients have been used, preferably uncooked: to cook them, just thaw them in the refrigerator about 24 hours before and then bake them.
If you love bold flavors, you can replace the béchamel sauce with a tasty Parmesan cream.
