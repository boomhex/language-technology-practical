Pumpkin brioche bread—it's like a hug from a bakery. Seriously good. You get the classic French baking vibe mixed with those cozy fall flavors. The pumpkin gives it this extra moist texture and a tender crumb, and everyone loves a good homemade pumpkin brioche . You know, the slow leavening process really lets the bread develop a rich taste with that light, airy feel—just like in artisan spots.
Here's the thing: there's a gentle sweetness from the pumpkin, plus chewy raisins scattered throughout. Super super yummy. Imagine tearing off a golden piece, still warm, and spreading on some salted butter or your favorite jam. Some folks even add a hint of orange zest—makes it pop! But honestly, the base recipe keeps it simple, focusing on that soft, comforting bite.
A thick slice of pumpkin brioche bread is perfect for breakfast or a late snack. And look, unlike your regular pumpkin bread or pumpkin spice bread, this brioche takes patience with its slow mixing, letting the dough rise beautifully.
The eggs and butter richness, mixed with pumpkin, make every bite a little fluffy, a little sweet, and just a tad chewy with those raisins. Pretty versatile. Try it with jams, honey, or even some cream cheese if you're feeling savory.
For real, many folks say this is one of the best fall baking recipes, but pumpkin brioche bread is something you can enjoy all year. It's one of those pumpkin ideas that really really delivers—simple, warm, and inviting. Like, just imagine that fresh-baked aroma wafting through your kitchen.
Share it with friends or family. And the tender crumb? It reminds you why homemade is always worth it. Pumpkin brioche bread —can't go wrong. Pretty much.
To prepare the pumpkin brioche bread, start by cutting a vanilla bean and removing the seeds that you will set aside to flavor the dough: place the pod in a steamer pot filled with water . Turn on the heat to warm the water. While the water is getting aromatic, proceed with cleaning the pumpkin: remove the outer peel , seeds, and fibers with a spoon, then cut it into thin slices.
Place the steamer in which the sliced pumpkin is arranged into the pot . Cover with a lid and let the pumpkin steam for about 30 minutes or until it becomes soft. To check if it’s done, you can do the toothpick test. Once softened, mash the pumpkin with a potato masher in a large bowl and keep it warm. If you have already cooked pumpkin, you can use 12.7 oz for this recipe.
At this point, prepare the dough: in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, add the two sifted flours, the sugar , the yeast , and the beaten egg .
Also add the cooked pumpkin pulp while it is still warm and, while mixing on low speed, slowly pour in the milk at room temperature . Continue working the dough and when it becomes fairly homogeneous, add the vanilla bean seeds . Let the mixer run for another 10 minutes.
Finally, add the salt and let the mixer, set to medium speed, incorporate the ingredient into the dough. Then, add the butter, slightly softened at room temperature, a little at a time . Add a piece each time the previous one has been fully absorbed into the dough. When the dough is well wrapped around the hook, add the raisins (no need to soak them beforehand) : let them incorporate by letting the mixer run for another 3-4 minutes.
The dough will now be wrapped around the hook and the raisins well mixed with the other ingredients : transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface (if you prefer, you can oil your hands to facilitate working with the dough) and fold it to strengthen it by bringing the edges inward . After working it, form it into a ball and place it in a bowl that you will place in a turned-off oven with the light on to rise for 2 hours and 30 minutes or until it has doubled in volume .
After the necessary time, transfer it to a lightly floured work surface and shape it into a loaf . Divide the loaf into 8 pieces, each approximately 4.6 oz , and form each into small balls of dough .
Place 4 of them side by side in a greased and floured loaf pan measuring 8x4.3 inches and repeat the operation for the second pan (alternatively, you can use a single pan that measures twice the indicated size; if you don’t have two pans of the same size, you can make a classic loaf brioche and let the remaining dough rise by forming rolls, as noted in the box below). Let it rise in a turned-off oven with the light on for another hour or until it has doubled in volume. After the final rise, brush the pumpkin brioche bread with the beaten yolk with cream and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 30 minutes (if you don’t have a static oven but a convection one, you can bake at 320°F for 20 minutes), always remembering to do the toothpick test to check if it’s done. Once the baking time is up, remove the pan from the oven , let it rest for 10 minutes before enjoying this soft pumpkin brioche bread!
If you don’t have the indicated loaf pans, if you only have one, or if you prefer to give a different shape to this dough, you can proceed as indicated above to make the dough. Once it has risen, form it into a loaf to get 8 pieces, each about 4.6 oz : shape each into a ball and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, well-spaced apart from each other .
Beat the yolk with the fresh liquid cream and brush the entire surface of the rolls and let rise for an hour in a turned-off oven with the light on: they should double in volume. Then bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 30 minutes (if you have a convection oven, bake at 320°F for about 20 minutes). Then remove the baking sheet from the oven, let your pumpkin rolls rest for about 10 minutes, and the rolls are ready !
The pumpkin brioche bread can be stored at room temperature under a glass dome for about 2 days.
If you’ve used only fresh and not thawed ingredients, you can also freeze the baked preparation. You can also freeze it uncooked, before the final rise: to finish the preparation, thaw at room temperature and follow the photo recipe.
For an even more fragrant dough, flavor with the untreated zest of a lemon, orange, or lime. And for those who simply can’t resist indulgence, we recommend irresistible substitutions: chocolate chips or chopped pistachios instead of raisins!
