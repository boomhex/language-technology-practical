Tegole dolci are these super tasty Italian almond cookies from the beautiful Valle d’Aosta. Really, imagine a cookie that's crispy and elegantly curved, just like those classic clay roof tiles in the Italian Alps. What makes them special is their simple ingredient list combined with a rich nutty flavor from toasted hazelnuts and almonds. It's all about tradition. This recipe has been cherished for generations, and the secret? It's in placing the warm cialde over a rolling pin to get that distinctive bend. Each bite is light, tender, and carries a sweet aroma, perfect with your morning espresso or afternoon tea.
If you’re a fan of traditional Italian cookies or just hunting for new treats, tegole dolci are a must-try! In Valle d’Aosta, these cookies often round off a meal with a glass of local dry white wine—Nus Malvoisie Flétri. It really really enhances their nutty flavors. And listen, you can also enjoy them at breakfast with a robust espresso or as a fancy snack with tea. Tegole dolci are light and golden, offering just the right amount of crunch to keep things interesting, while the moist nutty interior keeps them so so good. Unlike Sicilian almond cookies or other almond biscuits from various Italian regions, tegole dolci are celebrated for their wafer-like texture and subtle taste.
Here's the deal: with only a few ingredients and a unique shaping technique, they show that Italian baking can be both simple and incredibly tasty. These Italian dessert recipes are easy to adore—no need for anything fancy, just delicious, crisp, and nutty cookies that fit seamlessly into any part of your day. Whether you're indulging at breakfast, teatime, or as a dessert, tegole dolci offer a genuine taste of Italian tradition with every bite. For real.
To prepare the sweet tiles, start by toasting the almonds and hazelnuts: line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the almonds and hazelnuts on it . Bake in a preheated static oven at 300°F for 30 minutes or at 265°F for 25 minutes if using a convection oven. After this time, let everything cool and then peel the almonds and hazelnuts with your hands, then transfer them to a mixer along with half of the total sugar amount . Blend for a few seconds, until everything is crumbled .
Transfer the almond and hazelnut flour to a large bowl and add the butter that you have previously melted , mix until compact, helping yourself with a spatula . Add the vanilla seeds, pour the flour into a sieve and sift it directly into the bowl containing the mixture , mix well and set aside.
Now place the egg whites in a bowl and whip them with an electric mixer . As soon as they start to whip, add the other half of the sugar and continue until you get a fluffy and frothy mixture. Then combine the whipped egg whites with the mixture .
Mix with a spatula to blend and obtain a homogeneous mixture . Line the baking sheet again with parchment paper and place small amounts of dough, about 0.35 oz each, 1-1.5 inches apart. Flatten each drop of dough with the back of a spoon , forming circles with a diameter of about 2.75 inches and thin 1/2 millimeter. To make this operation easier, wet the back of the spoon so that the dough does not stick too much to the surface. Once this operation is complete, bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 8 minutes or at 320°F for 3-4 minutes if using a convection oven. When they are slightly crunchy and browned, take them out of the oven and place them on a rolling pin, in this way they will dry and acquire their typical curved shape . All you have to do is serve your sweet tiles accompanied by an excellent dry white wine!
You can store the sweet tiles in a tin box for up to 1 week. Freezing is not recommended.
Well, here we are clearly in the realm of delights. If you want to go overboard and make your sweet tiles even sweeter, you can add a little honey to the dough. If, on the other hand, you are already on the front line for tasting, get yourself a bottle of good dry and delicate white (for example a typical nectar from the Aosta Valley, the Nus Malvoisie Flétri) and fall madly in love with this wonder!
