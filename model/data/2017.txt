To create the holiday starter, start by making the base: sift chickpea flour and all-purpose flour in a bowl, then add the baking powder .
Add the salt , then start mixing with a whisk while gradually pouring in the water until it is fully incorporated (5-6).
When the mixture is smooth and lump-free , you can proceed with cooking: heat a small non-stick pan and pour a ladle of batter , cook for 2-3 minutes, then flip the blinis with a spatula ,
continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes until golden brown . As they cook, place them on a plate . Continue cooking the blinis until the batter is finished. With the indicated amounts, you will get 12 blinis. Now take care of the avocado: cut it in half
Remove the pit , peel the fruit with a knife and then cut each half into very thin slices .
Form each rose with about 10 thin slices of avocado in this way: keep the slices close together, fan them out with the help of a knife and the palm of your hand sliding them vertically. Then roll them into a spiral to give them the typical rose shape .
Everything is ready to assemble the starter: take a blinis, place a slice of prosciutto and an avocado rose on top. Accompany the starter with a couple of tablespoons of orange marmalade (to make it more liquid you can slightly blend it with an immersion blender and immediately serve your raw starter and avocado.
It is recommended to consume the raw starter and avocado immediately; you can store the cooked blinis in the refrigerator for about 3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
For a fish version, you can replace the prosciutto with slices of smoked salmon. For the best roses, use large, firm avocados that are not too ripe.
