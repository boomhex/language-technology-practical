Risotto with Grana Padano cream is, I gotta say, a total delight from Northern Italy. Really, it’s especially loved in Lombardy and Piedmont—places where rice dishes are like, seriously, an art form. This isn’t your typical risotto . It’s got a fun twist with creamy Grana Padano cheese and a unique beer reduction . To be honest, the rich flavor from the cheese gives it that classic Northern Italian vibe, and the beer and coffee reduction? Well, it adds some really cool elements.
The mix of toasty grains, a touch of bitterness from the coffee, and savory cheese—it's just magic. You know, Italian chefs are masters at this, balancing flavors while keeping it true to a great risotto. Every spoonful is smooth and silky, with a flavor that’s both robust and balanced. And look, the coffee-infused risotto finish? It’s something else. Not your usual rice dish, that’s for sure.
Northern Italy’s known for its cool take on risotto, and this dish, well, it really captures that spirit. More than just rice—it’s like a gourmet risotto you’d find in a chic Milanese spot. Sure, a beer and coffee risotto might sound bold, but here's the thing, it works. And the aroma? Totally captivating. You get this nutty, sweet scent from the cheese and a deep, earthy vibe from the coffee reduction.
For folks who love unique risotto flavors , this is a must-try. The texture is moist but not too heavy, so the sharp cheese and those slightly bitter, dark notes from the coffee-beer sauce can really shine. It's a dish you’ll keep wanting more of—no question. It highlights what’s possible with Italian risotto when tradition meets innovation. If you’re up for exploring Italian cooking, this dish is your ticket. It’s an adventure into modern culinary arts while, you know, respecting those age-old traditions from its home regions.
First, start by preparing the beer reduction. We recommend preparing it the day before and storing it at room temperature. Place a pot on the stove, pour the beer inside , and turn the heat to high. As soon as the beer heats up, foam will begin to form . Be careful as the beer tends to rise and could overflow from the pot. Then lower the heat and cook for about 1 hour , stirring occasionally until the alcoholic part has completely evaporated and you have achieved a caramel-like consistency, with an amber color.
Then let it cool and transfer it to a kitchen squeeze bottle . At this point, prepare the vegetable broth and once filtered, make sure it's boiling when you cook the risotto. Proceed to the Grana Padano cream. Grate it at the moment, using a zest grater , only this way will you obtain the right final consistency of the cream. Pour the cream into a saucepan and heat it on the stove until it reaches a temperature of about 158°F .
Add the grated Grana Padano and mix with a whisk to blend it . When the cheese is completely melted, blend the cream with an immersion blender . Once you have the right consistency, keep the cream in a bain-marie at 140°F to keep it warm.
Next, move on to the rice. Heat a pan, add the rice inside , and dry-toast it, stirring occasionally. During the toasting, add a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper .
Add the boiling broth until it is fully covered . Bring the rice to cooking by gradually adding more broth. As soon as it is almost cooked, adjust the salt and pepper, and adjust the consistency by adding more broth if necessary. At this point, turn off the heat .
Add the cold butter from the refrigerator and stir the risotto to make it creamy . As soon as the butter is fully incorporated, add the grated cheese and continue stirring the risotto,
shaking the pan and stirring with a wooden spoon until it is well mixed. Everything is ready, it's time to plate. Using a spoon, place the risotto on the plate ,
tap the bottom with your hand to flatten it . Add the Grana Padano cream on top, using a spoon , then the coffee powder
and finish with the beer reduction , creating a spiral . Serve the risotto and enjoy it while it's still hot .
It is recommended to consume the risotto immediately. Only the beer reduction can be prepared a day in advance and stored at room temperature.
Keep the broth always boiling to avoid the thermal shock of the rice and to have perfect cooking.
The dry toasting is to avoid excess fat and to keep the rice's aromas intact.
To stir the risotto, always use cold butter from the fridge, this will give you the right creaminess.
Prepare the beer reduction a day before, this way the flavors will settle.
It's important to heat the cream, bringing it to 158°F, because when you add the cheese, it will melt immediately and you'll get the right consistency.
It's very important to grate the cheese by hand, this way the cream will become much smoother and, above all, more homogeneous.
