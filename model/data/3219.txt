After this time, take the flatbreads and, using kitchen tongs, place a bit of speck and leek mixture on each of them .

If you want to enrich these finger foods, place a cube of cheese, such as Fontina, on each flatbread and put them under the grill setting in the oven to get a tasty gratin, or melt a few pieces of cheese with a splash of milk in a saucepan and place a teaspoon of melted cheese on each flatbread.
