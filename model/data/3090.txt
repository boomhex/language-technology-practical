To prepare the mini pistachio plumcakes with Nesquik heart, put the room temperature butter in the bowl of a stand mixer, equipped with a whisk, along with the sugar and mix everything by starting the mixer . With the mixer on, take the vanilla pod, split it in half, extract the seeds, and add the vanilla seeds to the butter and sugar mixture ,
also add the pistachio paste , yogurt , the eggs one at a time , and a pinch of salt. When the eggs have been incorporated into the mixture
also add the sifted flour and baking powder and the chopped pistachios ; let everything blend until you get a thick and homogeneous mixture. If you don't have a stand mixer, you can use a whisk to mix, being careful to add the ingredients little by little to avoid lumps. Now prepare the Nesquik heart: take 100 g of dough and put it in a separate bowl, add the Nesquik and mix it with the pistachio mixture until you get a homogeneous dough.
Line a rectangular baking pan of 6x4 inches with parchment paper and pour in the pistachio and Nesquik mixture, leveling it well with a spatula . Bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 20 minutes (or in a convection oven at 300°F for 15 minutes). The result should be a very soft and moist cake inside with a crispy crust . Let the cake cool (to facilitate cutting, you can put it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes) and then cut it into sticks of 2.5x0.75 inches : in this way, you will have obtained the heart of your mini plumcakes.
Line 8 plumcake molds with parchment paper of dimensions 2.25x3.25 inches with a border 1.5 inches high: lightly butter the molds and cut 8 rectangles of parchment paper 2.25x3.25 inches, which will cover the bottom of the molds, and 8 strips 1.5 inches high and 11 inches long for the walls, make sure the parchment paper adheres well to the molds to avoid folds and fill them 2/3 full with the pistachio mixture. At this point, place the heart in the center of the plumcakes (14-15)
and cover everything up to the edge with more pistachio mixture (16-17). Bake in a preheated static oven for 35 minutes at 340°F (or in a convection oven for 25 minutes at 300°F) until the surface of the plumcakes begins to turn golden . Remove the mini pistachio plumcakes with Nesquik heart from the oven, let them cool slightly, and enjoy!
The mini plumcakes can be stored under a glass dome or in an airtight container outside the refrigerator for 3-4 days. It is possible to freeze the mini plumcakes after baking.
You can make a single pistachio plumcake with Nesquik heart using a 8x5 inch plumcake mold and using multiple sticks lined up next to each other to form the heart of the plumcake. Choose the size of the plumcakes' heart by cutting more or less large sticks from the Nesquik cake.
