instructions:
To prepare the crispy zucchini chips, start by washing and drying the zucchinis, then trim them , and with the help of a mandolin (for a more precise result) or a knife, slice them thinly to get 1/8 inch rounds .
Place them in a bowl, add the salt and the flour , then mix .
Pour in the oil and the fresh oregano leaves . Then mix again .
Transfer the zucchinis to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, trying to overlap them as little as possible. Drizzle with a bit more oil and proceed to bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F, for about 25 minutes . Here are your crispy zucchini chips ready, serve them in cones or on a plate .
Although it's best to consume them immediately to retain their crispness, if needed, you can store the crispy zucchini chips in the refrigerator for up to two days.
Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of flour, you can try using breadcrumbs.
Instead of fresh oregano, you can use dried oregano or replace it with other aromatic herbs like parsley, thyme, and marjoram.
