instructions:
To make the cabbage and shallot salad, start by peeling the shallots , then heat water with a pinch of coarse salt and red wine vinegar in a saucepan.
Add the shallots and boil them for 5 minutes. Then drain the shallots using a slotted spoon and transfer them to a small bowl .

Let them cool slightly, then cut the shallots into wedges ; next, deal with the salted anchovies: scrape off the excess salt with a knife, then cut them in half lengthwise and remove the central bone , at this point rinse the anchovy fillets under running water. Take the cabbage: we used white cabbage, but you can also use savoy cabbage if you prefer; cut it in half, remove the core at the center, which is the hardest part .
Thinly slice the cabbage into strips . Place the cabbage in a bowl and season with a little salt (you can also omit it since the anchovies provide a strong flavor), pepper then add the cleaned anchovy fillets
Also add the shallot wedges and season with olive oil . Your cabbage and shallot salad is ready to be served .
An extra aromatic touch? Flavor the cabbage and shallot salad with fresh thyme or basil, it will be even more fragrant!
It is preferable to consume the cabbage and shallot salad immediately or store it in the refrigerator for a maximum of one day in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
