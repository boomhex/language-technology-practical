To prepare the puff pastries with speck and black cabbage, start by washing the black cabbage under running water. Remove the outer leaves if they have imperfections and are too tough, then cut the other leaves into julienne strips . Drizzle a large pan with a little oil and add the cabbage strips : let the black cabbage wilt for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the speck into cubes of the same size .
After the 5 minutes, add them to the black cabbage . Let cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon , then salt to taste .
Now that your topping is ready, turn off the heat and start assembling your tasty finger food: place the classic puff pastries on the cutting board and place a tuft of black cabbage and speck cubes on each, using kitchen tongs (7-8). Serve your puff pastries with speck and black cabbage warm or cold as an appetizer !
