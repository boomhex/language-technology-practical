To prepare the Father's Day cake, start with the sponge cake: pour the eggs, yolks , sugar , and a pinch of salt into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisks.
Whip the mixture for about 10 minutes at maximum speed until it becomes very frothy. Meanwhile, sift the flour, starch , and cocoa into a bowl.
Sift the powders a second time , as this will help achieve a very soft sponge cake. Once the sugar and egg mixture is well whipped , gently fold in the powders with a spatula, little by little , mixing from bottom to top.
The batter is ready , so pour it into a greased and floured 10-inch diameter pan . Level the surface with the back of a spoon and bake the sponge cake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 30-35 minutes. Before removing from the oven, check for doneness with a toothpick. Let it cool completely in the pan .
Focus on preparing the syrup: pour the water and sugar into a saucepan, then heat over moderate heat .
As soon as the mixture reaches a boil , remove it from the stove. Allow the mixture to cool, then add the rum , stir with a whisk, and set aside .
Prepare the cream: in a saucepan, pour water and instant coffee , heat the mixture on the stove, and stir until the coffee is completely dissolved without lumps . In a bowl, combine the mascarpone and powdered sugar .
Add the coffee and whip the cream with electric beaters to combine .
Finally, incorporate the liquid cream and whip until you achieve a dense and compact consistency, yet smooth and creamy .
When the sponge cake is cool, remove the top crust with a serrated knife . Make a horizontal cut in the center of the sponge cake to create two equal halves ready to be filled .
Place the first sponge cake disc on the serving plate and lightly soak it with the rum syrup using a brush . Transfer the cream to a piping bag and distribute it over the first sponge cake disc .
Level the cream with a spatula to achieve a smooth surface . With the brush, moisten the inner part of the second sponge cake disc .
Place the second disc on top of the cream and brush the opposite side with syrup as well . Use the piping bag to pipe dollops of cream along the edge .
Spread more cream over the top , then smooth the entire cake with a spatula .
You need to achieve a perfectly smooth surface . Adhere cocoa sprinkles to the edge of the cake. Leave the cake in the freezer for 20-30 minutes so that the cream on the surface hardens, but the center of the cake does not start to freeze. After the rest in the freezer, place the stencil on the surface of the cake and dust with cocoa using a sifter . Carefully remove the stencil, making sure not to drop cocoa onto the cake. Clean the edge of the plate of any cocoa residue with a paper towel.
Transfer the remaining coffee cream to a piping bag with a star tip and pipe rosettes all along the edge . Place a chocolate coffee bean on top of each cream tuft . Let the Father's Day cake rest in the refrigerator for at least 2-3 hours before serving .
The Father's Day cake can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days.
You can prepare the sponge cake in advance and store it under a glass dome for 3-4 days.
You can also make this cake with classic sponge cake, just replace the cocoa with the same amount of starch.
For an alcohol-free version, you can eliminate the liquor and infuse aromas like cinnamon sticks, vanilla, or citrus peels when bringing the mixture to a boil.
If you wish, you can add some chopped chocolate shavings with a knife on top of the cream layer inside.
