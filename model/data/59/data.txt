All about balance. Toasted gluten-free breadcrumbs add a crispy finish—making every bite more fun—and adding another layer to the whole experience.

And look, it’s perfect for anyone avoiding gluten, offering more nutrition and a unique taste compared to regular wheat pasta. Anchovies do double duty, loading the dish with omega-3s and enhancing the flavors of tomatoes and olive oil. Which is great. This healthy pasta dish is one you can feel good about, with all the flavor and none of the heaviness.
Pretty much perfect for a quick weeknight meal and impressive enough for guests.
