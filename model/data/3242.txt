Mandarini ripieni are a really tasty treat you’ll find in Southern Italy when citrus season is, like, at its peak. Imagine this: fresh, juicy mandarins—hollowed out, frozen shells—and the insides filled with a creamy, tangy mix of eggs, sugar, and lots of strained mandarin juice. Once it thickens on the stove, whipped cream is folded in. Makes it super smooth and light. A touch of gelatin keeps it just right, especially when it’s cold from the freezer. And the taste? You crack into one, and it’s a burst of sweet, zesty mandarin flavor. Seriously good, like a breath of fresh air after a big meal. And listen, it’s not heavy at all. These dessert con mandarini are known for being refreshing and easy on the stomach—something folks really appreciate in Italy, especially in the south after a hearty dinner.
During the holidays, or when citrus is at its best, mandarini ripieni are the go-to for families wanting something homemade and unique. Way better than the usual cakes or cookies. You’ll find this ricetta mandarini ripieni in kitchens across Calabria and Sicily, where mandarins have this almost floral taste that sets these desserts apart. I mean, a big part of the charm is how simple they look. Just mandarins, but inside? They’re hiding a velvety, dolci con mandarini cream. Feels kinda fancy. People love how the fruit shells keep everything chilled and moist, making each bite cool and fragrant. Like eating a piece of frozen sunshine, for real.
Thing is, this isn’t just a pretty dessert— mandarini farciti have a reputation for being great "digestivi," helping you feel better after a rich meal. Out of all the ricette dolci facili you might choose, this one captures that classic Italian knack for turning simple, fresh fruit into something special. And everyone at the table will talk about it. It’s a perfect way to celebrate the bright flavors of Southern Italy’s citrus bounty. Can’t go wrong!
To prepare stuffed mandarins, choose 8 of your largest and most beautiful mandarins, without any bruises, then cut off the top cap and scoop them out using a teaspoon, removing the pulp without damaging the peel . Wrap the whole peels and caps, one by one, in plastic wrap and put them in the freezer for at least an hour.
Peel the other mandarins and blend them together with the previously removed pulp in a mixer (4-5). Strain the juice through a sieve, pressing the pulp with the back of a spoon .
In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with the sugar until they become soft and light , add the cornstarch and juice of half a lemon , mix and finally add the mandarin juice .
Transfer the obtained mixture into a pot, passing it through a sieve first to remove any lumps . Cook the cream over low heat, stirring constantly until it thickens (this will take about 15 minutes). Remove from heat and let the cream cool, covered with a sheet of plastic wrap in contact in the refrigerator .
When the mandarin cream is completely cold, whip 200 ml of cream in a stand mixer or with an electric beater and mix it with the cream . Soak a sheet of gelatin in cold water for a few minutes, squeeze it, and dissolve it in the remaining 50 ml of cream, which you have heated, and add this mixture to the cream .
Finally, add the grated zest of one lemon, mix, and cover with a sheet of plastic wrap always in contact. Let the cream rest in the refrigerator for about 3 hours: it should become thick and compact. Transfer it into a pastry bag with a star tip, take the frozen peels out of the freezer, remove the plastic wrap, and fill them with the cream , forming a nice final tuft . Decorate with the cap and place your stuffed mandarins in the freezer until 20 minutes before serving!
You can keep the stuffed mandarins in the freezer for 3-4 days and take them out 20 minutes before serving.
A spice that pairs very well with citrus fruits is cinnamon! If you prefer a warmer and more enveloping taste, you can use it to flavor the cream. You can add candied mandarin or orange peels covered in chocolate. With the same method, you can also fill oranges and lemons.
