instructions:
To make the polenta pizza, first prepare the vegetables: clean the Brussels sprouts and cut them in half , then peel the shallot and slice it . Remove the earthy base of the champignon mushrooms and also slice them .
Wash the pumpkin and slice it thinly without peeling , then further halve the slices . Gather all the ingredients in a bowl and also add the chanterelles, which you have gently cleaned with a damp cloth .
Season with oil , salt , and pepper, then mix everything by massaging with your hands .
Place the vegetables on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and cook in a preheated static oven at 428°F for 20-25 minutes . Meanwhile, prepare the black kale cream: remove the central rib from the black kale leaves , then blanch them for 3-4 minutes .
Drain the black kale and transfer to a blender, then add the sundried tomatoes with their oil and the chili pepper . Blend until you have a creamy consistency and set aside . Slice the mozzarella and place it in a colander to drain excess water.
To prepare the polenta, bring a pot of water to a boil with 3 teaspoons of salt, then sprinkle in the cornmeal . Cook for the time indicated on the package, stirring with a whisk . Grease a baking sheet lined with parchment paper with oil .
Once ready, pour half of the polenta onto the baking sheet (the amount is for 2 trays) and level it with the back of a spoon, using a little oil if necessary . Top with half of the sliced mozzarella and half of the taleggio cheese in pieces , then add dollops of black kale cream. Bake in static mode at 410°F for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven and let rest for a few minutes. Switch to grill mode and bake again for 2 minutes to gratinate the cheese .
At this point, remove from the oven and distribute half of the vegetables, then garnish with walnuts and thyme . Place the baking sheet back under the grill for 3-5 minutes, then finish with a grind of pepper. Proceed in the same way to prepare the second tray and serve your polenta pizza hot !
The polenta pizza can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
You can store the black kale cream for a few days in the refrigerator, in an airtight jar covered with a layer of oil.
If using leftover polenta, just place the slices as close as possible in the tray and cover everything with cheese that, when melted, will keep it all together!
The mozzarella will tend to release some water during baking, so it's necessary to let the polenta pizza rest after the first gratin to absorb the excess liquid. If you prefer, you can use pizza mozzarella, which is drier.
The kale and sundried tomato cream is a flavor concentrate, ideal for adding umami to many recipes like bruschetta and flatbreads. Make plenty and store it as indicated!
