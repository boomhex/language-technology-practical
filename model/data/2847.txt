instructions:
To make the sliced beef with aromatic herbs, cut the rump steak to obtain a 500 g slice about 1.5-2 inches thick (1-2). Meanwhile, prepare the herb mixture that will flavor the sliced beef: remove the woody part of the rosemary leaving only the needles, place them on a cutting board, add sage leaves, marjoram, thyme, and parsley , finely chop the herbs with a knife.
Place the obtained mixture in a bowl, season with salt , freshly ground black pepper , and olive oil , mix the obtained emulsion and use it
to brush the slice of meat on both sides . Proceed with cooking the sliced beef: put a grill on the stove, sprinkle the surface with coarse salt . When the grill is hot, place the slice of meat: to achieve perfect cooking, cook on both sides for a maximum of 3-4 minutes, turning it with a spatula . By cooking for only a few minutes, the steak will remain pink inside and retain all its juices; it is recommended not to extend the cooking time, otherwise the meat will be too dry inside.
Once cooking is completed , place the still-hot meat on a cutting board and cut it into slices about 0.4 inches thick . Serve immediately the sliced beef with aromatic herbs while still hot and accompany it with tasty sides like Potato boats with cheddar and bacon or, if you prefer a lighter side, serve it with a mixed salad.
It is recommended to consume the sliced beef with aromatic herbs immediately; if there are leftovers, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to one day. Freezing is not recommended.
To make sliced beef with herbs, besides rump steak, you can use other cuts such as filet, sirloin, or entrecote.
