instructions:
To prepare the grilled leeks, first, clean the leeks: cut off the root and the greener leaves . Make a slight longitudinal cut to remove another two layers of leaves
Thus obtaining about 1.4 lbs of tender leek hearts . Wash the cleaned leeks under running water and set them aside. Fill a large saucepan with water and place it on the stove. As soon as it starts boiling, add salt
and immerse the leeks . Cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes. Drain the leeks and transfer them to a colander to remove any excess water . Heat a non-stick grill pan and grill the leeks , turning them occasionally, for about 10 minutes.
When the leeks are well grilled , place the leeks on a serving platter . Wash the aromatic herbs thoroughly and chop them finely on a cutting board .
In a bowl, pour the olive oil, season with pepper and salt, and add the chopped aromatic herbs . Mix with a fork to emulsify the dressing .
Drizzle the grilled leeks first with the prepared aromatic oil and then with balsamic vinegar . Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes in the fridge before serving .
Grilled leeks can be stored in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 2 days. It's not advisable to freeze them. They can be blanched in advance and seasoned later.
Use the leftover leek leaves to make a vegetable broth.
