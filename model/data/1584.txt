To make the baked conchiglioni with prawn and hake ragout with saffron, first prepare the béchamel: place the soft butter and flour in a saucepan . Turn on the low heat and quickly stir with a wooden spoon . With the heat, the butter will melt and create a sort of golden cream with the flour. Pour in the milk
and stir with a whisk . Season with a pinch of salt and nutmeg
and stir until the béchamel thickens . Shell the prawns by removing the head, the legs , and then the shell .
With a small knife, make an incision along the back of the prawn and remove the intestine by pulling it out with your hands . Once cleaned, you will have about 9 oz of prawns. Rinse them under running water, then place the prawns on a cutting board and cut them into pieces . Fillet the hake by removing the skin. Start from the tail end. Make an incision with a sharp knife separating the skin from the flesh. Use your hand to pull the flap of skin and continue until it is completely removed.
Also cut the hake into pieces . Now wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them into 4 parts . Remove the needles from the rosemary and chop them finely . Meanwhile, place a pot full of salted water on the stove, which will be used for cooking the pasta.
In a pan, heat a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and brown a garlic clove cut in half . Add the prawns and then the hake .
Sauté for just a couple of seconds and add a pinch of salt, a pinch of pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg and stir. Deglaze with the white wine and let it evaporate. Also add the saffron dissolved in 3-4 tablespoons of hot water and stir, then add the butter
and the chopped rosemary . Now add the cherry tomatoes and half a cup of water , stir and cook for 1-2 minutes.
Turn off the heat and let the prawn and hake ragout cool . Now, cook the pasta very al dente, adjusting according to the cooking time indicated on the package . In a 9.5 x 9.5-inch baking dish, pour a ladle of béchamel on the bottom .
Stuff each conchiglioni with the prawn and hake ragout and place them on the baking dish , then cover with the béchamel .
Sprinkle with grated cheese , drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and bake in a static oven at 375°F for 25 minutes, then cook for another 10 minutes in grill mode. Once cooked, remove the conchiglioni and let them cool slightly before serving .
The prawn and hake ragout conchiglioni can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
As an alternative to béchamel, you can use tomato sauce.
