instructions:
To clean and fillet the trout, you first need to eviscerate it: use the scissors to cut the belly and proceed straight up under the head, then use your hands to gather the innards and remove them. Wash the fish's belly well under running water to remove any remaining traces of blood. If you want to cook the whole fish, in the oven or on the grill, the cleaning ends here, and the trout is ready to be seasoned and cooked. If you need fillets instead, place the trout on the cutting board and use the fish filleting knife to cut the head and remove it , then cut the tail and the dorsal part of the fish along the spine , starting from the top, and move the blade horizontally to the work surface to obtain the first fillet .
Now separate the two halves of the fish. Proceed in the same way (4-5), but separate the flesh from the bone to obtain the second fillet (be careful not to remove too much pulp in this operation). Remove any bones present using kitchen tweezers (help yourself by passing a hand over the pulp to locate the bones) ,
then remove the skin using the knife along the skin, gently running it from the tail to the other end , to avoid wasting the fish's flesh. Finish your fillets by removing the part near the belly, which contains the most bones . At this point, your trout fillets are ready to be cooked !
You can store the trout fillets in the refrigerator for up to one day, sealed in an airtight container.
It is possible to freeze the fillets: place them on a sheet of baking paper and let them harden in the freezer for an hour, then transfer them to a transparent freezer bag and put them back in the freezer; this way, you will prevent them from sticking to the bag.
