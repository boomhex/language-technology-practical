instructions:
To prepare the zucchini burgers, we start by boiling the potatoes. Place them in cold water and from the moment of boiling, count from 30 to 50 minutes . Check with a fork; when they are tender at the center, drain and peel them while hot . Finally, mash them and let them cool .
After cleaning the zucchinis, trim and remove the outer part with a peeler , set aside as it will be needed later . Grate the light part of the zucchinis with a large-hole grater .
Clean and chop the shallot , add it to a pan with a bit of oil . Sauté for a short time, stirring occasionally, then add the zucchinis .
Cook at high heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, add a little salt . Transfer to a bowl and let it cool slightly . Meanwhile, finely chop mint and parsley leaves .
Add the herbs to the bowl with the zucchinis and add the eggs , almond flour, and grated cheese , the potato starch .
Add the soy sauce and the mashed potatoes . At this point, you can knead everything to obtain a homogeneous mixture; make sure it is seasoned correctly .
Let the mixture rest for a few minutes . In a baking dish, pour the breadcrumbs, place a pastry cutter about 4 inches in diameter and 1.2 inches high and fill with the mixture . Form 5 zucchini burgers and sprinkle the top with breadcrumbs .
Heat a drizzle of oil in a non-stick pan and cook the patties . When the base is golden and crispy, turn and cook the other side as well . While they cook, you can use the zucchini exterior as a side, garnishing to taste with salt and oil .
Mix to season , plate and enjoy your warm zucchini burgers .
If you want, you can prepare the zucchini burgers a day in advance and keep them in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap.
Freezing is not recommended.
Try to flavor the mix with spices like smoked paprika for a bold touch or turmeric for a more tangy taste; as an alternative to the previously suggested aromatic herbs, thyme or mint also work well.
Ensure that the zucchinis do not release water after being sautéed in the pan. If they do, drain them well: this will prevent you from having to add more almond flour or cheese to the mixture.
Using almond flour and potato starch, instead of regular flour, will give a pleasant texture to the mixture.
