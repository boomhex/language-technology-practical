instructions:
To prepare the rice pudding, start with the shortcrust pastry: pour the flour into a large bowl , add the sugar and mix .

Then add the salt , the egg , and mix everything with a spoon .
Now add the butter , kept at room temperature for at least ten minutes, and mix it as well, first with the spoon and then with your hands .
Knead the shortcrust pastry by hand for a few minutes ; it doesn't need to be worked for long, just enough to have a smooth, soft, and well-mixed dough . Once ready, place the shortcrust pastry in a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, then put it in the fridge and let it rest for at least an hour .
To prepare the rice cream, pour the rice into a pot , add the milk , and vanilla extract .
Then add the lemon zest , orange zest , and a pinch of salt .

Cook the rice cream for about 25-30 minutes on low heat, keeping an eye on it and stirring occasionally. Once cooked, the rice will have absorbed all the milk , then you can remove the zest . At this point, transfer the rice cream into a large glass bowl .
Let it cool and start on the custard. In a pot, pour the egg yolks and the sugar .
Then add the starch and start mixing with a whisk . Next, gradually add the milk .

As you mix with the whisk , to prevent lumps from forming, also add the lemon zest . At this point, cook the cream on low heat until it thickens ; it will take about 10 minutes .
Remove the lemon zest and also transfer the cream into a glass bowl to cool . When the cream is cold, incorporate it into the rice cream .
Mix to combine . If the cream is too thick, you can add a little milk. Butter and flour a 12-muffin mold.

Take the shortcrust pastry out of the fridge , roll it out on a floured surface with the help of a rolling pin, to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. Cut out circles with a 3-4 inch diameter cookie cutter. Then place the circles inside the mold , pressing them well against the edges and bottom. Fill the shortcrust pastry baskets with the cream .

Bake the rice puddings at 350°F for about 40 minutes in the center rack of the oven, using the fan setting; times may vary slightly depending on the oven, check for a golden color. Remove the rice puddings from the oven , let them cool, then remove them from the mold and decorate with powdered sugar . The rice puddings are ready, just serve them .

Rice puddings can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 or 5 days in a well-sealed airtight container.
If you want to freeze the rice puddings, it is advisable to freeze them raw, then bake them in the same way, without thawing them first; if necessary, extend the baking time by about 5 minutes.
If you don't have a muffin mold, you can prepare the rice puddings in disposable aluminum cups.
