To prepare Venus rice with prawn tails, start by cleaning the prawns: remove the heads , tails (keep only six prawns with the tail), and shells (for more details, see the How to clean shrimp ). Set aside the prawn carcasses because they will be the base of your fish stock (for more details on how to prepare crustacean broth, see the Shellfish Stock ).
Cook the Venus rice in plenty of boiling salted water and let it cook for at least 20 minutes, or according to the instructions on the rice package . Finely chop the dill, chives , and shallot. Sauté the shallot with extra virgin olive oil in a large pan over low heat for a few minutes .
When the shallot is golden, add the prawns, let them brown for a few minutes , and deglaze with a bit of water .  Mix the tomato paste with the tomato pulp and
add it to the prawns . Deglaze everything with the crustacean broth , mix and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of dill and 1 tablespoon of chives . Now let the sauce cook until it is thick but not too dry.
Drain the Venus rice al dente and toss it in the pan with the sauce for five minutes . Your Venus rice with prawn tails is ready; sprinkle with the chopped dill and chives , then serve.
Venus rice with prawn tails can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day, in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
If you want a spicier and hotter rice, you can avoid adding the tomato, dill, and chives, and prepare the Venus rice with prawn tails with a pinch of paprika or curry.
Venus rice, very aromatic, with a flavor similar to freshly toasted hazelnuts, was originally cultivated in China and was considered forbidden due to its presumed aphrodisiac capabilities and thus reserved only for the palates of emperors; today, it is grown in the Po Valley and is easily available in all major supermarkets.
