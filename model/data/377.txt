instructions:
To prepare zucchini rolls, first trim the zucchini . Then use a vegetable peeler to cut very thin slices lengthwise . Place oil and rustic breadcrumbs in two separate plates .
Join two zucchini slices and dip them first in the oil and then coat both sides with breadcrumbs .
Fill them with fontina and cured ham . Gently roll them up to avoid losing the coating .
Once all the rolls are made , arrange them in a baking dish so they support each other . Bake in a static oven at 392°F for 15 minutes. Your zucchini rolls are ready to be served
Zucchini rolls should be consumed as soon as they are ready, but if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator in a sealed container for 1 day.
The fontina slices should not be too thick, otherwise, you will have difficulty rolling the zucchini. For a vegetarian version, replace the cured ham with chunks of taleggio or gorgonzola.
