This 5-minute cake from Emilia-Romagna, up in northern Italy, is your ticket to something sweet without any hassle. Known as "Torta sinc minut," it’s really popular around here. Traditionally, folks mixed it by hand, but now a mixer works too. Really, it’s super moist and tender, and it’s all about keeping things simple and quick. This quick cake recipe is just what you need for a snack when you do not want a big cleanup. I mean, the sweet aroma in your kitchen? That’s half the fun, as locals would say.
Now, locals love this easy cake recipe for breakfast or a chill afternoon break. Really, they might have it with coffee, dip it in milk, or share it with family—especially on a lazy Sunday. And here’s the thing: unlike a microwave cake or a mug cake , this one stays soft and moist for days. Which is great. Families sometimes add orange zest or a splash of vanilla for a more fragrant touch. Even the basic version is a big hit.

To make the 5-minute cake, preheat the static oven to 356°F, then take a food processor and add all the ingredients: the sifted flour , granulated sugar , whole blanched almonds
the butter cut into pieces , the 3 whole eggs , baking powder for cakes
A pinch of salt , grate the lemon zest to scent the dough and flavor it with Grand Marnier. Blend everything until you get a homogeneous mixture; the dough should be quite compact. Butter and line with parchment paper a 9-inch cake pan, pour the mixture inside with a spoon
Spread the mixture evenly in the pan and level the surface with a spatula . Bake the cake in the preheated oven at 356°F for 50 minutes (you can try baking in a convection oven at 320°F for about 40 minutes, covering if necessary the surface with aluminum foil for the last 10 minutes and always perform the toothpick test). Once the baking time is over, remove the pan from the oven , let it cool slightly, then unmold and serve the 5-minute cake dusted with powdered sugar !
You can store the 5-minute cake under a glass dome for 2-3 days. It is possible to freeze the cooked cake.
If you don't like almonds, you can replace them with hazelnuts, pistachios, or walnuts.
