Caramelle fritte con crema pasticcera e frutti di bosco is one of those Italian desserts that really, really calls your name from across the table. It’s true. These sweet little fried pastries get their name because they look like wrapped candies—with their ends twisted up. Inside, there’s a creamy and sweet vanilla custard filling that oozes out just a bit when you bite into the crispy, golden shell. And people from all over Italy know how good this combo can be—fried dough, custard filling , and a handful of tangy mixed berries like blueberries or raspberries.
It’s the kind of thing that feels fancy, but the flavors are straight-up comforting and a little bit nostalgic, especially if you grew up around traditional Italian sweets. A dusting of powdered sugar on top makes these little bites look extra tempting and gives that extra touch of sweetness with every bite. Super tasty.
In some parts of Italy, people get creative with whatever berries are in season, so you might see these with blackberries or strawberries, too. What makes caramelle fritte different from other deep-fried desserts is the contrast—how the moist, smooth custard meets the crispy outside, plus the burst of fresh fruit that cuts through all the richness. Which is great.
It's kind of a playful spin on classic homemade pastries , and it shows just how much Italians love mixing different flavors and textures in their sweet treats . I gotta say, whether you’re into easy dessert recipes or just want a reason to treat yourself, this dish works for family gatherings, parties, or a casual night in.
The best part? Even though they look impressive, they come together pretty quickly and bring a taste of Italian celebration right to your table. Once you try these, you’ll understand why so many people love these fun little fried pastries —it’s a real "vero peccato di gola." Seriously good. It’s the kind of thing that makes any day feel special. So next time you're in the mood for something delicious and a bit adventurous, give these a go and enjoy a little slice of Italy right at home.
To prepare the custard, take the vanilla bean, cut it with a small knife, and scrape out the seeds . Add the seeds and the vanilla pod to milk and cream placed on the stove (you can also replace 50 g of cream with the same amount of milk) (alternatively, you can also flavor with the zest of an orange or lemon). Turn on the heat and when the mixture is about to boil, turn off the heat and let the vanilla infuse for at least 5 minutes. Meanwhile, continue the preparation by separating the egg whites from the yolks; collect the latter in a large bowl and add the sugar (with the leftover egg whites you can make a delicious Angel Cake, meringues, or cat's tongues). Beat the egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer or a whisk to obtain a homogeneous cream.
When they are white and frothy, add the sifted cornstarch or rice starch and mix it with the rest of the mixture; Remove the vanilla bean from the heated milk and cream and add the egg mixture . Turn the heat back on and stir continuously with a whisk to thicken the mixture .
When the custard is thick, turn off the heat and pour it into a wide and shallow bowl ; immediately cover it with cling film in contact to prevent the annoying film from forming; then let it cool first at room temperature and then in the refrigerator. Take the pastry discs
and with the help of a disposable piping bag without a nozzle, fill each disc with a central tuft of cream (about 1 oz) ; place a blueberry or a raspberry (or other berries of your choice), you can make half the discs one way and the other half the other (11-12).
Then roll the disc onto itself to form a cylinder , then pinch the edges near the filling to create a shape similar to a candy , making sure to seal the content well. Once the candies are ready
you can fry them in plenty of vegetable oil brought to a temperature of 338-356°F maximum (checked with a kitchen thermometer); fry a few candies at a time for just a few moments until golden; then place them on a tray lined with paper towels . Serve the fried candies with custard and berries still warm, dusted with powdered sugar!
It is recommended to consume the candies immediately after frying.
Once filled, they can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours before frying.
Freezing is not recommended.

You can add dark chocolate chips to the filling.
If you prefer, you can use shortcrust pastry to prepare the candies, cutting the discs with a pastry cutter of about 4 inches.
