Eggplant tacos, huh? They are a super fun twist on the classic Mexican taco, with a little Italian flair. Really tasty. Instead of tortillas, these eggplant tacos use slices of tender fried eggplant. Yeah, they're folded in half and stuffed with melty mozzarella, salty prosciutto, and some rich tomato sauce. You get that gooey cheese pull, plus a bit of crispy on the edges. Honestly, it feels hearty but still light. Great for taco night—or a party. No question.
Thing is, people all over Italy, from Naples to Sicily, come up with different spins on eggplant dishes—this one just looks like tacos and tastes like it’s straight from an Italian trattoria. Whether you call them vegetarian tacos or just a new way to eat eggplant, they really get everyone talking. And look, it's all about keeping it easy and crowd-friendly.
In Italian kitchens, you’ll see folks serving these vegan tacos as appetizers at gatherings. And you know what? They work as a snack or a side. Or, make a big batch and it is the main dish. The combo of eggplant, tomato, and mozzarella is a hit with kids and grown-ups. There's just something about that warm, stretchy cheese—so so pleasing. Plus, they fit into all sorts of diets; swap the prosciutto for more veggies and boom— plant-based tacos for everyone.
And listen, if you want to shake things up, try grilled or roasted versions using those same eggplant slices. Or add a bit of spice to turn them into spicy eggplant tacos —for an extra kick. And these golden half-moons? Seriously, they disappear fast. Especially when folks spot that cheesy filling. However you serve them, these tacos really show how Italian and Mexican flavors can blend into one seriously good snack. They’re a perfect example of culinary creativity—two worlds on one plate. For real. Can't go wrong.

For a lighter version, you can grill the eggplants instead of frying them!
If the mozzarella is very watery, we recommend draining the excess liquid in a colander.
