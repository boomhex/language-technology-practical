instructions:
To prepare rizzuole with ragù, béchamel, and peas, start by making the dough by sifting the flour and pouring it into a stand mixer with a dough hook . Also add the sugar and dry yeast to the mixer.
Start the mixer on low speed. While working the dough, add the room temperature water gradually and the salt . Gradually add the lard as well to ensure it is well absorbed by the dough , continuing to knead.
When the dough is hooked to the dough hook , transfer it to a work surface . Then knead it by hand into a spherical shape and place it in a bowl . Let it rise for 4 hours at a temperature of 82-86°F, making sure to cover it with a blanket or clean cloth, or alternatively in a turned-off oven with the light on.
At this point, start preparing the ragù by making the How to make the soffritto . Rinse the carrots and celery under cold running water, then finely chop them along with the onion. Heat the oil in a non-stick pan, add the onion , carrots , and chopped celery , then stir with a spatula or wooden spoon.
Then add the ground meat . Take the sausage, remove the casing , and slightly mash it with a fork . Transfer the sausage to a small bowl.
Add it to the pan with the rest of the meat and let it cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes, continuing to stir with a spatula or wooden spoon for even cooking. Deglaze with the white wine and let it evaporate. In a separate small bowl, dissolve the tomato paste with a little water .
Then add the tomato paste to the meat , continuing to stir. Season the ragù with salt and pepper and add the bay leaves ; let it cook covered for about 30 minutes over low heat. After the necessary time, add the peas and let them cook for another 10 minutes.
Once cooked, remove the bay leaves from the ragù with kitchen tongs , then transfer it to a dish to cool at room temperature . Once cooled, move the ragù to the refrigerator, as it needs to be very cold for filling the rizzuole. Now prepare the Béchamel sauce sauce that will be mixed with the ragù. Pour the milk into a saucepan and heat it .
In another saucepan, melt the butter over low heat, turn off the heat, and add the sifted flour . Stir with a hand whisk to make the mixture smooth. Put it back on low heat until the mixture turns golden. Flavor the milk with a grating of nutmeg and a pinch of salt. Then add it to the butter and flour mixture, continuing to stir with the whisk to avoid lumps. Cook for about 5-6 minutes to thicken until it starts to boil. Transfer it to a dish and cover it with cling film in contact to prevent a crust from forming. Let it cool at room temperature. Once cooled, place it in the refrigerator.
After the necessary time, take the dough and shape it into a large loaf . Cut it into 13 pieces weighing 65 g each and shape each into a ball with your hands . Once ready, place the balls on a tray lined with parchment paper and let them rise for about 1 hour at a temperature of 82-86°F or in a turned-off oven with the light on.
After the rising time, take the balls and flatten them slightly with your fingers into a disk shape . Set one ball aside and with it create a small loaf. With a dough scraper, cut small pieces of dough about 3/4 inch long and shape them into small balls. At this point, mix the now cold ragù and béchamel in a bowl and blend them well.
Now fill the rizzuole: place a spoonful of the now cold ragù mixed with béchamel in the center of the disk . Close the dough with the filling by bringing the edges together and applying slight pressure with your fingertips to seal it better . Proceed by closing the other edges, thus giving it a pouch shape .
With your hands, then give your pouch a spherical shape. Repeat the operation for all the remaining dough balls. Then place the stuffed pouches on a tray lined with parchment paper. Now take a small bowl and crack an egg into it. Brush the top of the rizzuole with the egg to place the small ball you prepared earlier. Dip the rizzuole in the egg and then roll them in breadcrumbs , ensuring it adheres evenly.
Finally, take a pot and heat the oil. When it reaches a temperature of 338°F (you can check with a kitchen thermometer), use a slotted spoon to immerse 3-4 rizzuole until they are golden. Turn them occasionally to ensure even cooking. Once ready, transfer them to a tray with paper towels to drain the excess oil . Your rizzuole with ragù, béchamel, and peas are ready to be enjoyed while still hot !
Rizzuole with ragù, béchamel, and peas can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. Before serving, reheat them slightly.
They can be frozen once cooked if only fresh ingredients have been used.
The ragù can be stored in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to 2-3 days.
It is possible to freeze the ragù if only fresh ingredients have been used.
Perfect rizzuole? Make sure the ragù is very cold and compact to prevent the filling from coming out during cooking! Also, if you don't like tomato paste, don't worry! You can use regular tomatoes, adding some potato starch or cornstarch until you get a compact consistency that will prevent unpleasant ragù leaks during cooking.
