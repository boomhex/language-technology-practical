instructions:
To prepare the red truffles, first chop the dark chocolate , melt it in a double boiler , and let it cool slightly.
Meanwhile, cut the sponge cake into cubes and transfer it to a bowl. Pour the melted chocolate into the bowl with the sponge cake and start mixing with a spatula, then knead with your hands .
Add the whole raspberries, which you will have previously washed and dried , and continue kneading to obtain a compact mixture. Form balls weighing about 0.7 oz each: with these quantities, you will get about 26 . Place the balls on a tray lined with parchment paper and transfer them to the refrigerator.
Now chop the white chocolate and melt it in a double boiler , then pour it into a bowl .
Add the food coloring to the white chocolate until you obtain a nice red color, then blend with an immersion blender to make the mixture smooth and shiny . Take the balls out of the refrigerator and dip 2-3 balls at a time into the mixture , turning them to cover them evenly.
Drain the balls with the appropriate tool or with the help of a fork and place them back on the tray with parchment paper . Use the end of a teaspoon handle to make decorations with the red chocolate , then refrigerate for 1-2 hours. Once dried, serve your red truffles in paper cups !
The red truffles can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. You can freeze them without the white chocolate coating.
If you prefer, you can replace the fresh raspberries with strawberry jam to get a more compact mixture!
