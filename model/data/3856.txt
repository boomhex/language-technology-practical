instructions:
To prepare Fettuccine alla Papalina, first cut the prosciutto into slices and then into strips . Place a non-stick pan over the heat and melt the butter cut into pieces .
Let the finely chopped onion soften in the butter for 8 minutes by adding a ladle of water at room temperature . Add the previously sliced prosciutto strips and
mix with a kitchen spatula , cooking for another 2 minutes. Once ready, turn off the heat and set aside. Put a pot with salted water on the heat and bring to a boil, then cook the fettuccine al dente for 3 minutes ; meanwhile, crack the eggs into a bowl and add the cream, mixing vigorously with a whisk .
Add the grated cheese , mix again , and finally adjust the salt .
After the necessary time, drain the fettuccine and pour them directly into the pan with the sauce , tossing for a few moments to flavor; turn off the heat and add the egg-based mixture , distributing it evenly over the pasta .
Mix quickly to combine all the ingredients well , then season with pepper : your Fettuccine alla Papalina are ready to be served piping hot .
It is recommended to consume the fettuccine immediately while hot. Freezing is not advised.
If you want to prepare homemade fettuccine (for 4-5 people), you should mix 300 g (10.5 oz) of flour with 3 eggs, a drizzle of oil, and a pinch of salt: you should obtain a homogeneous and slightly porous dough, which you will let rest for half an hour. After the necessary time, you can roll out a not-too-thin sheet that you will roll up and cut into strips about 1 cm (3/8 inch) wide.
