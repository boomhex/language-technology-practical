instructions:
To make panna cotta , first soak the gelatin sheets in cold water for 10-15 minutes . Cut the vanilla pod lengthwise and extract the seeds by scraping with the tip of a knife . Put the liquid cream in a saucepan, then pour in the sugar .
Flavor with the vanilla seeds and also add the pod ; heat everything over a low heat, but without boiling; when it comes to a boil, turn off the heat and extract the pod using kitchen tongs .
When the gelatin is softened, drain it without squeezing excessively , then dip it in the pot with hot cream . Stir with a wooden spoon or hand whisk until the gelatin has completely dissolved; there must be no lumps. At this point take 4 five-ounce molds and pour in the panna cotta using a ladle .
Once the molds are filled , put the panna cotta in the refrigerator to set for at least 5 hours. Once it has set , before serving it and for better demolding, dip each mold into boiling water for a few seconds .
then immediately demold the panna cotta on each serving plate : serve your panna cotta au natural , with caramel, melted chocolate, or fruit coulis .
The panna cotta can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days at most, well covered with plastic wrap, or in an airtight container.
If you prefer, you can also freeze the panna cotta once it has set. To defrost it, just leave it in the fridge the night before.
To flavor the panna cotta you can also use the seeds of the vanilla pod or, if you prefer citrus notes, you can also add lemon peel.
According to the most ancient Piedmontese tradition, the panna cotta should be cooled in molds lined with caramelized sugar to give more flavor to the dessert.
