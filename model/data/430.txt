instructions:
To prepare the stracciatella in vegetable broth, first, prepare the broth. Wash the vegetables thoroughly and peel the carrots . Then cut them into chunks and do the same with the celery .
Slice the leek, removing the root part , and separate the onion layers . In a pot, pour about 2 liters of cold water and add the vegetables .
Add the cloves , salt , and tomato paste .
Cook over medium heat for about 40 minutes . After this time , strain the broth .
Pour it back into the pot and keep it warm. Meanwhile, in a bowl, pour the eggs and add the Parmesan cheese .
Grate some nutmeg inside and mix with a whisk. Pour the egg mixture thinly into the boiling broth, stirring with the whisk .
Continue to stir until the eggs are well scrambled . Cook for 5 minutes , then serve, add a dash of pepper, and serve .
We recommend serving the stracciatella freshly made. The broth can be stored in the fridge for 1-2 days, but we suggest adding the egg mixture to the hot broth only when serving.
The vegetables used to make the broth can be blended to prepare a vegetable cream or as a base for a velouté. Alternatively, you can dress them with oil and eat them as a side dish. If you're short on time, discover how to make Vegetable stock in the microwave !
