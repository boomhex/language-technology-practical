Sicilian mafalde bread is like a warm hug from southern Italy. You know, this bread is a staple in Sicily, especially down south. Really, you'll see it everywhere—on tables, in bakery windows, pretty much all over. The first thing? Its thick, crispy crust, sprinkled generously with golden sesame seeds. Seriously good, giving you a nutty bite each time you tear off a piece. And inside, it's perfectly soft and tender—just what you want from homemade bread. Families in Sicily totally treasure this bread. It's common to hear stories about how the Sicilian mafalde recipe is passed down from grandmothers to grandkids, which is great. This tradition makes the bread really special, no question. There's this sense of pride in serving it fresh, whether it’s to complete a meal or as a snack with sweet hazelnut cream or mild cheese.
Every bakery has its unique spin on mafalde. And the thing is, you can always count on that thick crust and sesame seeds on top. Some Sicilians might use black sesame seeds or add a bit more olive oil to the dough, kinda based on family tradition. This bread isn't just for sandwiches—it’s perfect for scooping up sauce from classic Sicilian pasta dishes . But or just eating on its own while still warm from the oven. I mean, it is fascinating how something so simple becomes the highlight of the table, especially when paired with dishes like mafaldine pasta with fennel or homemade mafaldine tossed in olive oil. In Sicily, bread like this is about more than just eating. It symbolizes sharing, history, and, you know, the joy of gathering with family and friends. Once you try a real Sicilian mafalde recipe , you'll see why bread is really, really important in Sicilian homes. The taste is just comforting—bringing a bit of southern Italian sunshine into your day with every bite. Can't go wrong.
To prepare Sicilian mafalde, start with the preparation of the starter. In a bowl, combine the semolina flour, yeast , and while kneading by hand, pour in the lukewarm water . Cover the freshly mixed dough with plastic wrap and let it rise in the oven turned off for at least 3 hours with the light on, thus allowing a constant temperature of about 86°F, ideal for rising .
Then take the starter and pour it into a mixer with a dough hook along with the remilled semolina and the dried yeast , turn on the machine while pouring the lukewarm water slowly . When the dough has come together, meaning it has literally clung to the hook, you can add the salt and knead for another 3-4 minutes.
Finish the dough by working it on a pastry board . If you like, you can also give it a reinforcing fold by simply overlapping the edges of the two ends by bringing them toward the center, then one on top of the other. Round the dough (i.e., form a round shape with your hands) into a sphere , place it in a container, cover again with plastic wrap, and let it rise for 2-3 hours, still in the oven turned off with the light on. After that, transfer the risen dough to the pastry board
and form a loaf dividing it into 6 parts of about 3 oz each . At this point, you should continue to roll each piece of dough with the palms of your hands
to obtain a cord about 24 inches long with the same thickness . With the loaf, form a sort of serpentine . At the end of this little serpent, pull the right edge, bringing it along the entire serpentine to divide it in half . Continue this way for all the other pieces of dough, trying to be quick and covering the dough pieces left to work and the ready mafalde with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out.
Once the mafalde are made, brush the surface with water , then roll them in sesame seeds . As you go, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper
and let them rise for an hour . Meanwhile, bring a small pot of water to a boil and place it at the bottom of the oven and bake your mafalde in a preheated oven at 446°F for 20 minutes. Remove the pot and lower to 392°F, baking for another 10 minutes . When cooked, let them cool. At this point, all that's left is to break apart a still-warm Sicilian mafalda and enjoy it !
The Sicilian mafalda can be stored in a paper bag for up to 1 day. You can freeze the mafalde raw, before the last rise, or after they are cooked, placing them in freezer bags.
You can also prepare the starter the night before; just let it rest in the oven turned off with the light on for 1 hour and then store it, covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator for 10-12 hours. The next day, just let the dough acclimate for an hour before continuing.
