Mint cake makes a splash in Morocco by transforming the beloved green tea with mint into a fun, fluffy treat. Instead of sipping that fresh, soothing drink, you get the same flavors in a dessert that's like an easy mint cake . Really good stuff. People whip up homemade mint syrup for this, which gives the cake a really moist, soft bite and a light green color that looks cool on the table. And look, the mint cake recipe captures all the good vibes of Moroccan tea time, letting you enjoy that fresh minty taste in every bite. Some folks even pair it with a cup of white hot chocolate with mint. Which is great. It’s not your usual dessert, but it’s a fun way to try something new that’s perfect for relaxing moments or when you just want a snack that feels special.
Fans of mint chocolate cake or chocolate mint cake will love this twist. While it doesn’t always have chocolate, you can add some to create a mint chocolate chip cake or go for a peppermint chocolate cake vibe. Some families turn it into a mint layer cake with cream or mint frosting in between, especially for celebrations. Really, the cake’s tender, light crumb pairs well with tea or coffee, and the homemade mint syrup really really makes it different from boxed mixes or store-bought options.
Thing is, a lot of the fun comes from experimenting—adding chocolate chips, a drizzle of simple glaze, or even using it as a base for a chocolate mint dessert. For real, it’s a cool way to blend Moroccan and European traditions in one snack, inspiring you to try more flavor combos from around the world. And, you know, the next time you’re in the mood for something sweet and a little different, this homemade mint cake brings a fresh new twist to dessert time. Pretty simple. It makes a great addition to any occasion.
To make the mint cake, start by preparing the mint syrup the day before as follows: put the mint leaves , granulated sugar , and blend everything well in a mixer. Pour the water into a small pot
and add the mint and sugar mix . Heat everything over medium heat and remove from the heat only when it starts to boil . Transfer the mint syrup into a jar and once it is lukewarm, store it in the fridge, letting it steep overnight. The next day, take the syrup, strain it with a fine mesh sieve to remove the minced mint residues, and set it aside in a bowl.
You can proceed with the cake preparation: in a bowl, place the butter in pieces and the sugar , beat the mixture with electric whisks and work it until it becomes frothy. Add the eggs one at a time , continuing to work with the whisks, and mix everything well.
Then pour in the milk and 7.75 oz of previously prepared mint syrup ; then, continuing to work the dough with the whisks, add the flour ,
the cornstarch and the baking powder until you get a homogeneous mixture . Butter a 9.5-inch diameter cake pan and pour the mixture into it .
At this point bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 40 minutes. Once cooked, remove the mint cake from the oven and, once it has cooled, remove it from the mold and dust it with powdered sugar before serving it .
The mint cake can be stored for 1-2 days under a glass dome.
To make this cake even more delicious, you can glaze it with dark chocolate glaze. The mint and chocolate combination will surely be a winning choice for your palate!
