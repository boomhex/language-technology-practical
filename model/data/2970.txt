instructions:
Pissaladière is a French onion tart that really, really grabs your attention. It's got a mix of tender onions, salty anchovies, and those little golden bursts from the olives. Really good stuff. It hails straight from the sunny streets of Nice in the South of France, bringing together all those Mediterranean ingredients we love. And you know what? The name actually comes from “pissalat,” an old-school fish paste—though nowadays it’s the anchovies that steal the show. You get these layers of slow-cooked, almost sweet onions, fresh thyme, and bay leaf, which just work perfectly with the strong, tangy pop of anchovies. And the olives? Don’t skip them—locals swear by their caillettes or the small, wrinkly taggiasche. These little gems give every bite a bit of extra Mediterranean flair, making the whole thing a real standout when it comes to savory tart snacks.
Not quite a pizza, not quite a focaccia—it's kinda in its own league. People in Provence love to share it as a traditional French appetizer . Super common to cut it up and pass it around with a glass of cold white wine. Which is great. Especially when you’re chilling by the sea or at a picnic. The soft, almost moist base soaks up all those herby onion juices, and you get this amazing mix of crispy edges and chewy middle bits. So, so good. The flavor is all about the balance between sweet onions and salty toppings. No question, that’s what makes the anchovy and olive tart famous in Niçoise cuisine. If you’re into regional food, you might notice it’s got some things in common with the Italian sardenaira or even a Puglian onion calzone, but it’s totally its own thing. The vibe here is easy, generous, and full of those big Provençal flavors—perfect for when you want something a bit different but still comforting. Whether served as an appetizer or a finger food , pissaladière is a tasty nod to the rich culinary traditions of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region.
To prepare the pissaladière, start by making the bread dough for the base. Some variations of this recipe involve the use of Puff pastry or Easy Shortcrust Pastry , if you don't have time for leavening, you can try one of these alternatives. Sift the flour into the bowl of a stand mixer or a large bowl if you are working by hand . Then pour a splash of water, taken from the total amount, into a small bowl and dissolve the salt in it (2-3).
Then dissolve the malt (or sugar) in the remaining water , the dehydrated brewer's yeast (or alternatively 8g of fresh yeast) and add the extra virgin olive oil .
Add the water, malt, yeast, and oil solution to the flour and start kneading at medium speed using the paddle attachment on the stand mixer or with your hands to gather the ingredients. After 1 minute, also add the water with the salt while continuing to knead . When all the ingredients are gathered around the paddle, replace it with the dough hook and continue kneading at medium-low speed for at least 5 minutes, until the mixture is smooth and homogeneous.
Work the dough with your hands, giving it a spherical shape , pour a drizzle of oil into a bowl and brush it with a brush . Then place the dough in, cover it with plastic wrap and let it rise for at least 2 hours at room temperature (around 82-86°F), until it doubles in volume.
Now focus on desalinizing the salted anchovies, which are headless: place the anchovies in a bowl and rinse them repeatedly under cold water to remove the salt . Drain them with a colander and leave them to soak in cold water for 2-3 hours, frequently changing the water. Perform this operation very gently to avoid the anchovies breaking apart.
When the anchovies have softened, open them in half and remove the insides with the central bone . Then line a small tray or baking sheet with absorbent paper and place the opened fillets on it . In the end, you will get about 150g of desalted anchovies.
At this point, prepare the topping for the pissaladière: clean the onions, removing the stalk and peel the outermost layer with the skin . Then cut them in half and slice thinly .
Place the thyme and bay leaves on a cutting board, chop finely , and set aside. Then heat the oil in a non-stick pan and, once hot, add the sliced onions . Also, add 2 crushed garlic cloves using a garlic press or the prongs of a fork .
Season the onions with the thyme and bay leaf mixture and the sugar , pepper to taste. Cover with a lid and let cook on low heat for about 30 minutes, until the onions become translucent. The onions should not color, so if necessary, deglaze with a few tablespoons of hot water.
When the onions are almost done cooking, place the capers, already drained and squeezed, on a cutting board along with about 50g of the total amount of salted anchovies that you have desalted and cleaned. Chop and, after turning off the heat, add the chopped mixture to the onions . Mix well to combine the ingredients and let cool in the pan .
While the pissaladière topping cools, grease a baking tray measuring 14x10 inches, using your hands or a brush . Take the dough, which will have risen in the meantime, and transfer it to the oiled tray , then press it with your fingertips from the center to the sides, until it covers the entire surface .
Now pour the topping over the dough you have spread and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon , remembering to leave a ¾ inch border. Start decorating the pissaladière with the remaining anchovy fillets: create diamonds by arranging the anchovies diagonally .
Continue forming the diamonds starting from the opposite corner to where you started, completing the grid . Place the black olives in the spaces between one strip and the other and bake in a preheated static oven, on a hot baking sheet, at 428°F for about 25 minutes. When the edges are golden and crispy , the pissaladière will be ready to be served as an appetizer, perhaps accompanied by a good chilled white wine!
Store the pissaladière in the fridge well covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container for a maximum of 2 days. Reheat it in the oven before consuming.
Pissaladière is a specialty born in Nice but widespread throughout the South of France up to the Ligurian Riviera, where it is known by various names including Pizzalandrea, Pissadella, sardinaria because, instead of anchovies, the cheaper sardines were used. The Italian version includes the presence of tomato sauce, absolutely not provided in the Nice pissaladière, and the use of different aromatic herbs such as marjoram.
Purists should search for caillettes olives, those delicious, small black fruits typical of the countryside around Nice. As an alternative, we suggest Taggiasca olives (salted just enough to be perfect in this context) or black olives from your area: a local touch certainly does no harm! As for the anchovies, maximum attention must be paid to the desalting phase: if you don't want an overly salty flatbread, it's better to soften them a little, don't you think?
