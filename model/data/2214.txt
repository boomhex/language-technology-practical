To prepare the pappardelle with venison ragù, start with the marinade. Gently wash the venison pieces under running water and transfer them to a large bowl . At this point, add all the spices and aromas for the marinade (fennel, juniper, sage, bay leaf, rosemary, garlic, onion, and cloves), then pour the red wine , ensuring all the meat is well covered by the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator for about 20 hours.
After this time, drain the meat from the marinade and grind it with the appropriate tool . If you don't have a meat grinder, you can finely chop the venison with a knife. Now focus on the sauté: peel the carrot, celery, and onion, then finely chop them
and transfer them to a pot where you have poured the indicated amount of oil . Turn on the heat and let the mixture wilt; only then can you add the ground meat . Over high heat, brown this as well, stirring often, and when it has completely changed color, deglaze with the red wine .
Once it has completely evaporated, add the tomato puree and let everything cook, covered with a lid, for about 4 and a half hours over low heat, stirring occasionally. Once the ragù is ready , cook the pasta in plenty of boiling water , salted to taste.
Drain the pappardelle al dente and transfer them to the ragù . Sauté everything for a minute and serve your pappardelle with venison ragù still steaming !
Pappardelle with venison ragù can be stored for a maximum of one day in the refrigerator, in an airtight container. As for the ragù alone, the same storage method applies, but it can last up to 2-3 days. If you used all fresh ingredients, you can also freeze it.
Prepare the ragù the day before; once rested, the flavors will have completely blended and it will be even better!
