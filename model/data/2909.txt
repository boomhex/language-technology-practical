Frittatine di salmone al timo e taccole is one of those Italian dishes that's just, I gotta say, fresh and fun from the first bite. You know, these mini salmon frittata treats mix rich Norwegian salmon with some good local Italian stuff like tender snow peas (taccole), a handful of thyme , and creamy provola cheese. The result? A bite that's both moist and a bit crispy around the edges. It's got this mild, herby kick that really really makes it pop. In southern Italy, folks love to play around with what's inside their frittate—pretty much using whatever seasonal veggies are best—so this version sticks to that tradition with a nice balance of flavors. And here's the thing: baking these instead of frying keeps them lighter, which totally fits into what people expect from healthy frittata recipes and Mediterranean food in general.
One of the best things about these frittatine is how versatile they are. Hosting friends? Seriously good. Make them in fun shapes for an appetizer spread that's as tasty as it looks. Need a quick weeknight meal? Just pair them with a simple salad or tuck them into a sandwich for a twist. Plus, the baked frittata is super easy to customize, so you can switch up the cheese or toss in extra veggies if you’ve got them. The snow peas add a little sweet crunch that goes perfectly with the golden top you get from oven-baking. And look, they also fit the bill for easy salmon recipes when you want something special but don’t want to spend forever in the kitchen. People who care about high-protein meals or gluten-free frittata ideas will totally appreciate how these fit into all sorts of diets. Every bite is like a little party—perfect for those who enjoy food that's playful, tasty, and has that touch of Italian flair without being too fancy. The use of fresh, local ingredients means you’re not just eating well, but really embracing the spirit of Italian cooking, which is all about simplicity and flavor. Whether you're a frittata fan or just new to these great bites, this dish offers a delicious way to dive into Italian culinary traditions.
To prepare the salmon fritters with thyme and snow peas, start by preparing the snow peas: trim both ends with a small knife , then rinse them under running water and place them in a large saucepan: fill it with water until the snow peas are covered.
Then add salt and bring to a boil. It will take about 10 minutes for the snow peas to soften but not disintegrate. Then drain them and leave them in the colander to cool and drain the cooking water .
When they are cool, cut them into small squares . Then cut the provolone into cubes ; remove any bones from the salmon fillet using tweezers, then cut it into strips about 0.4 inches thick and reduce them to cubes. Set all these preparations aside.
Now start whisking the eggs with a whisk , then add the pepper, salt to taste, and 2 tablespoons of room temperature milk . Also add the thyme leaves and mix .
Add the snow peas , the provolone cubes , and the salmon cubes, leaving 1/3 aside to add before baking the fritters . Mix everything to combine the ingredients.
Then brush the bottom of the fritter molds with a little butter and line with parchment paper. Pour the mixture until it is 0.4 inches from the edge of each mold . Add the previously set aside salmon cubes and bake in a static oven at 356°F for about 15-20 minutes (if using a convection oven, bake at 320°F for 10-15 minutes). Remove the salmon fritters with thyme and snow peas from the oven , let them cool slightly, and then unmold before serving!
You can store the salmon, thyme, and snow pea fritters in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for up to 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of provolone, you can use fontina or any soft cheese you prefer. You can replace thyme with other spices.
