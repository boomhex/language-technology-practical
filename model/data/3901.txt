Heat the oil and 1.5 tbsp of butter in a saucepan, and add the pork ribs (or loin) previously tied, studded with sage and cloves, and floured (if the meat is compact enough, you may not need to tie it). Brown it well on all sides, then salt, pepper, and cover it with milk, cooking it for about 50 minutes on low heat, turning it occasionally. Turn on the oven grill 15 minutes before the end of the meat's cooking. Once cooked, let the pork ribs drain on a rack, then spread it with honey and roll it in brown sugar, allowing the latter to adhere evenly to the meat. Place the pork ribs in the oven for half an hour under a very hot grill; position the meat on a rack, placed on a tray to collect the juice that will drip from the roast during cooking; during this phase, turn the meat frequently. Meanwhile, with the cooking base of the meat cooked in milk, prepare a sauce by thickening it by mixing it with a piece of butter, a level teaspoon of flour, and adjusting it with salt (if the cooking base turns out to be too thick, add a little milk to make it more fluid). If the base is lumpy, put it in the blender for a few minutes, and you will get a smooth cream. At this point, clean the pineapple, cut it into pieces removing the woody central part, and sauté it in a pan with 1.5 tbsp of butter; do the same with the corn previously drained of its water. Combine the two sides. After half an hour, take the pork ribs out of the oven, slice it, and arrange it on a serving plate, accompanied by the pineapple and corn, and drizzle it with the previously prepared sauce.
If you don't like the sweet-and-sour taste very much, or want to make it less pronounced, reduce the amount of honey and brown sugar. If you wish, you can replace the pork ribs with veal eye round or turkey roast. If you want to avoid smoke and excessive odors during oven cooking, pour a glass or two of water into the pan placed under the roast.
Pineapple, with its particular sour taste, pairs very well with pork.
