instructions:
To prepare the baked white rice, first pour the rice into boiling salted water and cook it for 3-4 minutes less than the time indicated on the package, as it will finish cooking in the oven . In the meantime, cook the peas: in a small saucepan, place 1.5 tbsp of butter and turn the heat to low.
Add the peas , stir, and cook for about 5 minutes . Finally, season with salt and set aside.
Drain the rice al dente and stir in the remaining 13 tbsp of butter , the milk , and 1/3 cup of grated Parmigiano Reggiano .
Mix well . Then cut the scamorza cheese into small pieces. Transfer the rice to a large bowl .
Add the egg , diced ham , and almost all the scamorza cheese , leaving some cubes aside for the top.
Also add the peas and mix everything together . Transfer the mixture to a 13x9 inch baking dish and smooth the surface .
Place the reserved scamorza pieces on top and the remaining 2 tbsp of Parmigiano . Bake in a static oven, preheated to 428°F, in grill mode for 15-20 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve your baked white rice!
You can store baked white rice in the refrigerator for 2-3 days in an airtight container.
You can freeze it already portioned if you used all fresh ingredients.
Instead of scamorza, you can use other cheeses like mozzarella or caciocavallo.
You can replace cooked ham with salami cubes. For a more pronounced gratin, you can brush the surface with a drizzle of melted butter.
