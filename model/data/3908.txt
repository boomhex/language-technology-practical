To prepare the ricotta triangles, start with the dough: place the flour, the butter (cold) cut into pieces, and the ricotta on a work surface and knead the ingredients well to obtain a smooth and elastic dough . If during this process the mixture sticks to the work surface, sprinkle it several times with flour until the dough is elastic and dry. At this point, wrap the dough in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for at least half an hour.
Meanwhile, prepare the fillings: cut the Gruyere into flakes and the Prague ham into strips ; then peel the pears, remove the core, and cut them into small pieces , remove the crust from the taleggio and cut it into cubes. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and with the help of a rolling pin, roll out the dough into a rectangle shape with a thickness of about 1/16 inch. Using a fluted pastry cutter, cut the dough into squares with sides of about 4 inches .
and place the previously prepared fillings in the center of them as follows: on one square of dough, place pieces of taleggio and a teaspoon of chopped pear; on another square of dough place the Prague ham strips and the Gruyere flakes . Beat an egg in a small bowl and with a brush, brush the edges of the dough squares , before folding them diagonally to form triangles . Once closed, place the triangles on baking sheets lined with parchment paper and brush their surface with the beaten egg, then bake them for 20-25 minutes at 355°F. Once cooked, place the triangles on a serving plate and serve immediately!
If you cut the dough into squares with sides of about 4 inches, you will get about 16 fairly large triangles, and as a portion for an appetizer, 2 pieces per person will be enough: if you reduce the side of the squares to about 3 inches, you will get about 20, and you can serve even 3 per person.
The pastry in this preparation is neutral, so its filling can be either sweet or savory. If you want an idea on how to prepare a simple and delicious treat for your children's snack, go to the recipe for Ricotta triangles with cherry jam !
