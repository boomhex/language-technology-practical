instructions:
To prepare the savory pie with cherry tomatoes and scamorza, first slice both the scamorza and the cherry tomatoes . Place the puff pastry with its parchment paper in a 9.5-inch diameter pan .
Prick the bottom with a fork so it won't puff up during baking . Sprinkle the base with breadcrumbs , then add the scamorza .
Distribute the cherry tomatoes , then season with oil , salt, pepper, and oregano .
Fold the edges of the puff pastry inwards and brush with beaten egg . Bake in a static oven at 400°F for 25-30 minutes, until the pastry is golden and crispy. Finally, garnish with a few basil leaves. Your savory pie with cherry tomatoes and scamorza is ready to be enjoyed !
The savory pie with cherry tomatoes and scamorza can be stored in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container, for about 2 days.
You can substitute the scamorza with well-drained mozzarella, provola, or other stringy cheeses.
If you prefer a stronger flavor, try adding some slices of caramelized red onion or black olives!
