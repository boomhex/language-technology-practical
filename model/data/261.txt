instructions:
To prepare the passatelli with prosciutto in meat broth, first make the meat broth following our recipe. In the meantime, prepare the passatelli: take 4 slices of prosciutto from the total and set them aside, then finely chop the rest . In a bowl, pour the breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan , and eggs .
Add the chopped prosciutto , season with salt and pepper, then knead until you obtain a homogeneous mixture . If the dough is too soft, add a bit more breadcrumbs; if it's too dry, moisten it with a few tablespoons of cold broth. Let the dough rest for 15-20 minutes at room temperature.
Meanwhile, place the reserved slices of prosciutto in a hot non-stick pan and cook over medium heat for 3-4 minutes per side until crispy. Transfer the crispy prosciutto to absorbent paper and bring the broth back to a boil. Place the dough into the appropriate tool (alternatively, you can use a potato ricer with large holes) and press it directly into the boiling broth, cutting the passatelli with a knife blade to a length of about 1.5 inches . Cook for 2-3 minutes or until they float to the surface.
Plate the dish and top with coarsely chopped crispy prosciutto . Your passatelli with prosciutto in meat broth are ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the passatelli with prosciutto in meat broth as soon as they are ready; if there are leftovers, you can store them with the broth in the refrigerator for one day in an airtight container.
The passatelli dough can be stored in the refrigerator, well wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 12 hours.
The meat broth can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator in a closed container for 2-3 days or frozen in portions for 2 months.
If you wish, at the time of plating, you can add a sprinkle of grated Parmesan.
