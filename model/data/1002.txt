instructions:
To prepare the zucchini and shrimp rolls, first clean the crustaceans: remove the head and take off the shell with the legs, leaving only the tail . Cut along the back and extract the black vein with a toothpick .
Move on to the zucchini: wash it and cut off the ends, then cut 12 very thin slices using a mandoline . Finally, chop the parsley which will be used both for the flavored oil and the breading .
Pour the oil into a small bowl, add a teaspoon of chopped parsley and mix , then brush the shrimp with the flavored oil , salt , and pepper.
To make the breading, pour the breadcrumbs into a bowl, add 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley and the grated lemon zest , salt and mix .
Now you can assemble the rolls: lay a slice of zucchini on a plate, place a shrimp at the lower end and roll everything up to the other end , then coat the obtained roll with the aromatic breadcrumbs and place it on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Continue in the same way with the rest of the ingredients.
When all the rolls are ready, drizzle with a little oil and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 12 minutes. Once ready , serve your zucchini and shrimp rolls immediately !
It is advisable to consume the zucchini and shrimp rolls immediately; alternatively, you can store them in the refrigerator for a maximum of one day. Freezing is not recommended.
You can vary the breading flavors by using mint or thyme instead of parsley or adding coriander or curry for an ethnic note!
