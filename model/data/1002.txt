Penne in a boat —honestly, it’s something special—hails from the gorgeous Island of Elba, just off Tuscany’s coast in Italy. This dish, a local favorite since the 1960s, has that unique flair you do not see every day.
So here's the thing, rather than just tossing penne with seafood and olive oil, this recipe blends a creamy béchamel sauce with egg yolks. And listen, this makes the pasta rich and velvety—way, way better than your typical spaghetti alle vongole. Every piece of pasta gets drenched in sauce, making each bite so moist and flavorful, you won’t believe it.
While Tuscany is famous for its seafood, it’s really the sauce that sets this dish apart from others like Caciucco alla livornese. With its deep history and local pride, penne in barca is a true Elban tradition. Kinda fancy but, you know, perfect for a weeknight meal.
Some folks on Elba love preparing this as a baked penne in foil or as a one-tray pasta bake . It’s like magic—the pasta gets those golden edges and the sauce becomes extra tender and comforting. Perfect for a family-friendly pasta that's special but not too tough. Seriously good. Unlike other quick penne dishes, this one feels more indulgent—thanks to that creamy sauce.
For real, many cooks throw in fresh vegetables or shrimp for extra flavor. It’s kinda like a penne with vegetables or seafood dish. Plus, it's so easy to whip up, folks call it a foil packet pasta —ideal for when you want something impressive, but it’s really pretty simple.
Penne in a boat keeps that special Elban touch. With every tangy forkful, it gives you a little slice of Tuscany, which is great.

To make the Penne on a Boat, first, take care of cleaning the clams: make sure there are no broken or empty shells, as they should be discarded. Then proceed to tap them against the sink or on a cutting board. This operation is important to check that there's no sand inside: healthy bivalves will remain closed, while sandy ones will open. Let the clams purge: in a large bowl, pour coarse salt and the clams , cover with water and let them soak for a couple of hours.
In the meantime, prepare the béchamel sauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan , and in another, heat the milk and add a pinch of salt. Once the butter has melted, add the flour all at once and stir with a whisk.
Once the roux is obtained, add the milk and cook for a few minutes, stirring constantly, until you achieve a smooth and homogeneous consistency . Keep the béchamel sauce at room temperature covered with plastic wrap .
Now chop the parsley and set it aside: it will be used for the sauce. Clean and finely chop the onion , the half clove of garlic with the germ removed, and the chili pepper .
Separate the egg yolks from the whites, season with salt, and beat them lightly . Sauté the chopped onion, garlic, and chili pepper in a pan with oil , for just a couple of minutes over medium-high heat, until they soften .
Add the clams , deglaze with white wine , and cover with a lid . Cook until all the shells are open. Meanwhile, place a pot filled with salted water on the stove and bring it to a boil.
Cook the pasta and drain it 3-4 minutes before the end of the cooking time directly into the pan with the clams . Finish cooking in the pan for 4-5 minutes; the pasta should absorb almost all the juice released by the clams and start to have the right creaminess. With the heat off, with the pan still very hot, add the béchamel sauce .
Finally, add the parsley and yolks , mix to combine, and serve your Penne on a Boat hot .
It is recommended to consume the Penne on a Boat immediately.
Freezing is not recommended.
