Panzerotti ripieni di verdure e scamorza is seriously tasty and hails straight from Southern Italy. It's especially loved in places like Puglia and Campania . These vegetable stuffed panzerotti take those classic fried dough pockets and give them a fresh twist. Really good stuff. Filled with a colorful mix of zucchini, green beans, and carrots, each bite gives you a burst of color and flavor. And the cheese? It's all about the sweet, stringy scamorza—melts beautifully—making the filling super soft and gooey. Unlike heavier, meat-filled versions, this recipe focuses on lightness and freshness. Still delivers that satisfying crunch from the crispy, golden exterior. For sure.
In Southern Italy, panzerotti with scamorza are such a hit at parties and street food stands. Perfect for buffets, you know? You can just pick them up and eat them right out of the fryer. Pretty simple. The combination of tender vegetables and moist cheese wrapped in that puffy, slightly chewy dough is just hard to resist. Honestly, the smell as they fry is so enticing—you'll wanna dive right in. The homemade panzerotti dough gives an authentic touch, bringing that true taste of Italian street food to your table.
Everyone has their own spin—some add different veggies or a hint of spice—but the core stays the same: a crispy shell with a cheesy, colorful filling. Really captures the heart of Southern Italy. Serve them as an appetizer or with drinks, and look, you've got a party on a plate. Whether you're hosting a gathering or just craving a taste of Italy, these panzerotti are a super super delicious way to bring the Mediterranean to your table.
To prepare the panzerotti filled with vegetables and scamorza, wash the vegetables under plenty of fresh running water. Trim the zucchini , slice them , and then dice into 1/6 inch .
Repeat the same operation for the carrots , finally slice and then dice the scamorza as well . Trim the green beans and blanch them for 5 minutes in plenty of salted water ,
then drain them and cut into 1/6 inch pieces . Place a large non-stick pot on the stove with the oil ; when the oil is hot, add the diced carrots, cooking for 2 minutes, then add the zucchini and cook for another 2 minutes .
Add the green beans , seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. When the vegetables are ready, turn off the heat and transfer them to a bowl to cool. Then add the scamorza previously diced and mix with a spoon .
Take the dough discs one at a time and fill them with about 1 oz of vegetable and cheese filling ; brush the edges with a bit of water
and close them by overlapping the edges to create a half-moon ; seal the edges well with your fingers , then trim them with a 4-inch diameter fluted pastry cutter .
In a large pot, heat the oil, when the oil reaches a temperature of 347°-356°F (you can check with a kitchen thermometer) fry the panzerotti 2-3 at a time until they are golden and crispy. Remove them from excess oil with a slotted spoon and let them dry on absorbent paper . Serve your vegetable and scamorza panzerotti hot immediately !
It is recommended to consume the panzerotti filled with vegetables and scamorza immediately while hot; freezing is not recommended.
