instructions:
To prepare the buckwheat plumcake with chocolate chips, start by placing eggs and sugar in a bowl and whisking them with an electric mixer until you have a light and frothy mixture .
Add oil and milk , stirring everything either with a hand whisk. Fold in the flour into the mixture
and the sifted baking powder . With a hand whisk or a spoon, mix all the ingredients until you have a lump-free batter (8-9).
Line the inside of a plumcake mold with baking paper, pour the batter , then add the chocolate chips on top . Stir the chips into the batter with a spoon ,
so they sink in . Bake the plumcake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 35 minutes. Once cooked, take it out and let it cool before serving .
You can keep the plumcake well wrapped in plastic wrap for 3-4 days.
It is possible to add dried fruits like walnuts or chopped hazelnuts to the plumcake batter, in addition to the chocolate chips.
