Agretti, also called monk’s beard or barba di frate in Italy, is a springtime treat you’ll find in markets across Central Italy. These bright green, spaghetti-thin veggies kinda look like chives, but they pack a more tangy and slightly bitter punch. Really good stuff.
If you're scratching your head about how to clean agretti , don't worry—it is pretty simple. And start by trimming off the roots and the tougher base parts. After that, a good rinse is crucial since agretti can hold a surprising amount of dirt, especially between those tender, fleshy shoots. Wrap them in a paper towel and pop them in your fridge.

The mild, crisp bite adds something special to dishes that spinach or chard just can’t match.

Salsola soda, the plant from which agretti comes, has a unique taste that really stands out in classic Italian spring cooking.
