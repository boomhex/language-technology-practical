instructions:
To prepare your nocino, start by thoroughly washing the fresh walnuts . Then, if possible, wear gloves, as they tend to stain hands during subsequent processing. Cut the walnuts in half .
Place them in a large glass jar and add the spices: cinnamon and cloves .
Add the lemon peel, which you should have taken with a peeler to avoid taking the white part, which would be bitter . Pour the alcohol to cover and close the jar .
Let it macerate in full sunlight for 40 days, making sure to shake it every day to mix it. After 40 days , filter it into a pitcher , removing the walnuts and keeping aside only the alcohol, which will have absorbed all the flavors .
Prepare the syrup: put the water and sugar in a saucepan . As soon as they reach a boil and the sugar is completely dissolved, turn off the heat . Pour the syrup into the pitcher with the alcoholic part .
Mix well and with the help of a funnel, transfer it into a bottle . Keep it this way for 3-4 months before enjoying it .
Nocino can be stored at room temperature or in the refrigerator.
If you prefer, you can replace cinnamon and cloves with perhaps juniper or star anise.
