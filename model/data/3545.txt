To prepare the biscuits with Parmesan and Pecorino, start by pouring the flour into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a flat beater . Add both types of cheese , cold cubed butter, pepper, and salt .
Run the mixer at medium speed, add the cold milk slowly , and let it mix until a rather compact dough forms (if you don't have a stand mixer, you can easily make this dough by hand). Transfer the dough onto a work surface (preferably cold) and work it just enough to form a flattened block .
Wrap it with plastic wrap, and let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes . After this time, retrieve the block and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface, to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Using a cookie cutter of your desired shape, form your biscuits now ; with these quantities and 2.5-inch diameter cutters, you will get about 14!
Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and sprinkle a bit of Parmesan in the center of each biscuit . Finish with a grind of black pepper , and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 15 minutes (if you want to bake in a convection oven, you can try baking one or two biscuits to test the times and temperature for the rest). Take your biscuits with Parmesan and Pecorino out of the oven, let them cool and… enjoy them !
You can store your biscuits in a tin box for up to 7 days. You can also freeze the raw dough and thaw it when needed!
A refined touch for your biscuits? Add oregano to the dough and embellish the surface with a generous grind of pink pepper!
