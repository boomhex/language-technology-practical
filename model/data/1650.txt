instructions:
To prepare the peach bread, start by preheating the oven to 356°F, then wash the peaches under running water , dry them, and cut them into fairly large pieces : you will need 10 oz of peach pulp. Carefully weigh all the ingredients and pour them into the mixer: first, add the peach wedges ,
the sugar , the flour , the whole eggs ,
the baking powder , flavor with lemon zest , and finally add the liquids: the seed oil
and the milk . Turn on the blades and blend everything until you get a creamy mixture . Butter and flour a 9-inch diameter cake pan and pour the mixture inside .
The batter is ready for baking , bake in a preheated oven at 356°F for 60 minutes. Once baked, remove the peach bread from the oven and let it cool slightly before slicing it .
Store the peach bread under a glass dome for 2-3 days. You can freeze the peach bread after baking, perhaps already sliced to defrost only the needed portion when required.
Accompany the peach bread with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it will be summer instantly!
