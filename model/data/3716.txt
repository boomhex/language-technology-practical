To prepare baked stuffed peaches, start by rinsing and drying the peaches. Cut each peach in half , then use a small knife to remove the pit . Scoop out a little of the flesh around the pit's hollow . Set the peaches aside.
Now, focus on the filling: chop the flesh removed from the peaches and mince it with a knife or alternatively using a food processor. Set aside. Take the chocolate and finely chop it .
Transfer it to a bowl and set it aside . Take another bowl and coarsely crumble the amaretti inside . If you prefer, you can also finely chop them with a food processor. Add the crumbled amaretti to the peach flesh .
Mix the ingredients with a fork. Then also add the chocolate and combine it with the ingredients. Finally, place the peaches in a lightly buttered baking dish close to each other with the hollow facing up, preferably without leaving gaps. Fill them with a few tablespoons of the filling, shaping it into a small dome .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 60 minutes (or in a convection oven at 320°F for 50 minutes) . Once the time is up, remove the stuffed peaches from the oven and serve them to your guests while still warm !
Baked stuffed peaches can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 2-3 days.
They can also be frozen once cooked. Before serving, thaw them in the refrigerator for a couple of hours and then warm them in the oven.
Accompany the stuffed peaches with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream! For those with a sweet tooth, you can also flavor the filling with a few drops of rum.
Baked stuffed peaches are called “persi pijen” in Piedmontese, meaning stuffed peaches, and are used as a typical summer dessert, especially during summer patronal festivals.
