Stroncatura calabrese is this really rustic pasta from Calabria, in southern Italy, where bold, honest flavors pretty much rule.

The anchovies melt into hot olive oil, giving the dish a deep, salty kick that blends perfectly with the sweet and juicy cherry tomatoes . And listen, adding in some olives—especially those slightly bitter Taggiasca ones—creates a mix of salty, briny and a bit tangy all at once. What really makes this dish shine is the golden pangrattato, or toasted breadcrumbs, sprinkled on top. This adds a crispy contrast that complements the Mediterranean vibe and those classic Calabrian flavors.
