instructions:
To prepare the mezze penne with red pesto and arugula, first bring a pot of salted water to a boil to cook the pasta. In the meantime, prepare the pesto: combine the sun-dried tomatoes in oil , the hazelnuts , and the basil in a food processor.
Add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano and the oil . Blend for a few moments, then add a ladle of water and blend again for a few seconds until you obtain a smooth consistency .
Transfer the pesto obtained to a pan and cook the pasta in the boiling water . Drain the pasta al dente directly into the pan with the pesto and toss briefly to combine.
Off the heat, add the arugula and a little more grated cheese . Your mezze penne with red pesto and arugula are ready to be served !
The mezze penne with red pesto and arugula can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days, in an airtight container.
If you prepare the pasta with red pesto in advance, we recommend adding the arugula only at the last moment.
If you wish, you can replace the hazelnuts with a mix of almonds and pine nuts.
