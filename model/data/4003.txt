instructions:
To prepare pasta with mushrooms and speck, start by cleaning the champignons. First, remove the root part, which is more earthy, with a knife . Then clean the entire mushroom with a damp cloth . It's important not to wash it under water. At this point, slice the champignons .
In a large pan, pour a drizzle of oil and a clove of garlic ; turn on the heat and let it infuse, then add the mushrooms . Add salt and pepper and cook for a few minutes. Meanwhile, put a pot of salted water on the stove to boil for cooking the pasta.
When the mushrooms' water has evaporated, deglaze with white wine and cook for a few more minutes. Meanwhile, cut the speck into strips and place it in a small pan .
Toast it on medium heat until it becomes crispy , then set it aside . As soon as the water boils, cook the paccheri .
Drain them al dente and transfer them to the pan with the mushrooms ; add a ladle of cooking water and the stracchino .
Sauté well until you achieve a creamy result. If necessary, add another ladle of cooking water. Finish with chopped parsley and about half of the speck . Plate and decorate with the remaining speck .
We recommend serving the pasta immediately; otherwise, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day.
Instead of speck, you can use pancetta or guanciale. Instead of champignon mushrooms, you can use your preferred variety or a mix.
