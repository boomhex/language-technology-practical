To prepare the crispy salmon on cannellini cream, start by deboning the salmon fillet: use a pair of tweezers to remove the bones along the back; once this operation is done, feel the flesh to ensure all bones have been removed. Then make the butterfly cut: cut the fillet into 4 slices about three fingers wide and cut halfway through each slice, without cutting completely ; finally, open the salmon slices like a book , place them on a plate, and set aside. This cut can also be done if you have a salmon fillet with skin.
Now prepare the aromatic herbs that you will use to cover your salmon butterflies: finely chop a bunch of parsley , 2 sprigs of thyme , and 2 sprigs of dill .
Place a mixture of shelled pistachios in a baking dish and add the chopped herbs and breadcrumbs , then salt and pepper to taste; in this way, you have prepared the coating. Next, crack an egg, remove the yolk, and slightly beat the egg white .
Brush the entire surface of each salmon butterfly with the egg white , then lay them in the baking dish with the coating and turn them over from both sides until they are completely covered (11-12). Place the coated salmon butterflies on a tray and set aside.
Focus on the cannellini cream: take a large pot and heat a peeled garlic clove and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil , then add the sage and rosemary, let it fry for a few minutes (if you want, you can remove the garlic after flavoring the oil), then add the cannellini beans previously soaked and boiled .
Pour in a couple of ladles of vegetable broth , season with salt and pepper, and let it cook for a few minutes until the beans are creamy and dry. To learn how to prepare it best, check out our Cooking School: Vegetable broth . At this point, remove the pot from the heat and blend the mixture with an immersion blender directly in the pot until you obtain a smooth and dense cream .
Now cook the salmon butterflies: heat a grill or a large pan well, this is an important step because it only takes a few minutes of cooking over high heat to keep the meat tender, alternatively, you can cook the salmon on lower heat being careful not to dry the meat too much. You can alternatively cook in a pan with a drizzle of oil. Cook on both sides over moderate heat until the outside is colored (19-20) and the inside remains juicy. All you have to do is plate: make a bed of cannellini cream on the serving plate and lay the salmon butterfly on top, finish with a sprig of dill, a sprinkle of thyme, and a drizzle of raw oil . Serve your crispy salmon on cannellini cream and enjoy it hot!
You can store the cannellini cream in the fridge well covered with cling film or in an airtight container for a couple of days. It is recommended to consume the crispy salmon immediately.
Create the coating according to your taste: replace the pistachios with almonds or hazelnuts and flavor it with grated lemon or orange zest. Or try the recipe for Crispy Salmon with Panko , a delicious fusion variant!
