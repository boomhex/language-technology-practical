instructions:
To make pleurotus cutlets on the grill, start by cleaning the mushrooms: use a damp cloth to clean the surface of the caps and the stem to remove any dirt , then use a small knife to separate the stems from the cluster (2-3), and if necessary, wipe the caps and the inner gills with the cloth to remove any traces of soil. Set aside the individual whole caps for cooking.
Now prepare the breading: in a bowl, place the two whole eggs, add salt , pepper and beat them with a fork . In two separate bowls, sift the flour
and the breadcrumbs . Now that everything is ready , you can start assembling the cutlets: take a single cap, flour it ,
then dip it in the egg and finally coat it with breadcrumbs . Once you have breaded the pleurotus, place a large-bottomed pot on the stove and heat the seed oil. For perfect frying, the ideal temperature should be between 338°F and 356°F. To monitor the temperature, use a food thermometer. When the oil is hot, immerse the mushrooms and cook them for a few minutes until golden brown,
Once cooked, drain the pleurotus with a slotted spoon and place them on a tray lined with absorbent paper to remove excess oil . Alternatively, you can bake the pleurotus in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 15-20 minutes. Your pleurotus cutlets are ready to be enjoyed hot !
It is recommended to consume pleurotus cutlets immediately. If there are leftovers, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
