Glazed pork loin —it’s a real showstopper. Honestly, in Italy, this dish stands out with its clever blend of flavors. And look, what makes this version so unique is the way the sweet-and-sour honey and orange glaze just clings to the pork rack. It gives you a crispy crust that's both a little sweet and a tad tangy. The smells while roasting? Seriously good.
And here's the thing, the pork comes out so so tender and juicy. Apples aren’t just there for looks—they turn soft and caramelized as they cook, soaking up meat juices, adding a perfect contrast to the pork's richer taste. Pretty much a classic for Sunday lunch or big family gatherings, especially in northern Italian homes where mixing fruit with meat feels both homey and fancy.
In Italy, you’ll find this glazed pork loin at holiday dinners. Everyone has their twist, really. Some folks might add extra spices or a splash of wine to the glaze, but it’s the honey glazed pork and apples combo that really really makes it sing.
You serve it up, and those golden slices of pork with their sticky glaze—wow. Plus, the side of moist apples almost melts when you cut into them. It’s the kind of dish that always gets people talking, with its perfect balance of sweet and savory. Pair it with roasted potatoes or just some simple bread, and you’ve got something that’s both easygoing and a bit fancy at the same time.

To prepare the glazed pork rack with apples, start by cleaning the ribs. Use a knife to remove the meat between the protruding bones (1-2). Once this operation is complete, set aside the small pieces that remain. Place the oil and meat in a large pot .
Add the rosemary sprigs and brown the meat over medium heat for a few minutes, turning it on both sides until it has browned ; season with salt and pepper to taste. Meanwhile, roughly chop the celery stalk, onion, carrot, and the small pieces of meat you set aside earlier . Add the chopped vegetables and meat to the rack and let it brown briefly .
Cover the meat with vegetable broth (find the Vegetable broth recipe here) and continue cooking with a lid ; cook the meat for about 1 hour. Meanwhile, prepare the glaze: squeeze an orange ;
In a saucepan, heat the honey over low heat for a few minutes until it becomes liquid. Add the orange juice, straining it with a sieve , stir well with a wooden spatula, and add a teaspoon of cinnamon and one of paprika . When the glaze has thickened, turn off the heat and set it aside.
When the meat is cooked, transfer it to a large baking dish; wash the apples well and arrange them whole in the baking dish, side by side around the rack. Add a small portion of the cooking juices to moisten the meat and use a kitchen brush to spread the honey and spice glaze evenly over the meat . Place the rack in a preheated static oven at 464°F for 15 minutes until it is well browned .
Glaze the meat again and cook it in the oven again at 464°F for 15 minutes; repeat the same operation a third time: this way the rack will become slightly crispy. When the roast and apples have acquired a nice golden color, the glazed pork rack is ready. Finally, blend the remaining cooking juices with the vegetables and serve it with the glazed pork rack with apples .
You can store the glazed pork rack with apples in the fridge for up to 3 days, covered with plastic wrap, and heat it before serving. You can freeze the cooked rack only if you used fresh, not previously frozen meat. When ready to use, you can thaw it in the refrigerator the night before and then heat it before serving.
