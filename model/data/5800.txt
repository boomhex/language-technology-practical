To make chocolate chip muffins, leave the butter out of the fridge for at least 1 hour to soften. Combine the softened butter with sugar , and beat with an electric mixer until you achieve a fluffy and creamy mixture . Then, split a vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds using the back of a knife .
Pour these into the bowl with the butter and sugar . Start the mixer again and add the eggs, also at room temperature, one at a time , to prevent the ingredients from separating .
Now sift the flour , the baking powder , and the baking soda directly into the bowl with the mixture.
Also add a pinch of salt and activate the mixer again to incorporate the dry ingredients . You'll notice the batter becomes thicker, so thin it out with room temperature milk added gradually . At this point, the mixture will be soft and compact .
Combine 80 g (about 3 oz) of chocolate chips and gently mix them in using a spatula. Then, transfer the batter into a disposable piping bag without a tip for a cleaner process, or you can simply use a spoon if preferred. Place paper liners in a muffin tray and fill each one about 2/3 full, leaving just under a centimeter from the top . Each muffin should weigh approximately 70 g (about 2.5 oz).
On the muffins, sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips , and bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (180°C) for 18-20 minutes in static mode . At this point, your chocolate chip muffins are ready to be enjoyed .
Chocolate chip muffins can be stored for a maximum of 2-3 days under a glass cloche. If you prefer, you can freeze the baked muffins, then let them thaw as needed and warm them slightly in the oven before serving.
You can make them more rustic by chopping up a chocolate bar into flakes instead of using chocolate chips. If you also add cubed pears, you'll create a delicious chocolate and pear variation! It's essential to use the freshest ingredients and ensure that milk, eggs, and butter are always at room temperature.
