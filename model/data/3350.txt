Schiacciate con porchetta e provolone is a snack that really brings the flavors of Lazio to life. And look, this isn’t your average sandwich; it’s got that porchetta and provolone vibe that’s just unbeatable. Porchetta di Ariccia —it's famous around Rome—has this crispy, herb-packed skin and tender slices that are just bursting with flavor. Really good stuff. The schiacciata? Like a Tuscan flatbread, but here, it’s the perfect base for that juicy pork. Add some thick provolone cheese slices, and you’ve got something melty, strong, and just a bit tangy. This combo really shows off what folks in Lazio do best: simple food made with top-notch ingredients, served in a way that's casual yet really really tasty.
Bite into one of these schiacciata with porchetta and you get a bit of everything—crunchy crust, moist pork, and gooey cheese. Pretty much a flavor bomb. It’s the kind of thing people grab at street food stalls, local bars, or while hanging out with friends. You’ll notice that porchetta from Ariccia is not your average roast pork; it’s rolled up with garlic, rosemary, and wild fennel, giving it this strong, aromatic kick. And you know, it pairs so well with the smooth, mild flavor of provolone.
While some regions make their flatbread a bit thicker or add different toppings, Lazio keeps it simple and focuses on those powerful flavors. For real, this is the perfect Italian flatbread recipe for anyone who loves a little crunch, a little melt, and a whole lot of taste. Whether you’re serving it up as an easy Italian appetizer or just making yourself a killer lunch, it’s the kind of food that’s tough to stop eating—it’s just that squisito and that irresistibile. Grab a slice and you’ll see why this traditional Italian sandwich is such a hit in Lazio and beyond. It’s not just a meal; it’s a celebration of local culture and flavor that keeps people coming back for more. Seriously good.
Start by preparing the aromatic oil: pour the extra virgin olive oil into a saucepan and lightly warm it, remove from heat and add a clove of garlic cut in half , finely chopped rosemary with a knife, and fennel seeds that you have slightly crushed with the blade of a knife to release their aroma . Pepper generously and let the oil rest and infuse for at least 2 hours.
Then remove the crust from the provolone and cut it into regular cubes approximately 1/2 inch on each side. Perform the same operation with the 2 slices of porchetta . Cover each “La Bottega di Olivia&Marino” flatbread with cubes of porchetta and cubes of provolone . Finally, add some lamb's lettuce leaves, dress with a few drops of aromatic oil and serve the appetizers!
