Then turn them over and continue cooking on the other side . Transfer the grilled zucchini to a platter and set them aside for a moment. Transfer the robiola to a bowl and mash it slightly with a fork .
Season with salt, pepper , and chopped chives . Lay the zucchini on a cutting board and spread the entire surface with the cheese .
Add a slice of prosciutto , roll up , and serve your zucchini rolls with prosciutto and robiola .
We recommend consuming the zucchini rolls with prosciutto and robiola immediately, but if you wish, you can store them, sealed in an airtight container and kept in the refrigerator, for up to one day.
You can use chives like string to tie the rolls into a little package.
