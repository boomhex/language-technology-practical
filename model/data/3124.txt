Risotto con pasta di salame e Bonarda is a real treasure from Lombardy . Really, it showcases the amazing flavors of the Oltrepò Pavese region. And here's the deal: the magic comes from fresh salami paste, packed with pork and whole peppercorns. It’s like traditional sausage but way way better. Locals love their regional salami, but if you can't find it, just grab some good fresh sausage. It'll work great.
First off, start with a soffritto of onion. It turns a lovely golden color. Then you toast the rice and brown the salami. And look, the Bonarda wine gives this red wine risotto its distinct shade and tangy richness. Everything comes together with meat broth in about twenty minutes—feels like it’s been simmering for hours, which is great.
This risotto ends up creamy and has this unexpected kick from the salami. Each bite is both moist and packed with flavor. Can't go wrong. It's comfort food with a twist—Lombardy style—and perfect for sharing with family. Plus, a bottle of Bonarda on the table? For sure.
The risotto with salami really captures the lively spirit of an Italian gathering. It’s simple yet wonderfully over-the-top. Pair it with a glass of Bonarda to enhance the meal, highlighting those tender bits of meat and the wine's subtle warmth. If you’re after an easy risotto recipe that bursts with regional character, this one has it all. It's quick to prepare, rich in flavor, and perfect for any evening when you want something special without much fuss. Pretty much.
To prepare the risotto with salami paste and Bonarda, finely chop a red onion and sauté it in a large pot with a couple of tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil . Add a ladle of meat broth and stew for about 5 minutes, until it becomes soft . At this point, add the salami paste ,
break it up with the help of a spoon and cook it until it becomes golden. Then toast the rice for about 5 minutes over high heat , deglaze with the Bonarda, and immediately after lower the flame intensity .
Continue cooking the rice, adding a ladle of broth at a time , only after the previous one has been absorbed by the rice, stirring constantly. Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from the heat and stir in butter, grated Parmigiano, and fresh parsley . Your risotto with salami paste and Bonarda is ready : you'll taste how good it is!
You can store the risotto in the refrigerator in an airtight container for a couple of days. Freezing is not recommended.
Bonarda is a wine made from a black grape variety, found both in Piedmont, where Bonarda Piemontese is produced, and in Lombardy. The name Bonarda seems to derive from two Lombard terms Bono and Hard, meaning strong and courageous. The Bonarda produced in the Oltrepò Pavese is actually made with croatina grapes: croatina comes from the dialect term "croatta," meaning tie, indicating that the wine produced with this grape was drunk on holidays, precisely when wearing a tie.
The salami paste, a true delight, is native to the Oltrepò Pavese and, alas, almost impossible to find outside Lombardy. While waiting for producers to organize to export this delicacy worldwide, if you live in other regions, I recommend replacing it with one of the typical sausages from your area: you will discover a new way to express a local flavor!
