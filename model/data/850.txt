instructions:
To prepare the cavatelli, first boil the potatoes starting from cold water until they are soft enough to be easily pierced with a fork ; it will take 30-40 minutes, depending on the size. Mix the flour with the semolina , then mash the potatoes into the bowl ; the skin will remain inside the potato masher.
Add the room temperature water and mix the mixture with your hands , then transfer to the work surface and continue to knead to obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough .
Use a dough scraper to divide the dough into smaller portions , lightly flour the work surface and roll them out with your fingertips to form ropes about 0.5 inches thick . Cut the ropes into pieces no longer than 0.75 inches .
With your thumb, press each piece on the cut side and drag it on the work surface from bottom to top to create the classic concave shape . Place them one by one on a lightly floured cloth, and the potato cavatelli are ready to be cooked and dressed as you like !
Once ready, you can choose whether to cook the cavatelli immediately or dry or freeze them.
If you decide to dry them, leave them overnight on a floured cloth, spaced apart; the time may vary depending on the humidity in the room. You can store them for a month in a jar or bag.
If you choose to freeze them, spread the cavatelli on a tray and place them in the freezer for about half an hour before transferring them to a bag without the risk; this way they will not stick together.
Fresh cavatelli should be cooked in boiling salted water and can be drained as soon as they float. On the other hand, dried or frozen cavatelli will need a few more minutes of cooking!
