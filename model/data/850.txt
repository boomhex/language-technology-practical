So, Neapolitan zeppole. Seriously, these are a huge deal in Campania, especially around Naples. You know, this part of Southern Italy? Every March, for Father’s Day, people get super excited about making Neapolitan zeppole . Really, it’s the one dessert you just gotta have on the table. Plus, the double cooking method—yeah, it stands out. First, you bake the dough, then fry it until it’s golden and crispy outside but stays light and airy inside. This trick, for real, it’s a source of pride because you get Italian fried dough that’s not heavy or greasy. Pretty cool.
Now, the classic version has pastry cream and those sweet-tart sour cherries, amarene. But hey, folks mix it up with mascarpone cream or Nutella. In Naples, pastry shops love their own spins—maybe cocoa dough or using an air fryer for something lighter. Whatever the twist, this zeppole recipe keeps that taste of tradition and celebration going.
And here’s the thing, on St. Joseph’s Day, the smell of these moist pastries fills the streets. Some families go for the old-school zeppole di San Giuseppe stuffed with silky custard, while others are into the soft, coffee-flavored, or gluten-free versions that are so popular now. Thing is, what makes these pastries fun is how each bakery in Naples tries to outdo the others. They’re all about getting that perfect crunch outside and almost melt-in-your-mouth inside. Oh, and powdered sugar on top? Essential. Makes them stand out from other traditional Italian desserts .
Whether you call them choux pastry fritters, Italian doughnuts, or just zeppole, these fried pastries with powdered sugar are about sharing good food with those you care about. At the end of the day, it’s the old recipes, regional pride, and that super tender bite that make Neapolitan zeppole something folks look forward to every year. Really, really good.

To prepare Neapolitan zeppole, first prepare the Pastry cream ; you will need about 2 cups of it. Now prepare the dough. Pour the water into a pot and add the salt . Add the butter and stir continuously until it is melted . It should almost reach boiling point.
Add all the flour at once , lower the heat to the minimum, and stir with a wooden spoon for about 5 minutes. When the dough detaches well from the walls and a patina forms on the bottom, you can turn off the heat and transfer it to a bowl. While the dough is still warm, add one egg .
Stir with a wooden spoon to absorb it , then continue this way, adding one egg at a time and stirring until you get a creamy yet firm mixture . You may need to add an extra egg if the eggs are very small, so adjust according to the consistency.
Now transfer the dough into a piping bag with a 0.6-inch star nozzle . Grease a baking sheet and create the zeppole within it using the piping bag. Make two circles, trying to achieve a diameter of 4 inches, and ensure the zeppole are well spaced, as they will grow while baking . Bake the zeppole in a preheated static oven at 392°F until they have grown; it will take about 15-18 minutes. Meanwhile, pour plenty of oil into a saucepan and heat it to reach a temperature of 356°F. Then remove the zeppole from the oven .
Fry them immediately in the hot oil to prevent them from deflating . Turn them over often using the handles of two wooden spoons, and after about 2 minutes, when they are golden, you can drain them . We recommend cooking 2 or 4 zeppole at a time if you have a large enough pan. Then drain the zeppole with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a tray with absorbent paper to remove excess oil.
As soon as the zeppole are cold, sprinkle them with powdered sugar , add plenty of custard in the center , and garnish with syrupy cherries .
We recommend consuming the zeppole within 1-2 days at most.
For baking, it is preferable to grease the baking sheet rather than using parchment paper. This way, the zeppole will rise better.
