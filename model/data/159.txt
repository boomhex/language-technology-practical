To prepare the steamed cod fillet with tomatoes and caper berries, first cut the cherry tomatoes into 4 parts , then distribute them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Season with salt and oil and bake in a preheated fan oven at 356°F for 40 minutes.
In the meantime, cut the cod fillet into 3.5 oz portions . Salt the water in the steamer , place the basket on top , and bring to a boil.
Place the cod portions in the basket , cover with the lid , and steam for 7 minutes. After this time, remove the cod from the steamer and gently pat it dry with a paper towel to remove excess water. Meanwhile, cut the caper berries in half .
When the tomatoes are cooked , transfer half of them into a jug and blend with an immersion blender to obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream .
