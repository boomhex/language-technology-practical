instructions:
To prepare the Christmas savory pie, first blanch the spinach , drain them well , then place them in a mixer and add the ricotta .
Season with salt and blend until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture . Remove the rind from the brie and cut it into pieces .
Lay one sheet of puff pastry, with its parchment paper, on a baking tray. Place the ricotta and spinach cream in the center and spread it over the surface, leaving a 0.6-inch border. Arrange the bacon and the brie on the filling.
Cover with the second sheet of puff pastry and mark the center with a small bowl. Cut out 4 wedges, following an imaginary cross, then divide them in half to make 8 , and divide them again in half to make 16. Take two wedges and twist them twice outwards .
Seal the ends together and secure them with a toothpick . Repeat the same procedure until you have 8 points. Place a glass in the center, without pressing too much, and make a design of your choice inside the circle. Brush with the egg yolk and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or for 10 minutes in the freezer. Cook in a preheated oven, static function, on the middle rack, at 375°F for about 25 minutes. Your Christmas savory pie is ready to be served .
The Christmas savory pie can be stored in the refrigerator, well covered with plastic wrap or inside a closed container, for a maximum of 2-3 days. Before serving it again, you can heat it in the oven at 350°F for about 10 minutes to restore its crispness.
For a vegetarian version, you can replace the bacon with grilled vegetables, such as zucchini, peppers, eggplants, or with sautéed mushrooms. If you love strong flavors, you can replace the brie with gorgonzola or smoked mozzarella.
