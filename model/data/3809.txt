Golden color and glossy glaze make caramelized potatoes stand out instantly on any holiday table. Their soft , waxy texture and SWEET flavor turn every bite into a real crowd-pleaser at Christmas dinner or whenever you want a little tradition. Caramelized potatoes —a true classic among holiday side dishes —are loved for their traditional Danish style and pretty appearance. The satisfying bite comes from that delicate sugar glaze: just a thin shell that’s slightly crisp on the outside with a waxy and soft potato on the inside. These caramel potatoes always bring a festive, nostalgic feel, calling back memories of family holidays and special gatherings, yet they look just as beautiful next to favorite comfort foods year-round. Families notice the warm, golden look and how these sweet potatoes light up regular meals, fancy feasts, or casual parties...while still fitting into familiar weeknight dinners with something a little special on the side.
Versatility is a big reason home cooks and busy families add caramelized potatoes to their list of reliable favorites. Pair them with Christmas potato recipes to anchor traditional spreads, set them out as part of larger holiday side dishes , or serve them next to moist roasts, hearty beef, and Danish specialties—these sweet gems handle it all. Often topping lists of Danish potato recipe staples, they appeal to everyone at the table, young and old, thanks to their natural sweet flavor and rich , tender bite. Works as a nice addition for potlucks, family dinners, or festive banquets (and leftovers taste GREAT cold). Some families like them with simple steamed greens, others enjoy these potatoes alongside flaky fish for classic contrast...no matter what, their golden coat and mellow, sweet flavor guarantee plenty of smiles. With caramel potatoes , you get a dish that works for almost any kind of meal—making every gathering a little more memorable and giving you one more nice reason to come back for seconds. Serve as an easy, DELICIOUS centerpiece or supporting favorite—either way, they keep their spot in Danish traditions while fitting perfectly into modern family life. Caramelized potatoes stick around for good reason: classic, pretty, and always nice on any table.
Wash the new potatoes and blanch them in salted boiling water for about 5-10 minutes , (depending on the size of the potatoes), then drain and peel them . The potatoes should not be cooked too much, otherwise, they will break during the cooking in the pan.
In a large pan, melt the butter, add the brown sugar and stir, then when it is melted , pour the lemon juice into the pan ; mix well
and add the peeled new potatoes , let them cook on low heat for about 10-15 minutes, then salt , add the paprika
let the potatoes absorb the flavors for a few minutes and towards the end of cooking (when the caramel is nice and thick), add the chopped parsley , turn the potatoes to blend all the flavors and turn off the heat. If you want, you can serve the caramelized new potatoes sprinkled with thin lemon zest strips.
Caramelized new potatoes are best eaten immediately, but if you wish, you can store them in the refrigerator for a couple of days in an airtight container; when serving, reheat them in a pan adding a ladle of water! Caramelized new potatoes can also be frozen; let them thaw in the refrigerator or directly in the pan.
If you want, you can prepare the caramelized potatoes by replacing the lemon juice and zest with orange, and using ground pepper instead of paprika.
