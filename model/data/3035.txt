If you ever find yourself in Salento, which is the stunning heel of Italy, and you’re craving something refreshing, you just have to try the caffè freddo in ghiaccio di mandorla . This isn’t your average iced coffee. Nope. It’s a clever twist with almond milk syrup—frozen into ice cubes. Genius, right? So instead of watering down your drink, these almond ice cubes melt slowly, giving it a smooth, nutty flavor. Locals in Salento are absolutely crazy about it. And you’ll spot it in bars all over Lecce and the coastline. They use top-notch Arabica coffee— bold and fresh. Seriously, those almond ice cubes make it super super interesting compared to anything else in Italy.
Often called caffè leccese or caffè salentino , this drink combines strong coffee and cool, creamy almond ice. Perfect, right? When you’re looking to ditch the hot drinks but want something that feels like a treat, this is it. The almond syrup offers this mildly sweet taste that pairs so well with coffee—it’s like enjoying dessert and coffee all at once. Pretty cool. Plus, what really sets this caffè in ghiaccio apart is that your coffee stays strong and refreshing until the last sip. Not a single watered-down taste. It's perfect for the laid-back, social vibe of Salento’s summer afternoons.
And look, whether you’re chilling with friends or cooling off after a walk, a glass of caffè con latte di mandorla is a chilled pick-me-up—really really brings a slice of Southern Italy to your day. I mean, it’s no wonder people across Italy rave about it as the ultimate bevanda estiva al caffè when the sun's blazing. So, next time you’re in the area, make sure to try this delicious drink. Seriously, savor a bit of Salento's charm. You won’t regret it.
Preparing iced coffee with almond ice is very simple. Start by pouring the almond milk syrup into a large container , then add the water gradually to temper it (2 -3).
Mix the ingredients until you obtain a homogeneous mixture , then transfer the mixture into the appropriate ice molds , being careful to fill each mold to the brim. Then gently place the molds in the freezer and let the mixture freeze for at least 3 hours, until it is completely frozen .
After the necessary time, dedicate yourself to preparing the coffee with the moka pot: put cold water, preferably low in limescale, into the boiler up to the safety valve (otherwise you will get weaker coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee and level each teaspoon of coffee added by tapping the filter on the table with firm movements , until you reach the edge of the filter.
Do not press with the teaspoon, nor make holes, and screw the coffee maker well (to prevent the coffee from spilling from the sides as it rises), then place it on a low and constant flame to obtain a full-bodied coffee. As the coffee rises, a thick froth will form ; we recommend not letting the coffee bubble for too long to keep its aroma and sweetness intact. Then turn off the heat and your coffee to use in the preparation is ready: stir it directly in the moka pot with a teaspoon to make it more homogeneous .
Remove the almond milk syrup cubes from the molds, and for each low tumbler glass, put 6 or 7 cubes and 1.7 oz (50 ml) of coffee, being careful to pour it close to the edge and not over the ice cubes to ensure they remain white . Continue in the same way for the other glasses. You will have your iced coffee with almond ice to sip pleasantly !
The iced coffee with almond ice should be consumed immediately. The frozen almond milk syrup cubes can be stored in the freezer for a few weeks.
