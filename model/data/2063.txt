So, here's the deal—dive into the world of Indian flavors with the turmeric panini , a refreshing twist on your usual sandwich. Turmeric , often called the "saffron of India," isn't just about its vibrant color; it gives these buns a golden hue and an earthy, subtle flavor. Really, it's way way different from typical curry powders. In India, turmeric is a staple, and it pops up in both sweet and savory buns. The savory version brings a salty kick from Riviera olives, while the sweet one has that soft sweetness of sultana raisins. The buns are tender and fluffy—cannot go wrong with that—making them perfect for any meal. Enjoy them plain, or add cheese and veggies for a turmeric sandwich that's both fun and a bit unexpected. And the sauce? Optional, but delicious. You can even go for a turmeric chicken panini if you are after something more filling.
What makes this healthy panini recipe exciting is how it showcases turmeric beyond its usual role in curries. Some folks like to add Indian spices for a super super spiced vibe, but even just the turmeric makes these buns feel special. The moist texture is ideal for those who like bread that stays fresh. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner—these panini buns fit right in. Add grilled veggies, and you've got a turmeric grilled sandwich that feels fresh and adventurous. For real, it's something else. In some parts of India, people experiment with different add-ins, but the sweet raisins or briny olives really set these apart from typical bread. Pretty much a standout. Each batch is unique, so you can switch up the fillings and enjoy a golden panini recipe that's never dull. It's a dish that's ready for new twists, with results that are tasty and delightfully out of the ordinary. So, whether you're spicing up breakfast or creating a memorable dinner, these turmeric panini buns are sure to impress with their versatility and flavor.
To prepare the turmeric rolls, first melt the butter over low heat, then let it cool and in the meantime start making the dough. Sift both flours into a bowl , add the dry yeast , and the sugar
and the turmeric . Start kneading with your hands, slowly pouring in the milk at room temperature and continue until you get a homogeneous dough.
At this point, add the melted butter, now at room temperature , the salt , and knead again with your hands until fully combined. Transfer the dough to a work surface and work it with your hands until it is smooth and elastic; this will take about 15 minutes. If you prefer, you can use a stand mixer with a hook for these steps.
Then shape the dough into a ball , place it in a large bowl and cover it with plastic wrap . Let it rise in the oven turned off with the light on for about 2 hours until the dough has doubled in size. When there are about twenty minutes left, soak the raisins in cold water to rehydrate them .
Once the dough has doubled, remove the plastic wrap and gently transfer it onto a floured surface using a dough scraper . Then divide it in half; you should obtain 2 portions of 15 oz each .
Take one and slightly flatten it with your hands , then drain the raisins well (if necessary, pat them with paper towels) and place them in the center of your portion of dough .
Then simply incorporate them by rolling everything ; gently slide the dough between the work surface and your fingers, creating a log , which you can then divide into 6 portions of 3 oz each .
Using your hands, take the outer edges of each portion and bring them towards the center , then shape each one into a ball by rotating the ball between the work surface and the bottom of your palm . You will thus obtain 6 identical balls ;
place them on a slightly floured baking sheet and repeat the same operation for the olive rolls. Then take the second 15 oz portion of dough set aside earlier, flatten it a bit with your hands and add the olives, drained from their brine . Create the usual log, divide it into 6 pieces of 3 oz each
and form the balls as you did before . Place them on the baking sheet , cover with plastic wrap , and let them rise for another 30 minutes at room temperature. Meanwhile, preheat the oven, setting it to the static mode, and bring it to a temperature of 392°F.
When the oven has reached the indicated temperature and the turmeric rolls have risen, moisten the surface with water; it is advisable to use a kitchen spray bottle for this operation . Bake your rolls for 30 minutes, on the lower shelf of the oven, until they are golden. Then take them out , let them cool, and serve them .
Turmeric rolls can be stored at room temperature, in a paper or plastic bag, for up to 2-3 days. Once baked, they can also be frozen.
Once you have moistened the surface of the rolls, you can enrich them with various seeds (sesame, sunflower, poppy) or with hazelnut crumbs!
