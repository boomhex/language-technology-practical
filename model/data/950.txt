In Campania , they really know how to turn simple ingredients into something amazing, and zucchini pullastiello is a prime example. Really. This dish takes inspiration from the classic Neapolitan eggplant recipe but with zucchini for a fresh twist. What makes zucchini a pullastiello stand out? The double-frying action. First, you slice and fry the zucchini until it’s golden and crispy. Then it's stuffed with scamorza cheese and bits of Neapolitan salami, breaded and fried again. Seriously good.
