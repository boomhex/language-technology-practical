instructions:
To prepare paccheri with cotechino ragù, first briefly boil the precooked cotechino for a few minutes to make it easier to peel. Then remove the casing and cut the cotechino first into half-centimeter slices and then into cubes . Clean and chop celery, onion, and carrot .
Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large pan, then add the whole fresh chili pepper, whole peeled garlic, and rosemary . After sautéing for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, add the diced cotechino and increase the heat to cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. After another 3 minutes, add the chopped celery, carrot, and onion , and continue stirring, browning the ingredients well in the pan.
After 5 minutes you can deglaze with the wine and let it evaporate before adding the tomato puree . Stir, lower the heat, and remove the garlic .
Continue cooking with the lid on for about 30 minutes . Once ready, the ragù should be quite dense . Bring water to a boil in a large pot, salt it, and cook the paccheri .
Drain them directly into the pan with the sauce , then toss over high heat and stir with Grana Padano PDO . Add cooking water if necessary, stir again, turn off the heat, and serve your paccheri with cotechino ragù piping hot .
Paccheri with cotechino ragù can be stored for 1-2 days in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
We doubt it, but if there are leftovers, you can pour them into a baking dish, sprinkle with a cheese like caciocavallo or scamorza, and bake at 392°F for about 10 minutes for a tasty gratin!
