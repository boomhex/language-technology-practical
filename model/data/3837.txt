First, prepare the pea cream: finely chop the shallot and heat the butter in a large saucepan , add the chopped shallot and let it sauté for a couple of minutes ;
add the peas , stir to flavor , and let them cook for about 15 minutes, until they are very tender, adding vegetable broth if needed , and season with salt.
Transfer the cooked peas to a blender cup and blend until a smooth mixture is obtained . If desired, you can also strain the cream through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any pea skin residues. Return the pea cream thus obtained to a saucepan and add the nutmeg ,
season with white pepper ; add the grated Pecorino and Grana Padano DOP , mix well, and keep warm.
Meanwhile, bring plenty of salted water to a boil and cook the gnocchetti for the time indicated on the package; drain them al dente and quickly toss them in the saucepan with the cream (14-15). Adjust the salt if necessary and serve the gnocchetti with pea cream piping hot.
Gnocchetti with pea cream can be stored for a couple of days in the refrigerator inside an airtight container. They can also be frozen and reheated directly in the pan when ready to serve.
Gnocchetti with pea cream can be enriched with an extra touch of flavor by quickly browning diced speck or smoked bacon in a small pan without additional fats and adding them to the pea cream when tossing the pasta with the cream. Or, if you want to keep the vegetarian version, you can add even more flavor to the gnocchetti with pea cream by grating some salted ricotta just before serving.
