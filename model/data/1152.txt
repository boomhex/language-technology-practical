instructions:
First, wash and dry the arugula, then finely chop it with a knife . In a pan, brown the garlic with a drizzle of oil, then add the arugula and let it flavor for a few minutes, stirring often .
Pour the ground meat into a large bowl, then add the grated Grana Padano PDO cheese , the egg , and the arugula .
Add a pinch of salt and mix well until you obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Take a portion of about 1 oz of mixture and form meatballs , which you will place on a cutting board. After forming the meatballs, pour the breadcrumbs into a container and coat the meatballs evenly . At this point, heat plenty of seed oil in a pan and fry the meatballs for 2-3 minutes per side .
When they are well browned, drain the meatballs with a slotted spoon and transfer to absorbent paper to remove excess oil . Serve your rocket meatballs on a bed of fresh arugula !
Rocket meatballs can be stored in the refrigerator for about 2 days. You can freeze them before cooking, making sure to let them thaw in the fridge before frying.
As an alternative to frying, you can bake the meatballs in a ventilated oven at 400°F for about 20 minutes, adding a drizzle of oil. For an even tastier variant, enrich the mixture with diced bacon and chili!
