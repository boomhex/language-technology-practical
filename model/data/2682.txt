instructions:
To prepare the spelt salad with vegetables, bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it to taste , then add the spelt and boil it for the time indicated on the package (about twenty minutes). Meanwhile, prepare the dressing: wash and cut the cherry tomatoes into quarters (you can remove the seeds if you don't like them).
Then cut the provolone into cubes ; wash and separate the florets from the main broccoli stalk and cut them in half .
Trim the green beans then blanch them in a pot and do the same with the broccoli florets in a separate pot . A few minutes will suffice as the vegetables should remain crunchy.
When the spelt is cooked, drain it and rinse it quickly under cold running water (10-11). Then place it in a bowl and add the cherry tomatoes
also add the drained and cooled vegetables: the green beans cut into pieces and the florets . Then also add the cubed provolone .
and the walnuts coarsely chopped . Grate the zest of 1 untreated lemon and some fresh basil. If you like, you can also add a drizzle of oil and mix everything. Your spelt salad with vegetables is ready to be enjoyed !
Store the spelt salad with vegetables in the refrigerator for 1-2 days covered with plastic wrap. Freezing is not recommended.
For a more intense flavor, you could replace the provolone with feta and the walnuts with cashews, add fresh aromatic herbs to taste like mint and thyme.
