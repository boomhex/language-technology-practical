instructions:
To prepare the phyllo dough cake with ricotta and chocolate, start by making the cream. Pour the ricotta into a strainer and sift it into a bowl , then add the powdered sugar and mix to combine everything.
Add also the orange zest and the previously beaten eggs , then gently whisk until you get a smooth and homogeneous cream .
Finally, add the chocolate chips , mix once again and set your cream aside. At this point, take the phyllo dough sheets and use them to line a 9-inch pan (measured on the surface; bottom 8.9 inches). Brush with melted butter to adhere the various sheets of dough and continue in this manner
until you finish them . Trim the excess edge with scissors and also pour the cream into the mold .
Level the surface with a spatula , then bake the cake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 45 minutes (check the cooking about ten minutes before, depending on the power of your oven; check when it is nicely golden on the edges). At this point, take out your phyllo dough cake with ricotta and chocolate and let it cool before unmolding and serving it !
The phyllo dough cake with ricotta and chocolate can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Flavor the cream with the taste you love most... vanilla, lemon, lime, or cinnamon?
