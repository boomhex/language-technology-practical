Artichokes with breadcrumbs , or 'carciofi ammuddicati,' is this classic Sicilian dish that’s all about simple, honest ingredients. Seriously good stuff. The Sicilians, you know, have a unique way of preparing these stuffed artichokes . They peel off those tougher outer leaves until what's left is just right. Pretty much tender and definitely not chewy. The breadcrumbs, or 'mollica,' mixed with sharp cheeses, fresh herbs, and a splash of olive oil, make every bite moist and savory. And look, this mix gets stuffed into the artichoke hearts, turning a basic veggie into something amazing. Really, you’ll want more. Across Sicily, you’ll see these at dinner tables, especially in spring when artichokes are everywhere—super tasty.

I mean, you'll find similar breadcrumb stuffings in anchovies or eggplant—'mollica' is a go-to for a crispy layer and rich taste in so many dishes. When you bite into these stuffed artichokes , you taste the sweet and earthy notes of the artichoke itself, with that salty edge from cheese and those golden crumbs on top. And here's the thing, it works as a vegetarian main or as a starter or side, depending on your mood.

Clean the artichokes: cut off the stem completely , remove the outer and tough leaves and with a paring knife round off the base of the artichoke .
Then cut the tip and spread open the artichoke like a flower to easily remove the internal choke . Place the cleaned artichoke upside down in a bowl of acidulated water with the juice of a lemon and repeat the same operation for the others.
Prepare the breadcrumb mixture: grate the pecorino with the fine side of the grater and the caciocavallo with the coarser side . Finely chop a clove of garlic and the parsley.
In a bowl, combine breadcrumbs, garlic , parsley, and the cheeses .
Add salt, pepper , and oil . Mix until you get a sandy and moist mixture .
Take the artichokes and gently tap them on a cloth to remove excess water and dry them. Stuff them with the breadcrumb mixture, being generous in the center and then proceed by spreading the outer petals and stuffing them as well . Finally, press the mixture well with your hands to return the artichoke to its rounded shape .
Pour a swirl of oil and a clove of garlic into a thick-bottomed pan . Let it flavor for a couple of minutes, then place the artichokes inside , which should be close, upright, and tight. Pour some water into the pan (you can rinse the jug where you weighed the oil) .
Cover with the lid , lower the heat and cook gently for about half an hour. During cooking, ensure the artichokes remain moist, adding a splash of water if necessary. Remove the lid, let any cooking liquid evaporate , and then serve the artichokes ammuddicati hot, with a grind of pepper and a drizzle of extra oil to taste .
We recommend consuming the artichokes immediately after preparation. Since they are very delicate, it is better not to store them and consume them right away.
You can choose the variety of artichoke you prefer, any type will do. The stem of the artichokes can be peeled and used in other recipes, such as an artichoke rice or a simple vegetable broth.
You can enrich your breadcrumb mixture with lemon zest. Adjust the garlic to your taste. If you don't love it, you can omit it, otherwise, you can increase the amount by chopping two or three cloves of garlic. Common breadcrumbs work fine, but we recommend mixing it with a part of grated bread or using homemade breadcrumbs for a more rustic effect and better taste.
If there is too much space left in the center of the pan, insert half a potato to keep the artichokes tight.
