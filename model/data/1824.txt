Mountain sugar cookies , or zuccherini montanari , really capture the rustic charm of Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna. Nestled in the heart of the Italian Apennines, these tasty, ring-shaped cookies have been lovingly passed down from mother to daughter. And you know what? The rich aroma of anise wafting through the kitchen is just amazing. These treats are prepared for local festivals or weddings, often strung together as charming cookie necklaces. Pretty unique, right? The cookies have a tender bite with a hint of anise that is both unique and comforting. Plus, they’re dipped in a thick, glossy sugar glaze, giving them that characteristic high altitude sugar cookies look and a crunchy exterior that contrasts beautifully with their soft interior.
Mountain sugar cookies are more than just a sweet treat; they’re really a symbol of community and family gatherings. When they appear on the table, you know there’s a gathering where everyone enjoys the soft, almost moist center paired with the crisp sugar shell. Honestly, what's really fascinating is that you don’t need any fancy equipment or even a scale to make these cookies—everything is measured by hand, just like it’s always been done in those beautiful hills. Folks who understand high altitude baking get why these cookies thrive up there—simple, golden recipes often handle the mountain air best. Whether displayed on a plate or hanging as a gift—so charming—these cookies are all about keeping cherished traditions alive. Each bite is not just a taste of sugar and anise; it’s a real slice of mountain life from central Italy, a reminder of simpler times, and a celebration of cultural heritage. So, when you enjoy a batch, you’re savoring more than just a cookie—you’re really experiencing a rich history and a taste of home that’s as warm as the Italian sun. For real.
To prepare the mountain sugar cookies, first place the eggs and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment . Start working the mixture at medium speed, then add the vegetable oil and the anise liqueur while keeping the stand mixer running .
When you have obtained a light and frothy mixture , turn off the stand mixer and sift the flour and baking powder into the bowl . Turn the mixer back on to combine all the ingredients and obtain a homogeneous dough .
Transfer the dough to your work surface and shape it into a smooth and uniform ball . Take about one-fifth of the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 0.4 inches, then cut strips about 4 inches long and 0.8 inches wide (8-9).
Take one strip at a time and shape it into a cord, rounding it with the tips of your fingers against the work surface . Gently twist the ends of the cord , then close them into a ring to create a small donut shape . Overlap the ends and press gently to ensure they stay attached. Continue this way until you have used all the dough.
Place the donuts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 20 minutes, placing it on the middle rack. About 5 minutes before the end of baking, start on the glaze: in a large saucepan, pour in the sugar, water, and anise liqueur and let it simmer over low heat, monitoring the temperature with a thermometer .
When the cookies are baked, take them out of the oven , and once the syrup reaches a temperature of 221°F, add them directly to the saucepan . Stir carefully over low heat to ensure all the cookies are uniformly coated with the syrup .
Continue until the cookies appear frosted because the sugar has crystallized . Pour the cookies onto a tray covered with parchment paper and let them cool completely , after which your mountain sugar cookies will be ready to be devoured !
The mountain sugar cookies can be stored at room temperature, inside a tin box or in food bags, for about ten days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can further flavor the dough by adding 0.7 oz of anise seeds. If you don't have a stand mixer, you can easily make the dough by hand as it was once done!
