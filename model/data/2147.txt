instructions:
Pasta with trout is, honestly, one of those dishes you’ll find on lakeside tables in Northern Italy, like in Lombardy and Trentino-Alto Adige . Really good stuff. It’s a mix of tender trout flakes and the earthiness of julienned verza, or savoy cabbage. The magic? The way this dish blends mild, slightly sweet fish with bold anchovies, plus fresh tomato. You wouldn’t think trout and anchovies go together, but they really do. Seriously good. The trout pasta recipe just feels simple and genuine, like it belongs there. And look, it's not heavy at all. Pretty much a refreshing change from the cream-based seafood pastas you might know from other places.
Mixing the delicate trout with pasta gives you something light yet packed with flavor. And it doesn’t stop there. Adding the savoy cabbage gives a crisp bite, while tomatoes keep it bright and a bit tangy. The real magic? How the fish and veggies come together. It’s like a lakeside version of seafood pasta but with its own twist. And here’s the thing: in Northern Italy, some folks use smoked trout. For sure, it adds an extra layer of flavor, turning it into something like smoked trout pasta —great if you want a bit more punch.
These regional dishes let the main ingredients shine without complicating things. You know, that classic, homey feel. For anyone tired of the usual creamy trout pasta or just curious about a new take on healthy fish pasta , this is your dish. And you know what? It is easy enough to whip up for a quick trout dinner. Yet, the taste always feels special, like dining by a beautiful lakeside. Whether you are at home or dreaming of Northern Italy, this dish truly brings a touch of the region's culinary charm to your table.
To prepare the pasta with trout, start by placing a pot with plenty of water on the heat and add salt when it boils. Meanwhile, prepare all the ingredients you will need: clean and finely chop the shallot , then wash and dry the cabbage, remove the outer leaves and the central stem , and cut the remaining part into strips .
Rinse the tomatoes, remove the green part of the stem , and cut them first into slices and then into cubes . Finally, take the trout fillets: remove the skin by gently running the knife along the skin, starting from the tail to the head , and feel the meat with your fingers to check for any bones: if present, you can remove them with kitchen tweezers.
Cut the trout fillets into chunks . Heat a pan with extra virgin olive oil, add the chopped shallot , and let it simmer on low heat for about 5 minutes; when the shallot is almost transparent, add the anchovies drained from their preservation oil .
and the cabbage cut into strips , salt and pepper to taste, and cook on high heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally . Now add the trout chunks to the pan , mix
and deglaze with white wine , allowing it to evaporate completely. Finally, add the diced tomatoes , adjust salt and pepper and cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat .
Meanwhile, boil the farfalle pasta in the pot with salted boiling water to taste . Drain the pasta al dente and pour it into the pan with the sauce , stir to combine everything , and serve your pasta with trout hot!
We recommend serving the pasta with trout as soon as it's ready. If necessary, you can store it in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to one day. Freezing is not recommended.
If you want to add a fragrant note that brings freshness to your pasta with trout and cabbage, don't hesitate to garnish the dish with a few basil leaves or some lemon zest... and of course, a pinch of chili pepper if you love spicy food!
