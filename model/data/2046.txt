Polenta rolls bring a bit of Northern Italy right to your table, especially with that Lombardy touch. Folks in this region are really serious about their polenta rolls . They make them with local stuff like Taleggio and Parmigiano cheeses. That combo? Melt-in-your-mouth gooey and creamy. It gives you a bite that’s both rich and satisfying. And look, what makes this appetizer really really different is the way it’s paired with pear slices that get marinated in red wine and a hit of thyme. Those pears turn soft and sweet with just a little tang, and when you take a bite with the warm polenta, you get this awesome mix of tender and crunchy in every mouthful. Seriously good. It’s a pretty fun twist on the usual polenta, and you can really smell that thyme and wine when the plate hits the table. People in Lombardy love to show off their cheeses in antipasti, and this polenta roll recipe is a cool example of how tradition can get a little creative.
Instead of being just a side, these stuffed polenta rolls hold their own as the main event at any dinner party, especially when you want something a bit more special than the usual fare. Pretty much. Biting into the golden outside, you get hit with that stretchy, melting cheese inside (formaggio fila!), and the aromatic pears bring a splash of color and flavor that keeps things interesting. For sure. In towns across Northern Italy, especially in Lombardy, it’s normal to find polenta topped with cheese, but rolling it up like this and adding fruit shows just how playful Italian antipasti can be. Whether you call it a baked polenta roll or a polenta roulade , this dish is all about mixing flavors and textures in a way that feels both familiar and surprising. Really, it’s a great way to start off a meal when you want to impress friends and give them a taste of something really regional and moist with every bite. The combination of traditional ingredients with a modern twist makes this dish a true celebration of Northern Italian cuisine. Can't go wrong.
To prepare the polenta rolls, fill a tall pot with water and start heating it on low. When the water boils, add salt and pour about 2 teaspoons of olive oil , then sprinkle in the flour while stirring with a whisk
Cook on low heat for a couple of minutes, continuing to stir to avoid lumps . After cooking, the polenta should be soft and not too stiff, turn off the heat, cover with a lid , and set the polenta aside. Remove the rind from the Taleggio cheese and cut it into cubes .
Now oil the center part of a parchment paper sheet with a spatula and pour onto the oiled spot the polenta, a couple of tablespoons will be enough . Spread it over the surface with a spatula ,
until you obtain a square of about 4x4 inches. Fill the center with 1 3/4 oz of Taleggio cut into cubes and the grated Parmesan cheese , finally sprinkle with black pepper to taste. Fold the parchment paper by lifting the sides to more easily fold the lateral parts , then gently roll the sheet to create a roll . Proceed in the same way for the others: we recommend doing these operations quickly so as not to let the remaining polenta become too firm in the pot.
Once all the rolls are prepared , place them on a tray and let them set in the fridge for at least 20 minutes. Now prepare the garnish: wash and cut the pears in half without peeling them , then remove the seeds and the central core,
cut each half again into two equal parts and each quarter into 3 wedges . Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a pan, add the pear wedges , salt and pepper to taste
toast the pears on both sides and then deglaze with red wine , let the wine evaporate and cook the pears on both sides for 2-3 minutes, they should remain crunchy . After resting, take the polenta rolls, cut them in half diagonally .
Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a pan and brown the rolls for about 2 minutes (22-23), they should just turn golden on the surface and the filling should be gooey. Once ready, serve the polenta rolls with the wine pears, scent them with fresh thyme, and enjoy them hot !
Once cooked, it is preferable to consume them immediately. If you haven't browned them in the pan, you can store them rolled up in the fridge for up to 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of Taleggio, you can also use Gorgonzola. You can prepare the rolls the day before so they firm up better in the fridge.
