instructions:
To prepare the soda bread, pour the two flours into a bowl , salt , and baking soda .
Gradually pour in the milk while kneading with your hands , using a spatula and don't worry if the dough is sticky. As soon as the milk is completely absorbed and you have obtained a homogeneous mixture, transfer it into a mold, lined with a sheet of parchment paper, measuring about 8 inches across the top and 7 inches at the base .
Use a spatula to spread the dough throughout the pan and level the surface . Moisten a cutter and use it to make a cross-shaped cut .
At this point , bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 40 minutes on the middle rack. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool before slicing and serving .
You can store the soda bread in a plastic bag for up to 2 days. You can freeze the soda bread and thaw it at room temperature as needed.
Once, soda bread was cooked on griddles placed over the fire, due to the lack of bread ovens. Despite the advent of technology, this cooking method has been preserved, to the extent that today, specialized Irish bakers cook it in cast iron pots with lids.
