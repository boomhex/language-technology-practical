instructions:
To prepare the puff pastry bites with cheese and honey, first season the goat cheese with a drizzle of olive oil , salt , and pepper, and mix to obtain a homogeneous cream .
Roll out the puff pastry on the work surface and cut out 40 discs with a pastry cutter with a diameter of 1.4 inches , then transfer 20 of these discs onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Cut the remaining discs with a smaller pastry cutter, with a diameter of 1 inch ,
then remove the central part to obtain rings 0.4 inches wide . At this point, prick the discs you have placed on the baking sheet with a fork and brush them with the milk and yolk mixture you previously whisked together .
Place a puff pastry ring on top of each disc and pour a teaspoon of cheese cream in the center : if you wish, you can use a pastry bag. Bake in a preheated static oven at 390°F for 10 minutes, then remove from the oven, let cool slightly, and add some thyme leaves .
Finally, pour the chestnut honey into a small bowl, add the stripped thyme and mix well . Garnish your puff pastry bites with cheese and honey with the thyme honey and serve them with the small bowl on the side !
It is recommended to consume the puff pastry bites with cheese and honey immediately to maintain their crispness.
You can sprinkle the discs with paprika after brushing them. Additionally, you can enrich the goat cheese cream with chopped nuts to add a crunchy note!
