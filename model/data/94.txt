instructions:
To prepare the mushroom omelette, first finely chop the garlic clove . Proceed to the How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms : remove the end of the stem and clean the mushrooms with a damp cloth .
At this point, slice them thinly . In a non-stick pan, heat 2 teaspoons of oil with the chopped garlic , then add the mushrooms and cook over medium heat for 8 minutes or until the water has evaporated.
Add the salt , chopped parsley , mix well , turn off the heat and let cool.
In a bowl, break the eggs, add a pinch of salt , and beat them well with a whisk .
Turn the heat back on under the mushrooms. Add the remaining oil and when the pan is hot, pour in the egg mixture . Wait a few minutes , then cover with a lid .
Lower the flame and cook for another 8 minutes, always on low flame, it will not be necessary to flip the omelette. Once cooked , transfer it to a serving plate, garnish with more chopped parsley , and serve .
You can store the mushroom omelette in the refrigerator for 1-2 days in an airtight container. When ready to serve, warm it briefly in the oven or in a pan. If you wish, you can also freeze it already portioned: let it cool completely, then transfer it to the freezer. When needed, just heat it directly in the oven or in a pan to enjoy it as if freshly made!
To make the mushroom omelette even more flavorful, you can add some cubes of melting cheese like scamorza or provola, or a tablespoon of grated Parmigiano Reggiano for a more intense taste. If you love intense aromas, try flavoring with fresh chopped parsley or a pinch of thyme: they will perfectly enhance the taste of the mushrooms! Instead of champignons, you can use porcini mushrooms or other varieties!
