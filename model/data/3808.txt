To prepare the new potatoes with red wine, start by washing the new potatoes well , and blanch them for a few minutes in a pot with salted boiling water until their inside is tender, then drain them well. Cut the larger ones in half. In a large pan, melt the butter over very low heat ; in the meantime, chop the shallots into coarse pieces ,
add them to the pan with the now melted butter and let them brown nicely , then deglaze with half of the red wine and let it evaporate. Then add the potatoes and let them brown as well along with the sage leaves ;
at this point, adjust with salt. Mix well to combine the ingredients and then add the remaining wine . Finish cooking the potatoes and complete with a nice grind of black pepper . Serve the new potatoes with red wine piping hot !
You can prepare the new potatoes with red wine by replacing the shallots with fresh scallions, and if you can't find new potatoes, you can use regular potatoes cut into rather large pieces.
