To prepare tagliatelle straw and hay with chanterelle and speck ragù, start with the preparation of the ragù: gently wash the chanterelle mushrooms under running water (it is advisable to do this quickly, as chanterelles absorb water very easily; if they are not too dirty, using a damp cloth will suffice). Drain them very well (if necessary, gently pat them dry with a kitchen towel) and slice them finely . Chop the onion and sauté it in butter over low heat for a few minutes ;
add the crushed garlic and a pinch of salt, this way the onions will release some moisture, then add the chanterelles , deglaze with white wine, then cook everything over medium heat for about 15 minutes, or until the wine is fully evaporated. In the meantime, prepare the speck by cutting it into cubes
blend half of it with a mixer , or a small blender, and add it to the cooking mushrooms . In another non-stick pan, sauté the remaining cubed speck to make it crispy
then add it to the ragù being prepared, cooking everything for another 10 minutes or so . Toward the end of cooking, add the cream , mix well and adjust salt and pepper. Then proceed to prepare the pasta, and serve it on a plate
and immerse it in boiling water as soon as the water is boiling ; when al dente, drain and toss it with the prepared ragù (if it seems too dry, you can soften it with a few tablespoons of cooking water). Tagliatelle straw and hay with chanterelle and speck ragù is ready: serve immediately, garnishing the serving plate with a sprig or a sprinkle of parsley.
Store tagliatelle straw and hay with chanterelle and speck ragù in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one day.
If you cannot find chanterelles (girolles) or do not have enough of them, you can prepare this ragù with other mushrooms, such as porcini or honey mushrooms.
