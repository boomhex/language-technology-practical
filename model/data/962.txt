Arista with pears, walnuts, and pecorino is a classic dish straight out of the heart of Tuscany. Perfect for special occasions or, you know, when you just want to treat yourself. It's not just any pork tenderloin recipe —the tender meat gets a really flavorful boost from sweet pears and the sharp, salty kick of pecorino cheese. This one's from Tuscany, really. Folks around Florence and Siena? They swear by using pecorino stagionato because its crumbly texture and bold taste pair beautifully with the moist roast. Seriously good.
And here's the thing—the toasted walnuts are the real kicker here. They add a nice, crispy bite and a hint of earthiness that you don't always find in a pork and walnut dish . Compared to plain pork roasts, this combination feels festive and makes the whole table feel special, especially when everyone’s reaching for slices and chatting over the food. Really, really good.
You’ll often see this roasted pork with pears at big gatherings or holiday dinners. It serves as a delicious centerpiece. People crowd around, drawn by the golden slices and amazing aroma. Some families in Tuscany prefer a slow oven roast to let the flavors mingle and get cozy, but a quick stovetop version—really—can save time on busier nights while keeping things tasty. The pears break down as they cook, mixing with the pork juices and giving everything a tangy and slightly sweet edge. Pretty simple.
Having this arista recipe in your back pocket means you’re ready for anything, from a cozy Sunday dinner to a full-on Italian feast. There’s just something about the mix of nuts, fruit, and cheese that works, you know? Every bite offers a bit of everything—tender meat, crispy walnut, and the deep flavor of aged cheese. It’s no wonder this Italian pork roast is such a go-to for anyone wanting a dish that feels both homey and a bit fancy. Whether you’re celebrating or just enjoying a meal with loved ones, this dish brings a touch of Tuscany to your table. And the sauce? So good.
To prepare the pork loin with pears, walnuts, and pecorino, start with the meat. Place the piece of pork loin on the cutting board and rub with salt and pepper. Then cut one of the pears in half and slice thinly with a mandoline. Shave the aged Tuscan pecorino and finally chop the walnuts. Pour the chopped nuts into a non-stick pan and toast for a few minutes, stirring continuously. Now that you have everything, arrange the pancetta on the cutting board, sprinkle with half of the pecorino and the chopped nuts. Place the piece of pork loin in the middle and wrap around the meat. Cover with the pear slices and tie everything with kitchen twine. Move to the stove, heat some extra virgin olive oil in a saucepan, and place the piece of meat. Let it sear on all sides, turning it with two wooden spoons or tongs. Transfer the meat to a rack placed in a baking tray and cook in the oven, preheated in convection mode, at 430°F for 15 minutes, then lower to 355°F and continue for another 10-12 minutes. When cooked, cover the meat with a sheet of aluminum foil for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the other 4 Williams pears in half, add them to the remaining 1/2 pear. Melt a knob of butter in the pan and add the garlic and rosemary. As soon as the base is hot, add the pears and cook for a few minutes, just to soften them slightly. Then caramelize them by raising the heat and adding the honey; as soon as they are browned, proceed with plating. Slice the pork loin and accompany it with the remaining pears, chopped nuts, and pecorino, drizzling with the pears' cooking juices. Your pork loin with pears, walnuts, and pecorino is ready, enjoy your meal!
It is recommended to consume the pork loin with pears, walnuts, and pecorino immediately because the meat tends to dry out quickly. However, if you prefer, you can store it in the refrigerator and consume it the next day.
If you want to add a touch of Christmas red, add some red berries, like currants or raspberries, fresh or quickly cooked with a little sugar to obtain a delicious tart sauce. Measure the internal temperature of the meat with a roast thermometer: this way, you will be sure of the optimal cooking. With the indicated minutes, the meat will be rare, and the temperature will be 118°F-125°F. By increasing the time a little, the meat will be more cooked.
