To prepare chicken cream, start by placing two washed, peeled, and halved carrots in a liter and a half of water, an onion studded with cloves, bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme bundled and tied with kitchen string, and peppercorns . Bring to a boil and cook for about 20 minutes. Salt the broth and add the chicken breast, which should cook for 20 minutes, until it's completely white inside . Remove the chicken from the broth, drain it, let it cool, and remove the bones and cartilage, cutting the flesh into small pieces .
Finely chop the flesh with half a cup of broth in a mixer . Strain the chicken broth using a sieve to remove the vegetables and herbs and set it aside . In a saucepan, place the finely crumbled breadcrumbs and add half a liter of the obtained broth , put it on the stove and stir until the broth thickens, add the chopped chicken, and stir well to combine everything.
Adjust the salt if necessary and add a sprinkle of nutmeg . Blend the cream again in the mixer to make it smooth and remove any lumps. To complete the chicken cream, add the fresh cream and garnish with a parsley leaf or chives and slightly toasted bread croutons in a pan with a drizzle of oil .
