instructions:
To prepare the potato and bell pepper frittata, start by placing a pot with plenty of water on the stove, which you will use for the Vegetable broth . Continue by cleaning the bell peppers: wash them well under plenty of fresh running water and dry them with paper towels. Remove the top part , then use a knife to remove the white filaments and seeds inside ; peel them using a vegetable peeler ,
then cut them into strips about 1/4 inch thick . Peel the potatoes and use a mandoline to cut slices about 1/8 inch thick .
Finely chop the shallot , sauté it in a large non-stick pan with the oil , then add the hot vegetable broth .
Add the sliced potatoes, seasoning with salt and pepper, and cook over medium heat for 3-4 minutes. Next, add the bell pepper strips and cook for another 7-8 minutes, stirring with a spatula .
In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, seasoning with salt and pepper (13-14), marjoram, and thyme ;
mix everything with the whisk to combine the ingredients well . When the vegetables are ready, add the beaten eggs and continue cooking for 10 minutes over low heat, covering with a lid .
After the necessary time , flip the frittata with the help of the lid and cook it on the other side for 2-3 minutes. Once ready, you can serve and enjoy your potato and bell pepper frittata .
You can store the potato and bell pepper frittata in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 1-2 days at most. Freezing is not recommended.
