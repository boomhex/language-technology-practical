instructions:
To prepare the veal skewers with arugula and scamorza, first pick only the leaves, detaching the stem part . Wash them under running water and then pat them dry with a kitchen towel .
Cut the scamorza into thin slices ; then pound the veal slices between two sheets of paper and remove any tendons. Lay one of the meat slices on the cutting board, place the scamorza slices on top
and cover with the arugula . Roll up the meat lengthwise to form a roll .
Insert 4 toothpicks on top of the roll to facilitate cutting and keep the filling in place. Divide the veal roll into 4 parts , gently remove the toothpicks
and insert them into a skewer stick, piercing the closed side of the meat slice . Do the same with the rest until all the meat is used up . Heat a pan with a few tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and place the veal skewers inside .
Cook them for 7 minutes, turning them halfway through . Salt and serve your veal skewers with arugula and scamorza.
Veal skewers with arugula and scamorza are perfect when freshly made. They can be stored for up to a day, sealed in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Freezing is not recommended.
For the veal skewers, you can use either sweet or smoked scamorza.
You can enrich the filling by also adding a slice of ham or speck inside the roll.
