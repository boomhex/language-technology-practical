Scallop crudo is a real delight from Calabria, Southern Italy—where, honestly, fresh seafood and zesty citrus totally rule. This scallop crudo really really shines, with a bright citrus marinade that highlights the tender sweetness of the scallops. You know, unlike those heavy baked dishes, folks in Calabria love keeping things light. Pretty simple. And look, incredibly fresh. The marinade combines juicy orange, zesty pink grapefruit, and that special bergamot—it's a staple along the southern coast. Plus, add a dash of pink pepper and a sprinkle of dill, and the colors just pop. It is the kind of seafood appetizer that looks fancy but is all about letting those top-quality scallops do their thing. Nothing is cooked here—seriously good—the seafood stays moist and cool, letting every citrusy note shine through with each bite.
For gatherings or special dinners, a plate of citrus scallop crudo feels like a mini celebration. I mean, guests really love how the crisp and tangy citrus dressing cuts through the rich scallop, making each bite feel extra lively. Calabria is renowned for its bergamot, and the hint of floral, almost spicy citrus gives this raw scallop recipe a unique twist. Compared to a classic scallop carpaccio or even a scallop ceviche, this dish is softer, more delicate—with just enough kick from pink pepper and herbiness from dill. It’s quick to prepare. And listen, it looks stunning with bright colors—a touch of green from the dill and a swirl of golden citrus oil on top. This easy seafood recipe is a favorite for Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve feasts in Southern Italy. Which is great. Everyone wants something light yet special to start the evening. A few bites of this dish and you'll see why Calabrian seafood traditions always emphasize great ingredients and simple flavors. Whether it’s the unique citrus notes or the elegant presentation, this dish is sure to impress and bring a taste of Calabria to your table.
