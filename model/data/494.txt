instructions:
To prepare octopuses in broth, first ensure your octopuses are already cleaned; rinse them under water and leave them in a colander. Peel the carrots and chop them finely . Peel the onion and chop it too , then peel the celery and chop it to the same size as the carrots and onions .
Cut a piece of chili pepper too , which will also be used for the soffritto. In a large pot, pour in the oil , add the soffritto and the chili pepper .
Let it infuse well, cooking over high heat. As soon as it starts to sizzle, add a pinch of salt. This way, the vegetables will release their liquid and the soffritto will not burn. After about 5 minutes, add the tomato paste and stir . Toast it for a couple of minutes, then add the octopuses .
Stir and cook them over high heat for a few minutes until they curl. When they are browned, remove the chili pepper and deglaze with the port and let the alcohol evaporate. Then add the peeled cherry tomatoes .
Cover with a lid and cook for 45-60 minutes, adding a bit of water, preferably warm, as needed. The octopuses should be very tender, and the sauce reduced to the right consistency . At this point, you can serve them .
Octopuses in broth can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days. Alternatively, you can freeze them.
Instead of peeled cherry tomatoes, you can use fresh tomatoes, tomato purée, or classic peeled tomatoes. Instead of Port, you can use a classic red or white wine.
