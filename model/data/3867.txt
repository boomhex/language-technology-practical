Next, add all the mantis shrimp: the chopped meat and the whole ones to the sautéed shallot and deglaze with the white wine ,
then, when it has evaporated, add the tomato puree . Gently stir and let the sauce thicken, being careful not to break the whole mantis shrimp. Finally, salt and add a few basil leaves . Cook the strozzapreti in plenty of salted water , drain them, and toss them in the mantis shrimp sauce for a few moments. Serve by garnishing each plate with a whole mantis shrimp and a few basil leaves.
