Looking to bring a touch of Northern Italy into your kitchen? This spinach potato torte is really just the thing. Originating from the beautiful areas of Lombardy and Piedmont , this dish isn’t your usual casserole. Really, it's not. The base is a soft layer of mashed potatoes, feeling so tender and cozy—perfect for comfort. And on top? You’ve got a mix of sautéed spinach and radicchio, which is great, bringing both sweet and tangy flavors. Even if veggies are not your thing, this combo might just win you over. And for real.
What sets this potato torte apart is its finish. Thin potato slices on top turn crispy and golden in the oven. Seriously good. This blend of soft and crisp creates a bite that’s rich, comforting and not too heavy. Plus, Italian home cooks often swap in local ingredients like porcini mushrooms, provola cheese, or even broccoli—depends on what's in season. It's really a great example of Italian home cooking —using what you have to create something delicious.
In Lombardy , some folks serve this as a main dish, while others cut it into little squares as an appetizer. And you know what? Its versatility is one of its strengths. The mild potatoes balance out the tangy radicchio, while the spinach adds that fresh, green taste. A sprinkle of grated cheese melts in, making everything extra moist and savory. For those hesitant about veggies, a slice of radicchio potato torte or spinach and radicchio tart might just change your mind—it’s really that good. Really, it is. Each bite offers a mix of tender potato, flavorful greens, and that crispy potato crust on top. Whether you call it a savory potato pie , a potato crust tart , or just a super tasty Italian comfort food, this dish pairs well with so many meals. People keep coming back to it because it’s easy to adapt, always satisfying, and showcases the best in simple, humble veggies. Can't go wrong.
To prepare the potato, spinach, and radicchio cakes, first boil the potatoes starting from cold salted water for about 30-40 minutes or until tender . Meanwhile, prepare the filling: clean the radicchio and cut it first into strips and then into chunks .
Peel and chop the onion . Place the onion in a large pan with a drizzle of hot oil and sauté for a few minutes. Once the onion is translucent, add the radicchio .
Add the spinach as well and cook over medium heat for about ten minutes. When the spinach is wilted and the radicchio is softened, salt and pepper. Transfer everything to a bowl and let it cool slightly, then add the eggs .
Add the grated cheese and season with nutmeg , then mix well to combine everything.
At this point, the potatoes will be cooked, so peel them and mash them with a potato masher into a bowl . Add the butter and flour .
Salt and pepper , then stir well to obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Proceed to assembly: butter 4 dishes and spread the potato mixture on the bottom and sides . Pour the filling inside and cover with more potato mixture, sealing the edges well .
At this point, peel the potatoes for the top and cut them into slices 1/12 inch thick . Place the potatoes on top of the cakes , salt, and garnish with thyme leaves .
Finally, drizzle with a little oil . Place the dishes on a baking sheet and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 25-30 minutes. When the top is crispy and golden, take them out and serve your potato, spinach, and radicchio cakes piping hot !
Potato, spinach, and radicchio cakes can be stored in the fridge for 2 days, covered with plastic wrap.
If you prefer, you can make the potato, spinach, and radicchio cakes in smaller molds, like muffin tins, to turn them into a tasty appetizer, or use a larger baking dish as a single mold.
