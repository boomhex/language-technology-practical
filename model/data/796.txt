instructions:
To prepare the risotto with bacon and pea cream, start by placing the pot with Vegetable broth on the heat, which will need to be hot to cook the rice. Continue by cleaning and finely chopping the onion . Then, cut the bacon into strips and move to the stove. In a saucepan, pour the bacon and add a drizzle of oil .
Sauté over high heat and when the bacon becomes crispy, set it aside . In the cooking fat, now add the chopped onion and stew for a couple of minutes over high heat . Then add half of the peas .
Pour in a ladleful of broth and adjust the salt, letting it cook for about 5 minutes. Transfer everything to the bowl of an immersion blender and blend until you get a smooth puree .
In a saucepan, melt 1.5 tbsp (20 g) of butter and immediately add the rice : to toast it, it will be enough to stir for a couple of minutes until the grains become hot and slightly lightened. The next step is to occasionally wet the rice with the hot broth, making sure to cover it a palm's depth above the rice and stir occasionally .
When there are only a few minutes left at the end of cooking, pour in the pea puree and then the remaining whole peas ; complete the cooking. Turn off the heat and add 1.5 tbsp (20 g) of butter .
Also add 2/3 of the sautéed bacon and mix. Plate by pouring a spoonful of bacon over the surface of each dish . Here is the risotto with bacon and pea cream ready.
It is recommended to consume the risotto with bacon and pea cream immediately.
A sprinkle of grated cheese or Pecorino Romano is definitely the extra touch to this delight!
