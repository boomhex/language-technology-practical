To prepare the star wreath, start with the cocoa and hazelnut shortcrust pastry: place the sifted flour and cold butter from the fridge in pieces in the mixer ; activate it to create a sandy mixture, then add the hazelnut flour and let the blades run again. Transfer the obtained mixture onto a work surface and create the classic fountain shape: place the egg in the center .
Then cut a vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds with the blade of a knife . Pour them in the center of the fountain; also add the powdered sugar and hazelnut paste and start mixing quickly , until you get a compact and smooth consistency.
Dust the shortcrust dough with sifted cocoa powder and mix it into the dough . Now that you have obtained a smooth and compact dough, flatten it slightly and wrap it in plastic wrap : let it rest for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.
After the necessary time, take the shortcrust dough and roll it out to a thickness of 0.4 inches on a lightly floured work surface . Then cut out with large, medium, and small star-shaped cutters (11-12). You can quickly re-knead the shortcrust and continue until the dough is used up.
Take a baking sheet, brush it with butter, and line it with parchment paper (this way the parchment paper will adhere perfectly); draw a circle of 9 inches in diameter, then start placing the stars alternating the large and medium ones with the small ones in between (13-14-15). Place everything in the refrigerator to firm up for about 15 minutes, so they hold their shape well during baking.
Bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 15 minutes (if using a convection oven, you can test by baking one star of each size and better adjust with time and temperature, usually 20°F less and 8-10 minutes less than the static oven). When the stars are cooked , gently transfer them to a rack to cool completely . Meanwhile, prepare the royal icing: in a bowl, place the egg whites and start beating them with an electric mixer .
Then gradually add the sifted powdered sugar and 2 drops of lemon, until a fluid consistency is obtained . Transfer the icing into a disposable piping bag without a tip, where you can make a small hole at the tip .
Once they are completely cold, decorate the stars by outlining the border (22-23) or creating the decorations you prefer for your star centerpiece !
Store the star centerpiece for 4-5 days under a glass dome or in a tin box.
You can freeze the raw shortcrust wrapped in plastic wrap and store for a month.
With these quantities, you will obtain two centerpieces. If you prefer, you can vary one of the two by opting for other biscuit shapes!
