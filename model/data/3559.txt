First, grill the peppers directly over the coals until the skin is burned ; they should have a soft yet still crunchy texture. Place in a container, cover with plastic wrap, and let them sweat. This process will make it easier to remove the pepper's skin. Then peel them and remove the seeds and internal filaments .
Cut the peppers into strips , then roast the garlic cloves as well (5-6), peel them
and then chop . In a container, put the sliced peppers, chopped capers, and garlic (8-9), and pour in three of the five tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper to taste. Let it rest.
Set up the kettle for indirect cooking. Preheat to 320°F. Soak cherry chips in water for at least 30 minutes, place them in a disposable aluminum tray, cover with aluminum foil, make a few holes, and place directly on the hot coals. Position the sausage on the grill away from the heat source, close the kettle lid, and let it smoke for 40 minutes until the sausages have a deep ruby color . Prepare the sauce by mixing the mustard, the remaining oil, and honey, trying to emulsify everything (11-12).
Grill the bread slice , lay the pepper salad on top, place the luganega, and spoon over some sweet and sour mustard sauce .
If you do not have a barbecue, you can also prepare the toast with luganega and smoked peppers in the oven.
