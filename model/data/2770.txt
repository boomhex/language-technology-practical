Add the chopped red chili pepper . Cook for 10 minutes over high heat. Now drain the red beans (precooked) from their preserving water (if using dried beans, you will need to soak them in water for 12 hours and then boil them) and pour them into the pan with the vegetables . Continue cooking for a couple of minutes: the vegetables should not fall apart but remain crunchy. Then remove the clove of garlic and let them cool.
