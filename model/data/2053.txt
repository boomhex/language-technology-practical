To make the Naples Copper Cookies, melt the margarine in a double boiler or microwave and set aside. Pour the sugar, cloves , and ground cinnamon into a large bowl. Add the baking powder
Then add the unsweetened cocoa powder and flavor the dough by grating the orange zest , being careful to avoid the white part of the peel, which would be bitter. Pour in the honey and melted margarine .
Mix the mixture with a spatula to blend it , separately sift the flour and incorporate it into the dough, one tablespoon at a time .
Also add the milk, alternating with the flour , mixing to obtain a well-blended mixture . Now shape the cookies: line a baking sheet with parchment paper, then take a spoonful of dough and form a ball by sliding the dough onto the tray with the help of another spoon ; be sure to space the cookies apart because they will expand during baking.
Once the cookies are completed , bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 15 minutes. Once baked, remove the cookies and let them cool . In the meantime, prepare the coating: chop the dark chocolate with a knife
Place it in a saucepan for double boiling , add the margarine and heat over moderate heat until the mixture has completely melted .
Take the cookies that have cooled, brush the surface with orange marmalade , dip them in chocolate , and place them on a wire rack
Cover them with chopped pistachios , let the glaze dry for about 2 hours , then enjoy your Naples Copper Cookies .
