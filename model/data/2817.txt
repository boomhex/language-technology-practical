Insalata primavera really captures the heart of Northern Italy when spring hits— fresh vegetables , formaggi freschi , and those bright flavors coming together like a dream. Picture this: biting into the salad and feeling the crunchy goodness of taccole and green beans. So satisfying. Plus, the tender zucchini slices and confit cherry tomatoes? They burst with sweet and tangy delight. And the sauce? That's where the magic happens. It's creamy Dijon mustard and yogurt—just brings everything together.
You’ll find these verdure di stagione in bustling markets of Lombardy or Piedmont. They make dishes taste so much like spring in Italy—seriously good. What makes this salad really special is the mix of textures, especially with the fried zucchini flowers. Stuffed with cheese and anchovies—they add a crispy, rich touch that’s way better than your usual insalata mista .

Each bite gives you a glimpse into how Northern Italians celebrate spring—mixing the best verdure di stagione with local cheeses. And a few tasty surprises. Whether it’s part of a casual meal or the star of the show, this salad really captures the joyful spirit of Italian spring cuisine. The way these ingredients come together not only shows off the region's love for fresh produce but also its knack for creating dishes that are both simple and refined, just perfect for sharing with friends and family. Pretty simple, pretty amazing.
To prepare the spring salad with vegetables and cheeses, first prepare the confit cherry tomatoes following our recipe which you can find by clicking Cherry Tomatoes Confit . While the cherry tomatoes are cooking, wash the vegetables and trim the ends of the green beans and snap peas; separate the baby zucchini from the zucchini flowers and remove the internal pistils and stem; keep 4 whole and cut the remaining ones into strips .
Also trim the ends of the zucchini and slice them lengthwise . In a steaming pot, heat the water with the aromatic herbs , place the steamer basket on top, and add the snap peas , cook for a few minutes as the snap peas should remain crunchy, once cooked drain them and set them aside.
Proceed in the same way by cooking the green beans ; then move on to the baby zucchini . After cooking the vegetables, take the Tilsit cheese, cut 4 sticks, and reduce the rest to cubes .
Then proceed with the preparation of the batter, pour the cold sparkling water into a bowl , sift the flour inside , mix the compound with a whisk, then add the salt and baking soda .
Take the whole zucchini flowers you set aside, fill half of them with anchovy fillets and the other half with Tilsit sticks . Close the zucchini flowers by gently rolling the leaves to seal the filling. Carefully coat the stuffed zucchini flowers in flour ,
then in the batter , and finally fry them in plenty of peanut oil: for optimal frying, the oil temperature should be kept constantly at about 340°F. Cook the zucchini flowers until golden, then drain them and place them on a tray lined with absorbent paper. At this point, start assembling the salad: place the steamed vegetables in a dish, then add thinly sliced carrots using a vegetable peeler ,
the confit cherry tomatoes and Tilsit cubes . To add flavor, take the Grana Padano and thinly slice it into flakes with a vegetable peeler . Now that the salad is ready, prepare the accompanying sauce: in a small bowl combine Dijon mustard, honey ,
classic mustard , lemon juice, and yogurt ; mix the ingredients with a teaspoon and garnish your salad with the sauce (you can serve the rest of the sauce separately). Place the stuffed zucchini flowers on top .
Store the salad without dressing in the refrigerator for a couple of days. It is advisable to consume the fried zucchini flowers immediately. You can freeze the salad only if you have used fresh ingredients that haven't been previously frozen. Store the sauce in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for a maximum of a couple of days.
The spring vegetable salad is a rich dish that you can flavor with the tastiest ingredients such as olives or sun-dried tomatoes instead of confit cherry tomatoes!
