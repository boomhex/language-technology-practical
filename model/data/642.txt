To prepare pappardelle with porcini mushrooms, first start with the fresh pasta: place the flour in a mound on the work surface, place the eggs and a pinch of salt in the center. Start mixing with a fork , then begin kneading by hand: you will need to work the dough by pulling and folding it on itself for about 10-15 minutes with energy, until it is elastic and homogeneous . If it turns out not perfectly smooth, don't worry: after resting, it will become so.
Let it rest for 30 minutes , you can wrap it in plastic wrap and store in a cool, dry place (or in the fridge, only if the temperature in the house is very high). Meanwhile, clean the porcini mushrooms, remove the soil and impurities first by gently scraping with a small knife , then with a dry cloth or, if there is a lot of soil, slightly moistened .
Separate the stems from the cap , then slice everything and set aside .
Retrieve the fresh pasta, take a portion and keep the rest under the plastic wrap so it does not dry out. Roll it out with the rolling pin or pasta maker to a thickness of 0.02 inches . Divide the obtained sheet into smaller strips , lightly flour them and roll the edges towards the center until they meet .
Turn so that the sheet is rolled lengthwise in front of you and, with a sharp knife, cut into 1 inch thickness . Then lift the obtained rolls and place the nests of pappardelle one by one on a tray lined with parchment paper and lightly floured with semolina . Set aside.
Prepare the sauce: place a pat of butter in a pan , add the garlic and parsley stems . Sauté over medium heat, add the porcini , salt, pepper, and cook for 5-6 minutes over high heat.
Add hot water if they dry out too much and, at the end of cooking, remove the parsley stems . Boil the pappardelle in salted water to taste for a couple of minutes .
Drain the pappardelle into the pan , finish with a pat of butter and season with parsley .
Add Parmigiano Reggiano to taste and mix . Serve the pappardelle with porcini mushrooms hot .
Pappardelle with porcini mushrooms can be stored for one day in the refrigerator. The porcini sauce can be stored for a couple of days in the refrigerator.
You can freeze the pappardelle raw. For freezing, place the pasta nests spaced out on a tray and then put them in the freezer to harden for a couple of hours. Once well hardened, put them in freezer bags and store them back in the freezer. When you need them, boil them directly from frozen in boiling water and proceed as per the recipe.
Do not wash the mushrooms under running water; otherwise, they will absorb moisture and lose their firm texture.
