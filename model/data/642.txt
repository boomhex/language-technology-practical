instructions:
To prepare the artichoke zeppole, first of all, take care of cleaning them. Remove the outer leaves , then with a knife trim them and also cut the stem .
Cut the artichokes in half and with a small knife remove the inner fuzz . Then cut them into fairly thin slices .
As you go, place the artichokes in acidulated water to prevent them from blackening . Drizzle a little oil in a pan and transfer the well-drained artichokes inside . Sauté on high heat for 5 minutes, then season with salt, lower the heat and cook for another 5 minutes . Allow them to cool completely, then cover the artichokes and set them aside.
Now prepare the batter for the zeppole. Pour the flour into a bowl . In another bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and pour everything into the flour .
Mix with a whisk until you obtain a smooth batter. Finally, add the salt and cover with cling film .
Let it rise for an hour . After this time, add the artichokes and mix very gently .
Heat plenty of seed oil in a high-sided pot, as soon as it's hot, using two spoons, take an amount of batter the size of a walnut and let it slide into the oil . Immerse a few pieces at a time to avoid lowering the oil's temperature too much .
Turn the zeppole occasionally until they are well golden . Drain them with a slotted spoon , transfer them to a tray lined with absorbent paper to remove excess oil and continue this way with the cooking of the others. Serve the artichoke zeppole while still hot!
We recommend consuming the zeppole immediately.
Alternatively, you can store them in the refrigerator and heat them in the oven before serving.
If you prefer, you can use 1 g of dry yeast.
