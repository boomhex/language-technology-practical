To prepare the cod with sun-dried tomato paste, start by cleaning the Tropea onion: remove the ends and the outer layer of the onion, then cut it in half and finally into very thin slices .
Transfer the onion slices to a bowl with ice water, this way it will retain its crunchiness . Take the sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drain them, and cut them into pieces , then finely chop them with a knife until you get a paste .
Now pour the oil into a non-stick pan and heat it over medium-high heat, then slightly lower the heat and add the cod : cook for about 6 minutes without turning it, rotating the pan to distribute the oil evenly and prevent the pieces from sticking to the bottom . After this time, gently turn the cod with a spatula and let it cook for another 6 minutes over medium heat . In the meantime, drain the red onion and dry it with kitchen paper.
Once cooked, transfer the cod to plates, placing it on a base of chopped sun-dried tomatoes, then add a few slices of raw onion, a sprinkle of black pepper , and a drizzle of raw oil : your cod with sun-dried tomato paste is ready to be served !
It is recommended to serve the cod with sun-dried tomato paste immediately. Freezing is not recommended.
Worried about the raw onion? Cook it in a pan with water and cane sugar to obtain delicious Caramelized Tropea Onions , which will pair perfectly with the intense flavor of the sun-dried tomatoes. It's not necessary to salt the cod: the sun-dried tomatoes in oil are already very flavorful!
