instructions:
To prepare the pasta salad with pears, bacon, and walnuts, you can first start cooking the pasta . Meanwhile, cut the bacon into slices, then into strips ,
sear it in a non-stick pan for about 3 minutes over high heat (without adding extra fats) and once it's ready, when it becomes nice and crispy, place it on a tray lined with paper towels . Then wash the pears and cut them in half first ,
then core them and, without peeling, cut them into wedges, and finally into cubes . Roughly chop the walnuts and once the pasta is al dente, drain it and transfer it into a large bowl. Pour in a tablespoon of oil and mix so that the pasta doesn't stick together as it cools. Let it cool down.
Once it is cold, add the pears , chopped thyme , and a sprinkle of pink pepper .
Salt to taste , then also add the crispy bacon and chopped walnut kernels . Finally, cut the Pecorino into chunks
and add it to the bowl with the pasta along with all the dressing. Mix well so that all the ingredients are combined and your pasta salad with pears, bacon, and walnuts will be ready to serve!
It is preferable to consume the pasta salad with pears, bacon, and walnuts right after preparation, otherwise you can store it for a maximum of one day in the refrigerator, closed in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you want to make your pasta salad even more appetizing and flavorful, you can add sliced almonds!
