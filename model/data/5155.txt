Pears in red wine are desserts with intense flavors, a more refined version of the rustic cooked pears from grandma. In this recipe, in addition to typical winter spices like cinnamon, cloves, and star anise, the pears are cooked in a red wine that makes them even more aromatic and fragrant. Among the quick and easy spoon desserts, this recipe is undoubtedly one of the easiest and fastest, perfect as an after-meal treat, especially in the colder months. Those with a sweet tooth can also try the recipe for pears with wine and chocolate , while those who love to experiment at the table can try pears as an appetizer with our recipe for baked pears with gorgonzola, perfect for fans of sweet and savory flavors!
To prepare the pears in red wine, start with the syrup: pour the wine , water , and sugar into a saucepan (the ideal size for the pears to cook well is a diameter of 8 inches).
Then add all the spices and turn on medium heat. Peel the pears leaving the stem and add them to the pot . Let them cook on medium heat for at least 20 minutes.
Once the pears are cooked , remove them and set them aside . Let the syrup reduce on high heat for about 10 minutes .
When it is reduced and thick, put the pears back in the pot with the heat off and let them get well covered in sauce . Serve the pears in red wine hot or warm .
Pears in red wine keep in the refrigerator for 2 days. We do not recommend freezing.
For this recipe, we recommend a still red wine like Pinot Noir, Merlot, or Barbera.
Serve the pears in red wine with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
