instructions:
To prepare the whole wheat sponge cake, first pour the eggs into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Add the brown sugar , salt , and honey .
Also add the lemon zest, taking only the yellow part , and turn the machine to medium speed for about 15 minutes. You should obtain a fluffy, light, and frothy mixture . Turn off the machine and sift the whole wheat flour directly into the mixture .
Gently mix from bottom to top with a whisk . Once you have an even mixture, transfer it into a 9-inch mold lined with parchment paper . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 45 minutes.
Always perform the toothpick test before removing the cake from the oven . Without burning yourself, immediately turn it over onto a wire rack and let it cool completely. Then remove the mold and use your whole wheat sponge cake .
The whole wheat sponge cake can be kept for 3 days in the refrigerator, wrapped in plastic wrap. It can be frozen after baking.
If you prefer, you can flavor the sponge cake with half a vanilla bean and choose a more aromatic type of honey.
