instructions:
To make the capù, first wash and chop the parsley . In a bowl, add the ground meat, the whole egg , then add the grated cheese
and the breadcrumbs , salt, pepper , and finally season with the chopped parsley .
Mix with a fork to combine the mixture and set aside. Now, remove the cabbage leaves and choose the largest and most intact ones . Blanch the cabbage leaves for 3-4 minutes ,
then drain and carefully dry them on a towel . Cut the leaf in the center . Take a ball of mixture weighing about 3 oz , and place it on one side of the leaf .
Wrap one edge and then the other, to completely close the roll . At this point, wrap the rolls with kitchen twine .
Now, prepare the sauce: peel and thinly slice the onion . Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the onion , and let it brown for 5 minutes over moderate heat, then add the diced bacon .
Cook for another couple of minutes, then pour in the tomato pulp , salt, and place the cabbage rolls inside . Cook for 30-40 minutes covered .
Halfway through cooking, turn the rolls with a spoon . Once the capù are ready , serve them hot .
The capù can be stored in the refrigerator for 1 day. It is possible to freeze them if fresh ingredients have been used.
One of the variations of this recipe includes the use of cooked cotechino, but versions with beef are also common. As an alternative to cabbage, you can use Swiss chard, following the same procedure.
