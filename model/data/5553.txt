instructions:
Vanilla pudding is a classic and simple spoon dessert that can be enjoyed on its own or with the addition of whipped cream, fresh seasonal fruit, fruit coulis, or various sweet sauces. Vanilla pudding is made with milk, cream, sugar, eggs, vanilla, and gelatin sheets; before serving, it needs to be refrigerated for at least 4 hours to solidify, and only then can it be unmolded and garnished as desired.

To make vanilla pudding, start by softening the gelatin sheets in a bowl of cold water for 15 minutes . Split the vanilla bean in half and scrape out the seeds using a knife; in a saucepan, pour the milk and cream and add the vanilla bean and seeds. Place the saucepan on the stove and bring the ingredients slowly to the point of boiling .
Turn off the heat, strain the mixture into a bowl to remove the vanilla bean and any residues , then add the well-wrung gelatin sheets and stir until completely dissolved. In a high-sided bowl, pour the egg yolks and sugar; using a whisk, combine them and then, while still stirring, add the liquid milk and cream mixture . Pour the resulting mixture into a mold and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving. When it's time to unmold the pudding, immerse the mold for a few seconds in boiling water and then unmold the pudding by inverting it onto a serving plate. Decorate the vanilla pudding with fresh fruit and dollops of whipped cream, or with sweet sauces or anything else you like.
You can make the vanilla pudding in a single mold or in four individual molds.
