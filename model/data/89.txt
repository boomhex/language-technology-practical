instructions:
To prepare the vegan upside-down apple cake, first make the caramel: pour the sugar into a heavy-bottomed saucepan and let it melt over low heat until it becomes amber-colored ; it will take about 10-15 minutes.
Meanwhile, clean the apples : cut 200 g of pulp into chunks and the rest into thin slices , which you will set aside.
Transfer the apple chunks into a jug, add the water , and blend with an immersion mixer to obtain a puree .
Pour the flour into a bowl and add the plant-based butter, which you will have melted earlier , and the apple puree . Mix well with a whisk, then add the sugar .
Mix again to obtain a homogeneous mixture . Now pour the hot caramel into a 8.66-inch diameter mold at the base and 9.84 inches at the top , then arrange the apple slices to cover the entire bottom .
Sprinkle the apples with cinnamon , pine nuts , and coarsely chopped walnuts , making sure to set aside some nuts for decoration.
At this point, cover the apples with the batter and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 45 minutes . Check the baking with a toothpick, then take it out of the oven and immediately flip the cake with the help of a plate, being careful not to burn yourself .
Carefully remove the mold and let it cool. Garnish the surface with the reserved pine nuts and walnuts and serve your vegan upside-down apple cake !
The vegan upside-down apple cake can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
You can freeze it after it has been baked and completely cooled.
You can prepare the cake batter while the caramel is cooking as suggested in the recipe, or prepare the caramel just before pouring it into the mold... the important thing is to keep it warm to prevent it from solidifying. For the same reason, it is necessary to flip and unmold the cake while it is still hot, before the caramel cools.
If you prefer, you can replace the cinnamon with citrus zest.
