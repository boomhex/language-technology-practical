instructions:
To prepare the buckwheat spaghetti with anchovies and cherry tomatoes, start by cleaning the fresh anchovies: after removing the head, cut along the back to remove the central bone and gut them. Rinse them well under running water and set aside . Score the skin of the cherry tomatoes .
Blanch them for a minute in boiling water , then transfer them to a bowl with ice water to cool them . At this point, remove the skin .
Cut the tomato pulp into quarters and set aside. Chop the stale bread in a food processor to make coarse crumbs.
In a non-stick pan, heat a little oil with half a clove of garlic , then add the chopped bread and toast it for 2-3 minutes until golden. Remove the garlic from the pan .
Transfer the bread back to the food processor along with the parsley . Roughly chop everything together . In another pan, heat a little oil and the remaining half of the clove of garlic .
Add the salted anchovies, which you previously desalted , and let them melt in the pan to create a flavorful base . Pour in the tomato pulp .
Sauté the cherry tomatoes for a few minutes to soften them , then add the fresh anchovies, saving a few for plating . Cook on low heat for 10-15 minutes until the sauce starts to thicken .
Meanwhile, cook the pasta al dente in salted boiling water . When there are a few minutes left for the pasta to be done, add a pinch of chili pepper, capers , and a handful of chopped parsley to the sauce. Drain the pasta and transfer it to the pan with the sauce .

Add a ladle of cooking water and stir to blend the flavors . Garnish the plates with the reserved anchovies and the toasted breadcrumbs . Your buckwheat spaghetti with anchovies and cherry tomatoes is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the buckwheat spaghetti with anchovies and cherry tomatoes immediately.
If you wish, you can add a grating of lemon zest just before serving for a touch of freshness: it will enhance the flavor of the anchovies and balance the dish's saltiness!
