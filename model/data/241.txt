Veal roast with Marsala sauce is a classic on many Sicilian holiday tables, especially for big gatherings like Christmas lunch. In Sicily, the meat is cooked slowly and gently, so every bite is tender and wonderfully moist. Really good stuff. The real star? Marsala wine , a sweet, rich drink from Sicily. It turns into a thick, velvety sauce. And look, this sauce gives the veal roast a deep, almost sweet flavor that soaks into the meat. Makes it feel extra special.
Thing is, those who know their veal marsala recipe tricks say preparing the meat in advance and storing it right keeps it soft and flavorful. Pretty much no worry about it drying out. Plus, the marsala sauce ties everything together with a bit of a tangy kick. So, it balances out the richness.
Across different parts of Italy, people might add their own touches—like wild herbs from their region or a different veal cut—but the main idea remains: keep it simple, and let the flavor of the veal roast and Marsala shine. And here's the thing, this dish isn't just for show; it's practical too. You can make it ahead, so there's no rush on the day of your dinner. Seriously good.
For anyone into Italian veal recipes or looking for new veal dinner ideas, this meal is perfect for a crowd. Doesn’t need a lot of fancy stuff. The golden brown crust on the outside, combined with the juicy, tender inside and the smooth marsala wine sauce —which is awesome—sets it apart from other veal roast cooking methods. I mean, people often serve it with simple sides like roasted potatoes or green beans. Letting that amazing, silky sauce do the heavy lifting.
In the end, veal roast with marsala feels both simple and classy—easy enough to make but elegant enough to get people talking long after dinner's over. Can't go wrong.

To prepare the veal roast with Marsala, first peel and chop the garlic along with the sage leaves and rosemary needles . Take the already tied roast, salt it , pepper it, and coat it with the aromatic mixture .
Massage the meat well with your hands to flavor it on all sides . In a saucepan, heat the butter along with a drizzle of oil .
When the butter is melted, place the meat in the pan and brown it well on all sides ; it will take 5-10 minutes. Once the meat is well browned, transfer it to a baking dish and collect the cooking juices in a bowl . Removing the fat part will give you a lighter sauce.
Deglaze the pan with the Marsala and white wine . Let it cook for a few minutes until the alcoholic part has evaporated .
Pour the cooking juices over the meat , cover with aluminum foil , and bake for an hour and a half in a preheated static oven at 356°F, or until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 158°F-167°F. At this point, remove the roast from the oven .
Transfer the meat to a platter and let it rest for 5 minutes, covering it with a sheet of aluminum foil. Strain the cooking juices directly into a saucepan. In a separate bowl, pour the cornstarch and water .
Stir well to dissolve the starch , add it to the cooking juices , and cook for a few more minutes until it reaches a boil .
You should get a thicker sauce, but still quite liquid . If you plan to serve the roast immediately, remove the string from the meat and slice it , then serve with the sauce.
If you want to serve it the next day, transfer the roast slices back to the pan and sprinkle them with the reheated sauce to make it liquid again . Cover with a sheet of aluminum foil and heat everything in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 15-20 minutes. After this time, all that's left is to serve your veal roast with Marsala, perhaps accompanied by some Roasted potatoes !
The cooked veal roast with Marsala can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. The best way to keep it tender is to separate the meat from its sauce, let it cool completely, and then place it in an airtight container. You can also freeze it for 1-2 months this way.
Once you've massaged the meat with salt, pepper, and herbs, if you have time, you can leave it in the fridge for up to 12 hours. Choose dry Marsala, not sweet, and always combine it with white wine. One will give the aromatic part, the other the acidity. Otherwise, if you don't want to use alcohol, you can use beef broth and orange juice.
