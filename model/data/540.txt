instructions:
To make iced madeleines, first melt the butter in a saucepan and allow it to cool. Meanwhile, sift the powdered sugar and baking powder into a bowl, then add the grated lemon zest .
Mix with a hand whisk , then add the eggs, one at a time . Mix to combine them, being careful not to incorporate air. Sift the flour into the bowl in 2 parts and incorporate it with the whisk.
Add a pinch of salt . Finally, pour in the melted butter and quickly mix the batter. Cover with plastic wrap and let the batter rest in the refrigerator for about an hour and a half .
After the resting time, butter a madeleine mold and fill it with the batter using 2 spoons (alternatively you can use a piping bag) . Do not overfill the molds as they will rise during baking . Bake the madeleines in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 11-12 minutes. Once baked, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely in the mold .
While the madeleines cool, you can prepare the glaze: pour the strained lemon juice and powdered sugar into a small bowl , then mix until you obtain a medium-thick glaze . Adjust the lemon amount according to the desired consistency.
At this point, dip the smooth side of the madeleines in the glaze and place them back in the mold. Garnish with grated lemon zest and let them dry. Your iced madeleines are ready to be served !
Iced madeleines can be stored at room temperature for 2-3 days in an airtight container.
You can freeze them after baking.
If desired, you can add or substitute orange zest for the lemon zest.
Adjust the glaze consistency by adding more powdered sugar or lemon juice, depending on whether you want it thicker or thinner.
If you prefer, you can cover the madeleines with a delicious Chocolate glaze instead of lemon!
