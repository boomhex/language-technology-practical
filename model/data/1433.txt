instructions:
To prepare the Scammaro omelette, first put a pot of salted water on the stove and bring it to a boil, which will be used to cook the pasta. Peel the garlic and slice it thinly . Also, slice the fresh chili thinly and chop the anchovies into pieces after draining them well from their preservation oil.
Slice the pitted black olives into rounds and chop the parsley . Soak the raisins in warm water for a few minutes .
Once the water boils, add the pasta and cook it al dente for about 7 minutes. Take a 12-inch diameter pan, heat the olive oil, add the garlic , chili, and anchovies . Sauté for a moment over medium heat, just enough to dissolve the anchovies.
Then add the olives and desalted capers . Finally, add the well-drained raisins . Continue cooking for a couple of minutes, just enough to blend all the aromas and flavors.
Drain the pasta directly into the pan , season with the freshly chopped parsley and stir to flavor .
Now cook the omelette for 6 minutes, then place a plate on top , flip it over and continue cooking for another 6 minutes: you should get a golden crust on the surface . The Scammaro omelette is ready to be served!
Store the Scammaro omelette in the refrigerator and consume it within a couple of days at most.
Other variations of this tasty omelette include the addition of pine nuts and fresh cherry tomatoes. If you want a thicker omelette, just use a pan with a diameter of about 10.5 inches.
