Add them to the bowl with eggs and sugar and start to beat with a mixer until you get a frothy and pale mixture . Gradually add the room temperature milk and then the oil while lowering the speed .
Slowly incorporate the flour mixed with baking powder while continuing to whisk at low speed , you should obtain a smooth, lump-free mixture . Butter a 10-inch Bundt pan
and pour half of the batter inside . Add 1.5 oz of dark chocolate and 1.5 oz of white chocolate cut into chunks . Cover with the remaining batter
and add another 1.5 oz of dark chocolate and another 1.5 oz of white chocolate . Bake at 356°F for 45 minutes. Then take it out of the oven , let it cool, then remove it from the pan and transfer it to a serving plate.
