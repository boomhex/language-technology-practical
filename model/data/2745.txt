To create the berry aspic, start by washing and drying the blueberries , strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, and white currants. Remove the stems from the strawberries and slice half of them into rounds and cut the other half in half .
Separately, place the gelatin sheets in a bowl with cold water for 10 minutes or until they have softened. Meanwhile, warm 50 ml of Moscato and pour it into a bowl . Drain the gelatin sheets well using a sieve and squeeze them.
Dissolve them in the bowl with the warm Moscato, add the sugar, and stir with a spatula to obtain a smooth, lump-free mixture. Now pour in the remaining wine at room temperature, add the strained lemon juice, and mix the mixture. Take pudding molds with a capacity of 5.6 oz each, pour 0.7 oz of liquid into each mold and let them set in the fridge for at least 15 minutes or until the gelatin has firmed up. After the indicated time, take the molds, place a mint leaf and a strawberry slice in the center ,
fill the entire edge around with blueberries . Cover with the Moscato (about 0.5 oz) and place back in the fridge to set for another 15 minutes. Then continue by placing the strawberry wedges vertically with the cut side facing the mold's perimeter and 4 raspberries with the wider part facing outward : place a blueberry in the center and cover with liquid, then put them back in the fridge for 15 minutes.
When the gelatin has solidified, arrange a layer of white currants , then cover again with the Moscato-based liquid and place the molds in the fridge for another 15 minutes. Finish with a final layer of blueberries and let the aspics rest in the fridge for at least 3 hours before serving. When it's time to unmold them, dip them for a few seconds in a bowl of boiling water and then help yourself by running the tip of a knife around the edge and turning them onto a plate. Garnish your berry aspics with mint leaves and a few leftover berries and serve them!
You can store the berry aspic in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
The version we propose is made with berries, but of course, you can prepare aspics with any fruit you like. However, avoid kiwi, which contains an enzyme that prevents the setting process. If you don't like white currants because they're too sour or can't find them, no problem: use blackberries or diced strawberries instead. If you have children at the table, Moscato is probably not the most suitable liquid for gelling... you can replace it with a filtered fruit juice, preferably clear, keeping in mind that, for obvious reasons, the gelatin will be less transparent.
