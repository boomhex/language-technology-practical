instructions:
First, prepare the pizza dough with the quantities indicated above and following the procedure you can find Pizza dough Let it rise in a warm, dry place for about 2 hours, until the dough has doubled in volume. Once the dough has risen, start preparing the vegetable filling by washing and finely chopping (julienne style) various types of vegetables; we used zucchini, eggplants, carrots, and bell peppers . Place them in a pan with a tablespoon of oil and sauté them for a few minutes over high heat, adding salt and pepper . Cut the mozzarella into cubes and place it on a colander to drain the excess water.
For the classic filling, season 100 ml of tomato puree with oil and salt , cut the mozzarella into cubes, draining it well, and the cooked ham into small pieces. Roll out the dough on a work surface into rectangles about 7 inches wide and 1/12 inch thick . Place the filling in small heaps in the center of the rectangle (with the quantities of the recipe, you will have 10 mini calzones with tomato, mozzarella, and ham, and 10 with vegetables and mozzarella).
Lift the dough from one side and cover the filling by overlapping it on the other side . Use a pasta cutter with a diameter of 4 inches or a glass to cut the calzones into half-moons and use the tines of a fork to press the edge to seal it . Lightly brush the mini calzones with oil and bake them in a convection oven at 450°F for 10/15 minutes. The baked mini calzones should be served hot, but be careful not to burn yourself with the filling!
