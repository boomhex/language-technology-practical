instructions:
To prepare the rum custard cream, first pour the milk into a saucepan, add the lemon zest and bring it to a boil over low heat, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, in another saucepan, pour the egg yolks, add the sugar , beat with a whisk, and also incorporate the cornstarch .
Mix with a whisk until you have obtained a smooth and homogeneous mixture. Add the salt , mix again, and as soon as the milk starts to boil, slowly pour it into the egg yolk mixture , continuing to stir.
As soon as you have incorporated all the milk, place on the heat , add the rum, and mix . Then remove the lemon zest
and continue to stir until it thickens . It will take just a few minutes. At this point, transfer to a bowl . To quickly lower the temperature of the cream, place the bowl inside another bowl with ice water, stirring continuously. Cover with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator until ready to serve the cream. Before transferring it into cups or using it, we recommend lightly beating it with a whisk.
You can store the rum cream in the refrigerator for 3 days.
Flavor the cream also with orange zest or cinnamon!
