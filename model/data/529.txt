instructions:
To prepare fresh beetroot pasta, drain the pre-cooked beetroot to remove any liquids . Cut it into pieces and place it in a cup , blend finely with an immersion blender .
Set aside the obtained puree . Place the flour on a work surface . To make the well in the center more easily and precisely, you can use the base of a bowl .
Once the space is created , pour the beetroot puree and the two eggs inside.
Use a fork to start mixing the ingredients initially without taking additional flour , then gradually begin to gather more and more flour, and when the dough is sufficiently dry, continue by hand and knead until it is smooth and homogeneous, being careful not to tear it to avoid ruining the gluten structure. If necessary, add more flour as needed. Once a ball is formed , cover it and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. With a dough scraper, cut half of the dough . (You can keep the other half covered with plastic wrap so it doesn't dry out).
You can roll it out with a rolling pin or with a pasta machine to make the formats you prefer. We have prepared tagliatelle, rolling it with a rolling pin on a work surface sprinkled with semolina (or slightly floured). Roll out the dough as thinly as possible ; if you use the pasta roller, go to the penultimate thickness, sprinkle with semolina and let it dry for a few minutes. Even out the edges to create a rectangle .
Roll up the dough , cut strips about 1/4 inch thick , and form the classic nests .
You can freeze the fresh beetroot pasta while raw, in the various chosen formats.
For freezing, place the pasta formats well spaced on a tray and then place them in the freezer to harden for a couple of hours.
Once well hardened, put them in freezer bags and place them back in the freezer. They can be boiled directly from frozen.
If you want to use raw beetroot, you will first need to clean the beetroot well from soil residues: then you can peel it and blanch it or peel it and steam it, reducing it to chunks first, until completely softened.
