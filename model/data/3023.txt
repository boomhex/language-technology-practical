To prepare the cold lettuce meat rolls, start by removing the leaves from the head of lettuce : discard the tougher or damaged outer leaves and remove the base of the head. Wash and dry the lettuce leaves thoroughly under running water and with a small knife remove the central vein of the leaf , then cut it in half .
At this point, place 2 slices of carpaccio on each half leaf and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Drizzle a little oil over the seasoned slices and grate some lemon zest . If you like, you can spread a little mustard on the carpaccio slice. Now roll the stuffed lettuce leaf leaving the closure side down , so that the rolls do not unravel and fall apart. Your cold lettuce meat rolls are ready to be enjoyed! Remember to keep everything in the refrigerator until serving time.
To prepare the cold lettuce vegetable rolls, start by peeling a carrot and chopping it into rather small cubes . Then shell and wash the peas and boil them in a saucepan with the carrot cubes for about 10 minutes ; if using already shelled peas, you will need about 2.3 oz. Once cooked, drain them and save them in a bowl.
Separately, boil an egg in a saucepan and cook a potato; once the potato is boiled, peel it and cut it into cubes and when the egg is hard, remove the shell and cut it in half, separating the yolks that you can crumble into the bowl; then cut the egg whites into pieces and add them, along with the other ingredients: the potato, peas, and carrots .
Now prepare the Fake mayonnaise without eggs : pour the soy milk and sunflower oil into a tall glass, the plastic glass of the immersion blender will work perfectly . Add the salt and 1 tablespoon of vinegar (or lemon juice) .
Immerse the immersion blender into the glass and blend the ingredients at medium speed until the mixture has thickened , it will take a few seconds. Then pour the mock mayonnaise into the bowl with the diced vegetables and egg and mix everything , if necessary, adjust with salt and pepper.
At this point, wash and dry the lettuce leaves well, remove the crunchy central rib with a small knife and cut them in half . After overlapping the two halves of the leaf , place a spoonful of the mixture in the center .
Fold the sides of the leaf inward and then roll up from the bottom to form a small package . Orient the side with the closure down and seal with a chive string . Your cold lettuce vegetable rolls are ready to be served and enjoyed immediately!
Store the cold lettuce meat rolls in the refrigerator in an airtight container or well covered with plastic wrap for a maximum of one day, since they are made with raw meat. Store the cold lettuce vegetable rolls in the refrigerator in an airtight container or well covered with plastic wrap for up to 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Stop at first glance? Never! Suppose you don't like raw meat: not tasting these rolls would be a crime. Much better to consider the possibility of replacing the filling with a classic favorite, such as ham, either raw or cooked, naturally accompanied by fresh cheese. Alternatively, for a seafood version, we suggest smoked salmon: lip-smacking good!
