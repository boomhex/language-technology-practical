instructions:
To prepare the Bolognese cutlet, start by taking the slices of meat and pounding them . If they are too large, cut them in half for convenience . Then season with salt and pepper .
Turn them over and season the other side in the same way . For the breading: break the eggs into a bowl and add salt and pepper , beat well .
Now coat the meat slices first in the flour , then in the egg .
Drain the excess egg well and finally pass them in the breadcrumbs . Proceed in this way until they are all breaded . At this point, use a pan large enough so as not to overlap the slices, otherwise you will have to cook them in more batches. Put the butter in the pan and let it melt over medium heat .
Place the cutlets inside and let them brown for about 3 minutes per side , then turn them over . Place the prosciutto on top .
Cover the prosciutto with the grated Parmesan and also pour in the broth . Cover with the lid and wait a couple of minutes.
Then add more grated Parmesan and cover again. Cook for another 2 minutes with the lid on until the cheese is melted . Then serve the cutlets adding some cooking juices on top .
We recommend consuming the cutlets immediately. Alternatively, they can be stored in the refrigerator for 1 day and reheated before serving.
Instead of butter, you can use clarified butter, which has a higher smoke point.
