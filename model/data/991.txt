instructions:
To prepare the sourdough bread with pumpkin seeds, combine the flour, water , and refreshed sourdough from 1 day ago in a bowl. Work with your hands for about 5 minutes until you obtain a soft and homogeneous dough .
Cover with a dish towel and let it rest for about 15 minutes. Then add the salt and pumpkin seeds .
Work the dough by bringing the outside towards the inside by rotating the bowl with fluid movements . Work for about 2/3 minutes until the dough detaches easily from the edges of the bowl .
Cover again with a dish towel and let it rest for about 10 minutes. Give the first of the 3 folds (total). Take an outer flap of the dough and bring it towards the center . Rotate the bowl and repeat the same operation. Do the same thing two more times. Cover with a dish towel and let it rest for about 15 minutes. Then perform the second fold, as just done for the first. Cover with the dish towel and let it rest for 15 minutes. Repeat the last of the 3 folds. Cover with the dish towel and let it rest for 15 minutes. Slightly round the dough inside the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for about 6 hours at room temperature.
At this point, the dough will have doubled. Transfer to the refrigerator and let it rest for 18 hours. Retrieve the dough, which will be as it was the previous evening . Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface . Gently stretch the dough forming a rectangle of about 12x8 inches .
Fold the upper part towards the center and the lower part over it . Take the smaller open side and bring it towards the inside .
Repeat the operation for the other side . Turn the bundle upside down and quickly round it with your hands . Line a bread mold (or a bowl) with a dish towel and flour it .
Transfer the rounded dough with the closure facing up . Lightly flour the surface and cover with a dish towel . Let it rest for 1 hour at room temperature, then transfer again to the refrigerator for 2 hours. At this point, preheat the oven to 482°F static, leaving the baking sheet for the bread in the oven until it reaches temperature. Then retrieve the dough from the fridge .
and without burning yourself, also remove the baking sheet from the oven. Lightly sprinkle the baking sheet with some flour and place the cold dough on it. Lightly dust the surface of the bread with flour and make a cut using a sharp blade . Bake in the oven for about 45 minutes at 482°F. Then remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before cutting and serving it.
The bread can be stored in a paper bag for 2-3 days. Alternatively, it can be frozen after it has cooled well or in slices.
Instead of pumpkin seeds, you can use a mix of seeds (flax, sunflower, and sesame).
Remember to wait until the bread has completely cooled before slicing it!
