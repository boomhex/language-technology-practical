instructions:
To prepare the roast pork with potatoes, first place the garlic, rosemary, and sage on a cutting board and chop them finely . Take the pork and tie it as if it were a roast ; you can follow our cooking guide How to tie a roast , or have your trusted butcher do it.
Transfer the roast to a baking tray with parchment paper and sprinkle the meat with the herb mix , then season with salt , pepper, and oil .
Massage the meat well , pour the white wine into the bottom of the tray , and cover it with a sheet of parchment paper .
Also cover the tray with a sheet of aluminum foil and bake for about an hour at 356°F in a preheated fan oven. Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut them into wedges .
In a bowl, season the potatoes with salt , rosemary , paprika , and ground black pepper.
Add olive oil and mix well. After an hour of cooking the meat, remove it from the oven and add the potatoes around it .
Continue cooking for another 30-40 minutes, without covering the tray, until the potatoes are golden and crispy . Once cooked, let the pork rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing it . Serve the roast pork with the potatoes hot!
You can store the roast pork with potatoes in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
If you have time, let the meat marinate for 30 minutes before cooking it. To make a quick sauce to accompany the meat, proceed as follows: in a bowl, mix extra virgin olive oil, a finely chopped clove of garlic, a teaspoon of fresh chopped rosemary, the juice of half a lemon, salt and pepper to taste, and a teaspoon of mustard if you like!
