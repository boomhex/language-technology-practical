A plate of risotto with beer from Northern Italy is like a delightful twist on classic comfort food. Seriously good stuff. This region is really known for its creamy rice dishes. But this one? It stands out with a mix of aromatic red beer, golden saffron, and that sharp, nutty taste of Grana Padano DOP cheese. And the saffron? It gives the rice a bright, golden color and a subtle tangy edge, while the beer adds a malty depth you don’t always find in your typical saffron risotto . Pretty much a masterpiece.
It’s the kind of food that feels fancy but keeps things pretty simple—just a handful of ingredients, each bringing its own unique flair. Really, the cheese helps make the risotto extra creamy and smooth, so every bite is rich without being heavy. You get a little bit of everything: a pop of color, a whiff of malty hops, and that risotto silkiness. Super tasty.
In regions like Lombardy, people put their own spin on Grana Padano risotto , but adding beer turns a traditional Italian rice dish into something unexpected. And here's the thing—this beer risotto recipe doesn’t shy away from its local roots. For real, it points out the flavors that make Northern Italian food so appealing. While some compare it to Milanese risotto because of the saffron, the beer sets it apart, giving it a moist, almost tender vibe that’s different from wine-based versions. You know, you end up with a dish that looks special on the table, thanks to that golden hue, but what captures you is the mix of sweet and savory.
People love serving it at gatherings or on a night when you want something way way out of the ordinary. It proves that you don’t need a long list of fancy ingredients to create a great beer risotto recipe —just quality items and a little patience. Each spoonful nods to Northern Italy’s tradition, with a twist that keeps things fun and interesting for anyone who enjoys gourmet risotto recipes . I gotta say, this dish is more than just a meal; it’s an experience that brings together the best of Italian culinary tradition with a touch of innovative flair.
To make the beer, saffron, and Grana Padano risotto, first prepare the Vegetable broth and keep it warm. Then clean the shallot and finely chop it with a knife . Heat the olive oil in a pan, add the shallot and let it soften over moderate heat until it becomes tender. Pour in the rice and toast it for a couple of minutes.
Deglaze with the beer and let it evaporate. Stir and pour a little broth at a time , waiting for the liquid to be absorbed before adding more. Toward the end of cooking, dissolve the saffron powder in a small bowl with a bit of hot water .
Stir to dissolve it . Pour this mixture into the rice then salt and pepper to taste. Once cooked, turn off the heat, and season with thyme leaves .
Stir in the grated Grana Padano PDO and let it rest for a moment. The beer, saffron, and Grana Padano risotto is ready , enjoy it hot .
We recommend serving the beer, saffron, and Grana Padano risotto immediately.
The beer will give a special aromatic note to this first dish; if you don't like the intense taste of red beer, you can opt for a light beer.
