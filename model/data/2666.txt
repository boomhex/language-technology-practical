instructions:
To prepare the plum cake, start by pouring the batter ingredients, all at room temperature: the butter in pieces, the eggs , the sugar , and the milk .
In a small bowl, sift the all-purpose flour, add the almond flour and the baking powder. Then pour the dry ingredients into the mixer , turn on the blades to mix the ingredients and obtain a homogeneous and creamy batter. Grate the zest of an untreated lemon to flavor the mixture.
Once ready, pour it into a 28 cm (11-inch) diameter cake pan previously greased and lined with parchment paper and level the surface with a spatula . Prepare the plums: rinse them under running water , then dry them thoroughly, remove the pit, and cut them into wedges .
Distribute the slices horizontally over the entire surface of the cake, in a radial pattern, starting from the edge and reaching the center . Then sprinkle the surface with sliced almonds and bake the cake in a static oven preheated to 356°F for 60 minutes (320°F for about 50 minutes if using a convection oven). Once cooked, take the plum cake out of the oven and then remove it from the pan to cool down before serving.
Store the plum cake under a glass dome for 3-4 days. You can freeze it if you have used fresh, not previously frozen, ingredients.
Once cooled, dust the plum cake with powdered sugar. You can use the same batter to make an apple, peach, or apricot cake!
