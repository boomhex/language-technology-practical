instructions:
To prepare the parmesan and parsley lamb chops, start by removing the fat around the meat first by cutting it with a knife and then pulling it with your fingers to separate it from the meat . Then clean the protruding bone well with a small knife by scraping the entire surface to remove the cartilage that surrounds it .
Gently pound the chops with a meat tenderizer after covering them with parchment paper to avoid damaging the meat . In a bowl, beat the eggs, adding the grated parmesan , a pinch of salt, finely chopped parsley , and a crushed garlic clove.
In a large pan, heat 6 tablespoons of oil and the butter; then coat the chops first in flour and then in the egg mixture so that they are completely and perfectly covered , drain them well and brown them over high heat on both sides , so they become nicely golden without overcooking (2-3 minutes per side). Let the parmesan and parsley lamb chops dry for a moment on some paper towels, then place them on a serving plate accompanied by some lemon wedges, and garnish with curly parsley.
Lamb chops are obtained from the rack cut into slices; when purchasing, it is better to have the chops cut thick enough so that cooking does not make them tough; also remember to remove all the fat from the lamb meat before cooking.
Lamb meat is highly digestible, low in calories, and high in nutritional value; an ovine is considered a lamb if it is over two months of age and up to one year, as after that it is called a sheep (if female) or a ram (if male). The ideal lamb for cooking should be 5-6 months old and weigh between 11 and 17 lbs.
