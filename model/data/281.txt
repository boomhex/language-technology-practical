instructions:
To prepare the spaghetti with turnip greens cream, nduja, and stracciatella, first separate the tops and leaves of the turnip greens from the stem . Blanch them in lightly salted boiling water for a few seconds , then drain and immerse them in ice water to stop the cooking and preserve the color. Keep the cooking water aside, as it will be needed later to cook the pasta.
Drain and squeeze the turnip greens well , then transfer them to a jug. Add a little water and season with salt and pepper .
Add the oil and blend with an immersion blender until you get a smooth and homogeneous cream .
Cook the spaghetti in the turnip greens' cooking water . Meanwhile, in a non-stick pan, put 0.35 oz of nduja with a drizzle of oil and let it melt over very low heat. In the meantime, put the stracciatella and 1 oz of nduja in a jug .
Blend until you get a homogeneous cream , then transfer it to a piping bag .
Add a ladle of pasta cooking water to the pan , then drain the spaghetti al dente . Add the turnip greens cream and another ladle of cooking water, then quickly toss everything to mix the dressing.
Turn off the heat and mix with a drizzle of oil . Plate by adding a few dollops of stracciatella nduja cream . Your spaghetti with turnip greens cream, nduja, and stracciatella is ready to be enjoyed !
It's recommended to consume the spaghetti with turnip greens cream, nduja, and stracciatella immediately; if you have leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for up to one day.
Taste the nduja before using it, to adjust the amount according to the level of spiciness!
For a meat-free version, you can replace the nduja with a roasted red pepper cream blended with a pinch of chili to maintain a spicy note.
Instead of stracciatella, you can use burrata or fresh ricotta, which will provide a similar texture but a milder flavor.
