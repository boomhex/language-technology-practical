To prepare the phyllo pastry baskets with ice cream, start by placing a sheet of phyllo pastry in front of you at a time : fold one-third of the rectangle inward , then overlap the other third to obtain a smaller rectangle .
Fold this rectangle in half, thus obtaining a square. Trim the edges of the square with a smooth-bladed knife , separate the 6 sheets it consists of , and slightly rotate them so that the tips are staggered, forming a kind of star with multiple points . Repeat the same process with the other 3 sheets of phyllo pastry.
Pour the vegetable oil into a saucepan and heat it to 340°F. Place one star at a time into the boiling oil, position a small aluminum mold about 2 inches in diameter at the base , and press it with a spoon to ensure the phyllo pastry stays submerged in the oil while taking the shape of the mold . After a couple of minutes, flip the basket with the help of another spoon and fry for another 2 minutes to color the inside .
When the basket is evenly golden, remove it from the oil and let it drain upside down on a tray lined with paper towels . Proceed in the same way to fry all the baskets. Once cooled, place the baskets on a serving plate, fill them each with a scoop of vanilla ice cream , and garnish with the strawberry topping : your phyllo pastry baskets with ice cream are ready to be enjoyed!
The phyllo pastry baskets, if not filled, can be stored for up to 3 days in a place protected from humidity.
You can sprinkle the inside of the still-warm baskets with a mix of unsweetened cocoa and sugar, or add some chopped hazelnuts, fresh fruit, or whipped cream...
