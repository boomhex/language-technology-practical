instructions:
Clean and cut the broccoli and cauliflower into small florets so they can be eaten in one bite, keeping the cauliflower stalk. Boil the broccoli and cauliflower pieces in salted boiling water in separate pots (they have different cooking times) until tender but still crunchy. Meanwhile, soak a tablespoon of raisins in lemon juice .
Place the freshly drained broccoli in an ice bath to cool them immediately, maintaining their crunchy texture and bright green color. Once cool, drain them. Retrieve the cauliflower stalk, cut it into two pieces, and boil them together with the parsley stems that you have washed and cut into pieces. When the stems are tender, drain them and blend in a mixer, adding some of their cooking water until you obtain a thick and velvety cream. In the blender glass (or mixer), pour the oil, lemon juice, cauliflower cream, parsley stems, mustard, and a dash of nutmeg, then blend . Finally, adjust with salt and pepper.
Toast the pine nuts in a pan until they take on a nice copper color. Cut the Belgian endive into thin strips, place them at the bottom of the plate, and dress with a bit of dressing . Add the cauliflower and broccoli and distribute a tablespoon of dressing over the vegetables. Finally, sprinkle the pine nuts and raisins and finish with a dash of nutmeg and black pepper.
