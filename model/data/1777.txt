Yogurt and granola piadina hails from the Emilia-Romagna region, where folks have been whipping up soft, tender flatbreads for ages. This spin on the classic sweet piadina recipe mixes Italian tradition with a bit of international flair. Honestly, the piadina is a moist base, still warm and slightly chewy, layered with Greek yogurt that’s cool and creamy. And you know what? A pile of fresh berries—like strawberries and blueberries—tops it off, adding a tangy pop against the smooth yogurt. And what really really makes this dish stand out is the homemade granola . It's sweetened with a drizzle of acacia honey—super tasty. Plus, it’s loaded with toasted nuts and oats, giving you a crispy crunch in every bite. A mix of textures and flavors that's light and fresh? For sure.
Many call it a modern breakfast piadina , but it works just as well as a healthy snack or even a light dessert. Unlike the usual piadina with cheese or meats, this version skips the heavy stuff, bringing you something sweet but not over the top. Really, the combo of fruit, honey, and Italian flatbread with yogurt offers a dish that feels wholesome yet has that treat vibe. You'll taste the flavors of Emilia-Romagna in every mouthful. The piadina itself has a mild taste that lets the golden granola and juicy fruit shine through. And plenty of families in Northern Italy have started making this type of yogurt and granola piadina for breakfast or after-school snacks. It’s quick, and gives you that feel-good, fresh food energy. A fun way to see how old-school Italian recipes keep getting new spins. Which is great.
Here's the deal: for anyone who likes their food light and satisfying, this is one of those treats that really does the job. Super, super good.
To make the yogurt and granola flatbread, first, prepare the granola. Rinse the raisins and goji berries. Then coarsely chop the hazelnuts, almonds, and walnuts . Proceed with the syrup: in a pan, pour the honey, water, oil, , and sugar .
Cook for 10 minutes over medium heat until you create a syrup , then turn off the heat and add the oats , the previously chopped nuts .
Add the well-drained and dried raisins and the goji berries, also well dried . Mix with a spatula to combine .
Pour the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spread it evenly with the spatula (10-11), then bake in a preheated static oven at 320°F for 30 minutes on the middle rack. Once cooked, remove your granola, which will be golden brown, and let it cool for at least 30 minutes .
In the meantime, prepare the cream: in a small bowl, pour the yogurt and honey and mix . Whip the fresh liquid cream with electric beaters .
until it is well stiff , at this point incorporate it into the yogurt . Wash raspberries and strawberries and remove the stems and leaves from the latter .
Now heat each flatbread in a pan for about 1 minute on each side. Transfer it to a cutting board and fill half of the flatbread with the yogurt cream , granola, and red berries .
Fold the flatbread, cut it in half , garnish with powdered sugar , and serve your yogurt and granola flatbread .
It is recommended to consume the yogurt and granola flatbread immediately. It is preferable to prepare the granola the day before to have all the ingredients ready for use, storing it in an airtight jar. The granola keeps for up to 1 week.
You can replace the red berries with soft seasonal fruits like peaches, apricots, figs, grapes.
