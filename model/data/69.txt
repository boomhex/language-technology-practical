instructions:
To prepare the autumn vegetarian burger, first boil the potatoes starting from cold water for about 30 minutes from boiling, or until they are soft enough to be easily pierced with a fork . Meanwhile, chop the garlic , then clean the mushrooms: remove the base and gently rub them with a damp paper towel .
Thinly slice the champignons and move to the stove. Heat a drizzle of oil with the garlic in a pan, then add the mushrooms and a pinch of salt. Flavor with chopped parsley and sauté the mushrooms for about 5 minutes. Once cooked, chop the mushrooms with a knife.
At this point, the potatoes will be cooked: peel them and mash them in a bowl . Add the chopped mushrooms .
Also add the grated cheese , eggs , and some chopped parsley .
Finally, pour in the breadcrumbs and adjust with salt and pepper . Mix well to combine everything and divide the mixture into 4 portions . Flatten them between the palms of your hands to form the burgers.
Transfer the burgers to a baking tray lined with parchment paper lightly greased with oil , then also season the surface and bake in a preheated static oven at 400°F for about 20 minutes . Your autumn vegetarian burgers are ready to be enjoyed !
The autumn vegetarian burger keeps in the refrigerator for 2 days when cooked and for one day when raw.
To further enhance the flavor of your autumn vegetarian burger, you can enrich the champignons during cooking with dried porcini mushrooms. Alternatively, you can add some leek to the sauté.
