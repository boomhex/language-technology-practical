instructions:
To prepare the vegetarian cabbage rolls, take the cabbage and remove the 10 largest and tender leaves . Boil the leaves in plenty of salted water for 3 minutes , drain them and let them cool by placing them on an overturned bowl on the table .
Clean and chop the onion . Peel and julienne the carrots . In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil with the garlic .
Add the carrots , salt, a splash of water and cook for 8 minutes. Meanwhile, blend half of the pre-cooked chickpeas together with tahini, salt, and pepper .
You should obtain a cream . Remove the garlic from the vegetables , then add both the blended chickpeas and the whole chickpeas .
Add the olives as well and let the mixture dry well, which should be soft but quite compact . Stuff the cabbage leaves with the chickpea filling .
Close the rolls by folding the sides and then rolling them up . Oil a baking dish large enough to hold all the pieces .
Season with salt, pepper, and oil . Bake in the preheated ventilated oven at 356°F for 20 minutes. Plate and finish the dish with a drizzle of oil: the vegetarian cabbage rolls are ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the vegetarian cabbage rolls immediately and while hot. If you have leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator in an airtight container for a couple of days.
Freezing is not recommended.
Tahini is a typical Middle Eastern sauce easily found in major supermarkets; if you want to make it at home, you can follow the recipe found in the Hummus recipe.
