To prepare the dough for the little hearts, pour the milk into a saucepan, add the butter and salt and bring to just below boiling; remove the saucepan from the heat and immediately add the flour, all at once . With the help of a spoon, stir vigorously until the ingredients are combined and obtain a rather compact mixture (if it looks lumpy don't worry).
Let the obtained dough cool slightly , then transfer it to a lightly floured surface and knead with your hands until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough .
Let the little hearts' dough cool completely and in the meantime prepare the filling by mixing the goat cheese, salt, pepper, and chives in a bowl . Roll out the dough with a rolling pin forming a rectangular sheet about 1/16 inch to 1/12 inch thick at most: with a teaspoon, take some of the filling and place it in small mounds on the sheet about 4 inches apart from each other.
Cover the mounds with dough (folding it like a book) and with the heart-shaped cutter cut out the shapes (11-12). Proceed this way, kneading the scraps each time until the ingredients are used up. Once all the shapes are obtained, take two plates: in one you will put the breadcrumbs and in the other the beaten egg.
Dip each little heart first in the beaten egg , then pass it in the breadcrumbs and fry it in moderately hot oil (not boiling) until golden on both sides . Drain the little hearts, place them on kitchen paper towels, and serve immediately.
These little hearts are also ideal for children, for whom you can vary both the shape (using figures of flowers or animals) and the filling, using, for example, cooked ham and mozzarella, or mozzarella and tomato, etc...
