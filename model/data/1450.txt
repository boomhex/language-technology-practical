To make the chocolate poke cake, first focus on the dough: in a bowl, pour the softened butter cut into cubes and the sugar . Beat the mixture with electric beaters , then add the whole room temperature eggs .
Continue to beat the mixture until it is light and homogeneous, at this point also add the dark chocolate melted in a bain-marie or microwave , ensuring it has cooled. Turn on the beaters again and mix until you get a homogeneous mixture . Now incorporate the flour previously sifted through a sieve .
The room temperature milk and the sifted baking powder . Butter a 8x8 inch square rimless mold and place it on a baking tray lined with parchment paper .
Pour the mixture into the mold . Level the surface with a spatula and bake the base in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 30 minutes on the middle shelf. Once cooked, remove the cake and let it cool before removing it from the mold .
Meanwhile, prepare the ganache: chop the dark chocolate , heat the cream in a saucepan, then pour it hot over the chocolate , stirring with a whisk until the chocolate is completely melted .
Now remove the mold from the base, use the handle of a wooden spoon to make equidistant holes about 1 inch apart . You should get 20 holes in total . Now transfer the ganache to a piping bag without a tip and fill the inside of the holes .
Use a spatula to level the surface to remove excess cream. Flavor the fresh cream with the seeds of half a vanilla pod and whip it with the beaters until it is fluffy and firm .
At this point, cover the cake with the cream, spreading it with the spatula to create a wavy pattern. Garnish with dark chocolate flakes , serve your poke cake cut into cubes .
Store the chocolate poke cake in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. You can freeze the base without filling and covering.
