To make the salmon club sandwich, start by preparing the hard-boiled eggs: place the whole eggs in a saucepan, cover with water, and cook for 8 minutes from the moment the water starts boiling . Meanwhile, prepare the other ingredients: cut the avocado in half, remove the pit, and scoop out the flesh from the skin with a spoon , then slice it not too thinly .
Wash and slice the cherry tomatoes . Peel the eggs that will have cooled slightly and slice them . Now melt the butter in another saucepan and remove the crust from the white bread slices .
Brush the slices of bread with the melted butter , then toast them briefly on a grill on both sides . You are ready to assemble the first club sandwich: first, spread one slice of bread with mayonnaise .
Add some arugula leaves , place the tomato slices , and season with a pinch of salt. Continue with the smoked salmon .
Add a few drops of lemon juice , then place the avocado slices and season with a dash of pepper .

Arugula , tomatoes and salt, then smoked salmon and lemon juice.
Finally, avocado , pepper, and hard-boiled eggs . Spread another slice of bread with mayonnaise .
Cover the sandwich always facing the mayonnaise side of the bread down . Insert two toothpicks into opposite corners to stabilize the layers and cut the club sandwich in half . Proceed in the same way to make the second one. Your salmon club sandwich is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the salmon club sandwich immediately, while the bread is still warm. If necessary, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to one day.
You can customize the salmon club sandwich with your favorite ingredients, for example by using wholemeal bread instead of white bread, or replacing mayonnaise with cream cheese or a faux mayonnaise!
It is preferable to remove the crust from the white bread slices; alternatively, you can use sandwich bread.
