To make the tajarin 30 yolks with sausage ragout, first prepare the fresh pasta: place the flour in a well on a work surface and pour the yolks in the center , then add a drizzle of oil .
Start breaking the yolks with a fork to incorporate them into the flour . As soon as the mixture starts to come together, use a dough scraper to gather all the ingredients , then continue to knead with your hands for about 10 minutes .
You should obtain a dough with a very firm and elastic consistency; if necessary, you can wet your hands and continue kneading to hydrate it slightly . Once ready, form a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap . Let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, or for the time needed to prepare the ragout.
Peel and finely chop the onion, carrot, and celery. Heat a drizzle of oil in a pot, then break the sausage into small pieces inside, having previously removed the casing . Brown the meat over high heat, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, but be careful not to let it dry out too much or burn the cooking base . When the sausage is golden, add the chopped onion .
Add the carrot , celery , and a whole clove of garlic , then let them soften over a gentle heat.
After a few minutes, add the tomato paste and mix well to toast it, always scraping the bottom of the pot . At this point, remove the garlic and deglaze with the red wine , continuing to scrape the bottom with the spoon to deglaze it.
Add the bunch of aromatic herbs that you have tied together with string , then pour in the tomato puree and a splash of water, just enough to rinse the bottle. Cover with a lid and cook for at least 30 minutes .
After the resting time, take the dough and work one portion at a time, being careful to wrap the rest in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out. Lightly dust the portion of dough with semolina , flatten it with the palm of your hand, and start passing it through the pasta machine, starting from the widest setting . Occasionally make some folds .
Continue rolling out the dough by gradually reducing the thickness . When you have obtained a thin and silky sheet, divide it in half and lightly dust with semolina , then trim the edges and roll it up on itself .
Cut the rolled-up sheet to obtain tajarin with a maximum width of 1/8 inch , then unroll them and dust them again with a pinch of semolina. Form nests and place them on a tray , continuing in this way until the dough is used up.
After you have made all the tajarin, transfer the sausage ragout to a pan, pepper it and heat it over low heat. Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the tajarin, being careful not to add too many at once . As soon as they rise to the surface, drain them and add them to the sauce in the pan .
Increase the heat and briefly mix to combine them, adding a ladle of the cooking water to prevent them from drying out . Turn off the heat and mix in the cold butter , then sprinkle off the heat with the grated Parmigiano Reggiano PDO . Mix well and serve.
Complete the dishes with more ragout , pepper, and Parmesan . Your tajarin 30 yolks with sausage ragout are ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the tajarin 30 yolks with sausage ragout immediately.
The sausage ragout can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container or it can be frozen.
The consistency of the fresh pasta 30 yolks is quite hard but may vary slightly depending on the size of the eggs; if you deem it necessary, you can wet your hands with a little water. Since this is a dough with very low hydration, it is normal for it to tend to tear and dry out quickly.
To cut the tajarin, you can also proceed in another way, folding the sheet first in the center and then onto itself to form fewer folds (you can find more details in the video).
It is not necessary to salt the ragout because the sausage makes it salty enough.
We recommend choosing a high-quality red wine, preferably from the region, such as a Barbera or Nebbiolo.
