To prepare the porcini terrine, start by preparing the potatoes. Wash and peel them, then cut them into slices and then into strips , then into cubes ; set them aside. Finely chop the rosemary .
Sauté a clove of garlic in a non-stick pan with oil . When it is golden, remove it , add the chopped rosemary and mix it with the oil.
Add the potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Heat over moderate heat and continue to stir the potatoes to achieve even cooking , until you observe a light golden crust on the surface: it will take about 5 minutes. Set aside.
Now move on to preparing the How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms : with a small knife, remove the earthy part by scraping it off . If the mushrooms have little soil, you can simply remove it using a brush . Cut the porcini into slices lengthwise .
Take another non-stick pan, heat a drizzle of oil with the chopped rosemary and add the porcini . Season with salt and pepper. Cook over moderate heat for about 7-8 minutes, then deglaze with white wine .
Stir the mushrooms until they are cooked, with a light crust on the surface and an amber color: it will take another 3 minutes. Pour them into a bowl and let them cool for about 10 minutes. Also add the potatoes to the bowl .
Add the washed and dried thyme leaves . In a separate small bowl, beat the eggs with a fork and season with salt .
Pour the beaten eggs into the bowl with potatoes and mushrooms and use an immersion blender to blend the ingredients until you obtain a homogeneous mixture. Mix the ingredients well .
Butter a mold 2.75 inches high, 3.94 inches wide, 10.63 inches long and line it with parchment paper , making sure the parchment paper adheres well to the edges .
Pour the mixture in and level it . Now the porcini terrine is ready to be baked in a preheated fan oven at 392°F for 50 minutes . While the porcini terrine is baking, prepare the cheese fondue. In a saucepan, heat the milk and then melt the butter in another double-bottomed saucepan .
When it is completely melted, sprinkle in the flour while stirring well with a hand whisk to avoid lumps. Continue to stir until the roux is well golden. Add the lukewarm milk and continue to stir until the béchamel thickens. Then turn off the heat and add the grated Asiago cheese , melting it into the béchamel with the hand whisk.
You will need to whisk the mixture until it is homogeneous and the cheese is completely melted. Then transfer it to a kitchen squeeze bottle and set it aside. After the baking time, remove the terrine from the oven (you may perform the toothpick test) . Turn it over onto a serving plate , being careful to remove the parchment paper.
Cut some slices and with the squeeze bottle containing the fondue, decorate the slices of the porcini terrine and serve them warm !
It is preferable to consume the porcini terrine immediately. If there are leftovers, keep them in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container.
If you have used only fresh and not thawed ingredients, the porcini terrine can be frozen after cooking.
