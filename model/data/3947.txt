Bite-sized and golden brown, crab puff appetizers bring that special something to the table with their awesome texture and flavor—crispy outside, creamy and rich inside. That nice combo of crab and cheese puffs plus the classic blend you get from cream cheese crab appetizers makes them a real hit for family gatherings, especially when everyone just wants a snack that feels a little extra special. Weekend parties and family celebrations feel more festive with a big platter of these on the coffee table since the cute soft pillows look just like everybody’s favorite takeout treat. You usually get comments about how they taste just like those Chinese takeout recipes everyone talks about...without leaving the house. The mild seafood flavor and mellow cheese inside give a great balance, making these work for both picky kids and grownups who want a snack with a bit more flavor. Plus, that pretty shape and nice color look SO good lined up with veggies or dips—you’ll hear about it all meal long.
Families dealing with busy days appreciate how crab puff appetizers offer something special that feels like a reward at the end of the week. Versatile enough for birthday parties, neighborhood gatherings, or even a simple weekend lunch, these cream cheese crab appetizers really fit any occasion. Add a little dipping bowl—soy sauce or sweet chili—and it turns snack time into something interactive, especially good for kids who like eating with their hands (and let’s face it, adults love it too). Since easy crab recipes with a crispy texture feel fun and spontaneous, they often go right to the top of the snack wish list. Try them side by side with veggie sticks or toss them next to some simple rice for a change—either way you get that nice balance of crunchy and creamy every time. If families want a party food that stands out but still feels comfortable and familiar, these crab and cheese puffs absolutely do the trick, with a friendly vibe that brings everybody around again for seconds (and sometimes thirds).
First, preheat the oven to 400°F and butter two baking sheets. Prepare the puffs with the amounts indicated in this recipe and the process that you can find Choux pastry (pâte à choux) . After placing your mounds of choux pastry on the trays , bake the puffs in a preheated static oven for 15 minutes at 430°F, avoiding opening the oven during cooking. After the first 15 minutes lower the temperature to 375°F and bake the choux pastry for another 10 minutes. If you want to bake your puffs in a fan-assisted oven, preheat it to 350°F and bake the puffs for 30 minutes. At this point, turn off the oven and leave the puffs inside for another 30 minutes with the door slightly open (place a wooden spoon between the door and the oven); this will help dry the inside, then take them out of the oven and set them aside to cool .
Meanwhile, prepare the bechamel sauce with the amounts indicated in this recipe and the process you can find Béchamel sauce . Cut the cheese into slices about 1/4 inch thick and grate it . In a saucepan, heat the butter with the oil and sauté the crab meat for a couple of minutes, season with salt and paprika, and transfer the crab meat to a bowl, add half of the bechamel and mix well .
Pour the grated Gruyere into a bowl with the remaining bechamel and mix well , season with salt if necessary. Cut the 20 puffs in half with a sharp thin-bladed knife .
and slightly hollow them out inside ; fill them with the two fillings . Set aside a small amount of each of the two fillings which you will use to garnish the top of the puffs along with thyme and chives . If you don't consume them immediately, put them in the refrigerator in a container with a lid and take them out 15 minutes before serving.
This delicious appetizer can also be used for Valentine's Day for a candlelit dinner. The crab meat, being aphrodisiac, will be an excellent wake-up call for all your senses.
Since this appetizer requires a long preparation, if you intend to serve it for a special occasion it will be convenient to cook fillings and puffs the day before, to speed up the operations before dinner. If you make the choux pastry at home, you can get creative with shapes beyond the classic puffs: I usually make rings or eclairs (small sticks).
