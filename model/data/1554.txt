instructions:
To prepare the candies with pistachios, bresaola, and robiola, first prepare the brisè dough. In a bowl, or in the bowl of a stand mixer, place the flour. Add the cubed butter and gradually add the water . Both the butter and the water must be very cold. Quickly work the brisè dough until you obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Form a dough ball and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. After the resting time, take the dough ball, sprinkle the work surface with a little flour, and roll out the brisè dough with a rolling pin to obtain a thin sheet .
Use a pastry wheel to trim the edges of the sheet giving it an almost rectangular shape. Cut it into rectangles measuring 4x5 inches. With these doses, you will get 12 candies . Now take each rectangle
and place a slice of bresaola on top . Spread the robiola and add the shelled pistachios .
Fold the top and bottom edges towards the center. Twist the ends (15-16)
to form the candies . Brush the surface with a beaten egg .
Place the candies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, sprinkle them with pistachio crumbs and bake in a static oven at 356°F for about 20 minutes until golden brown . Once cooked, remove your candies from the oven and let them cool slightly before enjoying them .
The brisè candies with pistachios and bresaola can be stored for 2-3 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They can be frozen uncooked.
Have fun experimenting with new combinations by filling the candies with your preferred ingredients: cooked ham, stracchino, and hazelnut crumbs is one of the possible variations!
