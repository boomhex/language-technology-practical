Whether you use bunny, bear, or even little hedgehog molds, the animal shapes make these cookies look great on the buffet. Kids get excited to grab one. Seriously good. They show up a lot at birthday parties in Northern Italy, where Parmigiano is king, but you’ll find them all over the country now. For real, they’re a go-to snack salati fatti in casa for big family gatherings.

Unlike the usual sandwiches or chips, these bring something playful and a bit special to the party—kids love the shapes, and adults like the tender cheese flavor that hits just the right spot. Some folks even add a pinch of black pepper or a sprinkle of rosemary to change things up, but Parmigiano is always the main flavor. To be honest, they’re pretty quick to make, and you don’t need fancy skills to get that golden, crispy finish. Whether you’re passing them out as antipasti sfiziosi or piling them up as biscotti salati per bambini , these cheesy little animals bring something different to any snack table. And listen, they’re the sort of treat people keep coming back for. For sure. Grabbing another whenever they walk by. You can call them biscotti salati al parmigiano or just party cookies, but either way, they’re a sure way to put smiles on faces, especially when you want to mix some tangy flavor with a little bit of fun. These really really good snacks make any gathering feel more special and lively.
Start the preparation of the savory animal-shaped cookies by placing the flour on a work surface, then use a spoon to create a well in the center and pour in the finely grated parmesan , add the butter in pieces, and the salt
then knead with your fingers quickly until you get a smooth dough . Form a dough ball, wrap it with plastic wrap , and let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. After the resting time, take the dough ball and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface creating a sheet about 1/8 inch thick
then, with the help of animal-shaped cookie cutters (such as butterflies, teddy bears, and bunnies), cut out the small cookies (7-8) and place them on a tray , put the cookies in the fridge for at least 15 minutes, this way they will retain their shape during baking.
Then transfer the cookies to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and decorate the shapes with poppy seeds: brush the surface with milk and apply the poppy seeds with a toothpick to define the animal features: eyes, mouth, ears, or even just the edge of the shape . Bake the cookies in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 10 minutes (if using a fan oven, at 320°F for 5-6 minutes), then, once cooked, take the cookies out of the oven and let them cool on a rack before enjoying them !
Store the savory animal-shaped cookies in a tin box for 2-3 days. You can freeze the dough and thaw it in the fridge when needed.
We are in the world of fairy tales, imagination is key! This recipe lends itself to many variations, according to your taste and the creativity of the moment: instead of black sesame, you can use lighter sesame, chopped pistachios, or poppy seeds; you can combine parmesan with pecorino, or replace it with another aged cheese; if you want, you can even color the dough. Want it red? You'll need a teaspoon of tomato paste. Prefer it yellow? Go for saffron!
