Looking for a refreshing treat on a hot day? You gotta try this mango chocolate frappé . Seriously, it’s just what you need. It’s a perfect balance of sweet and creamy with a slight tang from the mango—really really good. Unlike your typical smoothie that’s all about fresh fruit and milk, this frappé uses yogurt or even just a splash of water. And you know what? It stays light yet indulgent. Some folks even go the extra mile and add a scoop of ice cream, turning this mango chocolate blended drink into an over-the-top delight.
And listen, topping it with ganache and some chopped hazelnuts gives it a fun crunch, making it part dessert, part snack, and all-around fun. The combination of mango and chocolate might sound unusual, but once you take that first sip, the tender fruit and rich chocolate come together beautifully—especially when served ice-cold.
This mango chocolate frappé is perfect for those afternoon breaks when everyone needs a little pick-me-up. And look, unlike drinks that are either all fruity or just a classic chocolate shake, this mango chocolate smoothie strikes a balance. Golden, moist mango pieces mingling with smooth chocolate create a treat you’d love to share with friends or family. Pretty much everyone loves it. And the extras? Ganache and nuts, for sure.
The recipe is flexible—swap ingredients, experiment with flavors, and you’ll still enjoy that satisfying mix of crisp, cold, and rich goodness. Whether you call it a chocolate mango milkshake or a tropical escape—either way, it’s the kind of homemade treat that gets everyone talking and reaching for more. And really, you can’t go wrong with this one.
To prepare the mango and chocolate milkshake, first, peel the mango using a smooth-edged knife , then roughly chop the flesh, extracting as much as possible around the central pit . Transfer the mango flesh into a bowl, add the milk
and blend with an immersion blender , then add the sugar and blend again to mix everything together .
Now heat the cream in a small saucepan and bring it to just below boiling . In the meantime, chop the dark chocolate and transfer it into another bowl. When the cream is almost at boiling point, pour it into the bowl with the chopped chocolate
and mix well with a spatula or whisk until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture . Now you're ready to assemble your milkshake: take the glass jars and brush the inside with ganache using a brush , then place them in the freezer for a couple of minutes so that the chocolate sets .
Then take the jars from the freezer, fill them halfway with the mango smoothie, add a scoop of yogurt ice cream , pour in a bit more mango smoothie, place a second scoop of ice cream on top, and finally garnish with hazelnut crumbs and drizzle the remaining chocolate ganache: your mango and chocolate milkshake is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to serve the mango and chocolate milkshake immediately; if preferred, store the mango cream in the refrigerator for a couple of days in an airtight container and complete it only when serving.
There is no limit to indulgence! If you have a sweet tooth, you can top off the milkshake with a dollop of whipped cream and some dark chocolate shavings…
