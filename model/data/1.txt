When it comes to Christmas crespelle , Northern Italy really knows how to nail this festive dish. It’s the holiday season staple. Families gather around to enjoy these tender and moist crepes. What's inside? Rich tomato sauce, melting mozzarella, and savory cooked ham. And the salted ricotta—man, it's good—sprinkled both inside and out, gives each bite a creamy kick. Plus, there's no béchamel here—which is great. Makes it feel lighter but still super comforting, you know? Perfect for a chilly winter evening.
And here's the thing—pretty simple to make. Prep it ahead of time, and you're stress-free for big holiday meals. Families put their own spin on holiday crespelle recipes , adding local cheeses or swapping ham for prosciutto, depending on regional vibes. Across Northern Italy, from Tuscany to the Alps, you might spot crespelle alla Fiorentina or ricotta and spinach crepes, but the Christmas version is something else.
Its gooey, golden top? Seriously good. Festive flavors bring warmth to the table, turning everyday dinners into memorable feasts. And the scent from the oven—so, so inviting. With those crispy edges, these crepes are impossible to resist. Everyone gathers, shares stories, and laughs. The flavors remind us why these dishes are such treasures during the holidays. Whether in a rustic Tuscan kitchen or near the snow-capped Alps, Christmas crespelle adds magic to any meal, connecting everyone with shared memories and a little extra holiday spirit.
Honestly, holiday food doesn’t get much better than this. A plate full of soft, cheesy crepes, bubbling and ready to share with friends and family, really makes every moment together something special. It’s a treat, for sure.

To prepare the Christmas crepes, start with the crepe batter: in a bowl, beat the eggs , add the milk and mix again with a whisk .
Then pour in 2 tablespoons of melted butter, cooled (the remaining 2 teaspoons will be used for cooking) , mix and also add the sifted flour . Blend with the whisk until you get a smooth and homogeneous batter .
Cover the batter with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 10 minutes . Heat a crepe maker, add a piece of butter and let it melt, then spread it well over the entire surface with a brush or a paper towel. Pour a ladle of batter in the center of the pan and distribute the batter evenly. Cook for one minute on each side over medium heat .
As they are cooked, stack the crepes on a tray and cover them with plastic wrap or a cloth . Meanwhile, also prepare the sauce: peel and chop the onion. In a pot, add a drizzle of oil, a clove of garlic , and the chopped onion .
Let it stew over low heat for about 10 minutes, then add the tomato sauce , salt , and continue cooking over medium-low heat for about 30 minutes. At the end of cooking , adjust the salt, add the basil leaves, and remove the garlic.
Cut the pizza mozzarella into small cubes . You are ready to fill the crepes: top half of the first crepe with the sauce, then add a slice of ham and some mozzarella cubes .
Fold the crepe in half and then in half again, creating a triangle. Now spread a couple of tablespoons of sauce on the bottom of a baking dish and place the folded crepes inside as you fill them .
Cover with the remaining sauce and bake in a preheated static oven at 400°F for about 15 minutes. After the cooking time, take them out of the oven and serve. Top with grated salted ricotta, and your Christmas crepes are ready to be served !
The Christmas crepes can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
They can be frozen, either before or after cooking.
