instructions:
To prepare the fried tub gurnard, start with cleaning the fish fillets. Cut away the dorsal part where the central bone is, then the belly part with bones and cartilage . Detach the bones with the appropriate tweezers . Flip the fillets and make an incision with a smooth blade knife to facilitate peeling ,
then peel the skin away and cut the flesh into chunks about 1.5 inches . When finished, move on to the batter: pour the whole wheat flour and salt into a bowl .
Add the beer and mix with a whisk to avoid lumps : you should obtain a thick but fluid batter. Heat the oil to 302°F and dip a few pieces at a time first in the batter ,
then in the hot oil . Let cook for about 4 minutes and then drain on paper towels . After frying all the tub gurnard pieces, move on to the green chilies, which should be fried for a few minutes .
Drain the friggitelli and fry the cherry tomatoes for about 1 minute as well . Now that everything is ready, arrange your plate with the fried tub gurnard, friggitelli, and cherry tomatoes, salt to taste and eat immediately !
Storage is not recommended to preserve the crispness of the dish.
Vary the accompanying vegetables for the fried tub gurnard according to your tastes and seasonality. For a more special touch, add a pinch of chili pepper or smoked paprika to the batter!
