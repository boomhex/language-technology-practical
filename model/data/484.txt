instructions:
To make the pulled eggplant, first, place the whole eggplants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, pierce them with a fork , and bake in a preheated static oven at 480°F for 35-40 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: pour the barbecue sauce into a bowl, then add the cumin and garlic powder .
Add also the ginger powder and cayenne pepper , salt, pepper, and oil .
Mix to combine the ingredients . When the eggplants are cooked, remove from the oven and peel them with a knife . Shred the eggplant flesh using a fork .
Add the shredded eggplant to the sauce and mix well . Transfer the seasoned eggplant to a non-stick pan and sauté over high heat for about 8 minutes, distributing it evenly with kitchen tongs : they should be nicely glazed and toasted.
Finally, prepare the coleslaw: julienne the red cabbage and carrots using a mandoline. Combine the vegetables in a bowl, dress with mayonnaise , and mix everything together.
You are ready to assemble the sandwiches: fill the base with coleslaw , then top with the shredded eggplant while still hot and a leaf of lettuce . You are ready to enjoy the pulled eggplant !
It is recommended to consume the pulled eggplant sandwich immediately.
The shredded eggplant can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days and reheated in a pan before serving.
The barbecue sauce available commercially usually contains a small percentage of anchovy paste: you can look for the vegetarian version in well-stocked supermarkets or make it at home!
