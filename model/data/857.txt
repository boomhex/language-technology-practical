Rice balls are a beloved treat all over Italy, and here's a modern twist that offers a vegetarian-friendly version. Super tasty, right? Instead of meat, they use rice, making them lighter and kinda fun. These rice balls have a vibe that's different from the classic Sicilian arancini, with their tender texture and mellow flavor. Plus, the colorful veggies and those crispy edges—baked or pan-fried—make them perfect for a meal that feels special but doesn't take forever. Pretty simple.
And here's the thing, as far as easy rice ball recipes go, this one is a winner for busy days. They travel really really well—perfect in a lunch box (or as the Milanese say, a schiscetta) if you're tired of sandwiches. Seriously good. The combo of simple flavors and a little crunch keeps every bite exciting, while the moist rice inside ensures leftovers won't be dry.
Pairing these homemade rice balls with a fresh, colorful salad is a go-to for anyone who loves healthy salad recipes that aren't boring. Really. Add cherry tomatoes, crunchy cucumbers, and maybe some arugula or mixed greens. Can't go wrong there. The crisp, bright flavors perfectly balance the rice balls’ softer texture. And listen, people love experimenting with quick salad recipes using whatever's in the fridge. Pretty much anything works, making a plate that's both colorful and satisfying.
Plus, dipping the rice balls in simple sauces—like tangy yogurt or zesty tomato dip—ties everything together. In Italy, meals like these are often used for prep because both rice balls and salad hold up well. For sure, whether enjoyed at home or packed for work, this combo adds a burst of color and joy to everyday meals. And look, Italian-inspired food doesn’t have to be heavy to be really tasty and fun to share. No question.
To prepare the rice balls and salad, first start by shelling 400 g of pods, you will obtain 100 g of fresh peas . Then bring salted water to a boil in a suitable pot and when it reaches temperature, add the rice . Cook for 15 minutes allowing the water to evaporate, then turn off the heat and add the peas .
Mix well , transfer to a bowl and let cool completely . Meanwhile, put a pot full of water on the stove, and while it comes to a boil, trim the green beans by hand or with a small knife .
Rinse the trimmed green beans and boil them for a few minutes : we recommend draining them as soon as they soften a bit, but you can choose to cook them longer. Once blanched, drain the green beans in a bowl with ice water to stop the cooking and prevent them from losing their brightness . Then drain them as soon as they cool .
Once the rice is cold, add the egg, the grated cheese , season with thyme leaves, and adjust with salt and pepper . Start kneading by hand, gradually adding breadcrumbs .
Once the dough is ready, take portions of about 1 oz and form the balls . As you form them, roll them in breadcrumbs and finally place them on a cutting board to proceed with frying. In this way, you will get 40 pieces .
Heat the oil to a temperature of 340°F and dip 5-6 balls at a time using a slotted spoon . Cook them for a few minutes or until they are golden, then drain them on absorbent paper and continue frying all the others . Compose the dish by arranging the rice balls and the green bean and mixed salad on the plate, seasoned to taste with oil and vinegar .
Once ready, you can enjoy the rice balls and salad hot or warm, even cold they are not bad!
When fresh peas are out of season, you can use frozen ones, let them thaw in hot water for a few minutes before using them as in the recipe. The salad can be enriched with dried fruit of your choice. Finally, add cubes of cheese like Greek feta for an even more complete meal.
