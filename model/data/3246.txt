To prepare the olive breadsticks wrapped in mortadella and robiola, start by making the cream: place the robiola in a bowl, add a tablespoon of milk and mix until a thick consistency is obtained . Chop the shelled pistachios in a mixer and incorporate them into the robiola cream .
At this point, lay out the slices of mortadella and cut 3 strips from each slice . You can now assemble the snacks: take the olive breadsticks, spread them with the robiola cream (leaving a couple of inches free at one end to hold them) and wrap them with a strip of mortadella : the olive breadsticks wrapped in mortadella and robiola are ready to be enjoyed.
We recommend consuming the olive breadsticks wrapped in mortadella and robiola as soon as they're ready. If you like, you can store the robiola cream in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for a maximum of 2-3 days.
If you don't like mortadella, you can replace it with cooked ham.
