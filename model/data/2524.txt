To prepare the panzerotti with ricotta and turnip greens, start by cleaning and blanching the vegetables in salted water. Drain the cooked turnip greens, drying them as much as possible, then chop them and set them aside to cool. Cut the chili pepper lengthwise and use a knife to remove all the seeds inside , then chop it finely .
In a bowl, place the ricotta , adjust with pepper and add the chopped chili pepper: mix the ingredients well with a whisk until you get a soft and creamy consistency. Finally, add the chopped turnip greens and incorporate these well too.
Take the dough disks out of the package , remove the film they rest on, and place them on the work surface. Fill each disk with 20-25 grams (approximately 0.75-0.88 oz) of ricotta and turnip greens, placing the mixture well in the center with the help of a spoon , then slightly moisten the edges with a little water, using a kitchen brush. Now fold the disk over itself
and seal the edges by pressing them with the tines of a fork . Heat the vegetable oil to a temperature of 340-355°F and gently immerse the panzerotti with the help of a skimmer . Cook them for 4-5 minutes, they should be well golden on the surface. Your panzerotti with ricotta and turnip greens are ready , serve them hot.
Once cooked, the panzerotti should be consumed. You can store the filling for 2-3 days in the refrigerator, tightly closed in a container.
If you want to give the panzerotti a crunchy note, add toasted almond crumbs to the filling. When frying them, immerse only 2-3 panzerotti at a time to prevent the oil's temperature from dropping excessively and compromising optimal cooking.
