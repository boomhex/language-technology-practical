instructions:
To prepare the gluten-free tiramisu, start with the gluten-free ladyfingers: first, separate the egg yolks from the whites. Pour the egg whites into a bowl, add 1.4 oz of sugar , and beat them to stiff peaks with an electric mixer . In a separate bowl, pour the egg yolks and the remaining 1.2 oz of sugar .
Beat with the electric mixer until you obtain a light and frothy mixture . Gradually fold the stiff egg whites into the yolk mixture with a spatula , gently mixing from bottom to top so as not to deflate them .
Now sift the dry ingredients into the bowl little by little: rice flour, potato starch , corn starch, baking powder, and xanthan gum. Mix gently again from bottom to top until a homogeneous mixture is obtained . Transfer the dough to a piping bag with a plain round nozzle of about 0.5 inches in diameter and form sticks about 4-5 inches long on a greased and parchment-lined baking sheet .
Dust the ladyfingers with granulated sugar and powdered sugar , then bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool . Meanwhile, prepare the cream: in a saucepan, pour the sugar and water .
Bring the mixture to 250°F, measuring the temperature with a kitchen thermometer ; if you do not have a thermometer, the syrup is ready when small white bubbles form on the surface. Just before reaching 250°F (around 239°F), start beating the yolks with an electric mixer. Once 250°F is reached, pour it over the yolks in a thin stream, keeping the mixer running at low speed . Continue beating until completely cooled .
Now fold in the fresh cream and the mascarpone, one spoonful at a time . The cream is ready when all the ingredients are well combined .
Brew the coffee with a moka pot and let it cool. Now you can assemble your tiramisu: take a dish, dip the ladyfingers in the coffee and place them on the bottom to create the first layer .
Dust with a layer of unsweetened cocoa powder , then spread half of the cream . Now create the second layer: place the ladyfingers soaked in coffee .
Dust with cocoa and spread the remaining cream evenly. Finish by covering with plenty of cocoa . Let your gluten-free tiramisu set in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving !
It is recommended to consume the gluten-free tiramisu within the day or to store it for a maximum of one day in the refrigerator, in an airtight container; if you use pasteurized eggs, it can last 2-3 days.
It can be frozen for about 2 weeks in the freezer.
Xanthan gum is a thickener that helps recreate the structure normally guaranteed by gluten: it makes the ladyfinger dough more elastic, retains air during whisking, and allows the cookies to bake while remaining soft yet stable.
