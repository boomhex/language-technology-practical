Chocolate , Hazelnut Muffins , Water Muffins and even Savory : we have tried so many muffin variations that you will have an endless choice for your homemade snacks. To extend the list of our special recipe book of delights, we propose soft ricotta and lemon muffins. In this recipe, the batter is enriched with delicately flavored cow's milk ricotta, enhanced with lemon, which will give a pleasant citrus note. If ricotta is not your first choice, we suggest our Soft lemon muffins which use milk instead of ricotta in the batter!
To make the ricotta and lemon muffins, first break the eggs into a large bowl, add the sugar and the lemon zest . Whisk the mixture with an electric mixer and gradually add the vegetable oil .
At this point, incorporate the well-drained ricotta and the lemon juice . Now add the flour and baking powder, sifting them through a sieve .
Continue beating with the electric mixer until you have a smooth, lump-free mixture . Transfer the batter into a piping bag without a nozzle .
Line a 12-muffin tin with paper liners and pipe the batter into the liners until they are two-thirds full . Sprinkle with sliced almonds and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 18-20 minutes. Once baked, remove the ricotta and lemon muffins from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving .
Ricotta and lemon muffins can be stored under a glass dome for 2-3 days. You can freeze them after baking.
If you don't have paper liners, you can use a sheet of parchment paper cut into 12 squares to line the muffin tin.
