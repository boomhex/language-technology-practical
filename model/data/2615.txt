And really, with its striking appearance and really really good taste, it's easy to see why the torta a scacchi has become a beloved part of Italian dessert traditions. So here's the deal: give it a try, and you won't regret it.
To make the chess cake, start with preparing the light cake; grate the orange zest and then squeeze and strain the juice . Place the eggs, salt, and honey in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk,
the orange zest , and granulated sugar . Turn on the mixer and whip the mixture until it becomes fluffy, then slowly pour in the olive oil ,
and the orange juice . Finally, incorporate the dry ingredients: the all-purpose flour, almond flour, and previously sifted baking powder , one tablespoon at a time. Butter and line an 18 cm diameter pan with high sides of 10 cm with parchment paper, pour in the batter and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 1 and a half hours (or 320°F in a fan-assisted oven for 1 hour and 20 minutes).
Meanwhile, prepare the dark cake following the same procedure as the light one: place the eggs, salt, honey, and granulated sugar , the orange zest in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk; turn on the mixer and whip the mixture until it becomes fluffy, then slowly pour in the olive oil ,
and the orange juice . Finally, incorporate the dry ingredients: the all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, and previously sifted baking powder , one tablespoon at a time. Butter and line an 18 cm diameter pan with high sides of 10 cm with parchment paper, pour in the batter and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 1 and a half hours (or 320°F in a fan-assisted oven for 1 hour and 20 minutes).
Once baking is complete, remove the cakes from the oven, let them cool, and then remove from the pans . Divide each cake into 3 equal discs (17-18),
then cut circles from each disc using a pastry cutter with a diameter of 4.5 inches and one of a diameter of 2.75 inches , so each disc will be divided into 3 circles of different sizes. Now start assembling the cake: place a circle of light cake (the outermost one) on a serving plate, insert a medium dark circle inside, and then place a small light disc inside the dark circle. The circles will fit perfectly, creating a uniform base . Now brush the surface with the strained orange marmalade
and start assembling another layer: this time start with an outer dark circle, insert a light one , and finish with a small dark disc. Continue alternating colors and spreading each layer with orange marmalade. You will end up with a 6-layer cake . Now prepare the ganache coating: chop the dark chocolate and place it in a bowl,
heat the cream and pour it over the chopped chocolate, stir to melt the chocolate and obtain a thick cream, cover with cling film touching the surface and let it cool in the refrigerator until it becomes a firm but spreadable ganache cream.
Coat the surface of the cake and the edge with strokes of ganache, using a spatula to create an irregular, non-smooth effect . Finally, decorate the top with orange zest cut into julienne strips , your chess cake is ready to be enjoyed .
Store the chess cake in the refrigerator for a couple of days. You can freeze the cake without the coating.
To fill the chess cake, you can also use apricot jam instead of orange marmalade.
