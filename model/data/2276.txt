instructions:
To prepare ricotta and walnut pasta, start by boiling the pasta in plenty of salted water . While the fusilli are cooking, focus on the sauce: chop the walnuts , setting aside some whole halves for the final decoration. Pour the oil into a wide-bottomed non-stick pan .
Then add the ricotta . Heat over very low heat and stir with a spatula . Then thin with a ladle of pasta cooking water , you'll need about 5 oz.
Then use a hand whisk to continue stirring the ingredients well to make the ricotta creamy . Adjust with salt and pepper .
Finally, add the walnuts and mix them into the sauce , flavoring with nutmeg .
Drain the pasta al dente directly into the pan with the sauce and mix it with the other ingredients , stirring for another minute. Now the ricotta and walnut pasta is ready to be served. Garnish the dish with whole walnuts and enjoy !
We recommend consuming the ricotta and walnut pasta as soon as it's ready. If there's any left, you can store it in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 1 day.
We do not recommend freezing.
