To prepare the chanterelle rosticciata (grostl) with speck, take 4 medium potatoes, wash them well without peeling, and boil them in salted water over moderate heat for about 30 minutes (they should not fall apart). Once cooked, drain them and let them cool completely (it's better to prepare them the night before). Meanwhile, clean the chanterelles very well with a soft, damp cloth, removing any dirt residue , and if they are very large, cut them into pieces, but not too small .
Finely chop half an onion and brown it in a pan with a drizzle of oil, then add the chanterelles (4-5) and cook them on low heat until done, adding salt and a few tablespoons of hot broth, if necessary. Meanwhile, in a separate small pan, brown the speck cut into cubes or strips with a drop of oil , and set it aside.
Peel the potatoes, which will have completely cooled by now , cut them into thick slices, and place them in another pan along with the other half of the onion, coarsely chopped. Sauté them for a few minutes, then adjust the salt and pepper to your taste and continue cooking .
until they are golden on both sides . Do not turn the potatoes too often to avoid breaking them. At this point, add the chanterelles . Adjust the salt and pepper if necessary and then serve, sprinkling the chanterelle grostl with the speck .
You can make the mushroom rosticciata with speck using other types of mushrooms instead of chanterelles, such as porcini, and you can cut the speck into strips instead of cubes.
The chanterelle rosticciata (grostl) with speck should be eaten immediately or, if there are leftovers, stored in the refrigerator and consumed the following day.
For a proper selection, treatment, and storage of mushrooms, please refer to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
