instructions:
To make the vegetarian gyoza, first prepare the dough: in a bowl, mix the flour with the salt , then add the water slowly while you blend the mixture with a spoon .
Knead the dough for a few minutes first in the bowl and then on the work surface until you get a smooth and homogeneous consistency. Form a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature .
In the meantime, prepare the filling. Clean and chop the cabbage , the carrots , and the garlic cloves, removing the core .
Do the same with the green onion , mushrooms , and tofu .
Finally, chop the fresh ginger into pieces . Transfer all the ingredients into a mixer and blend to finely chop them .
Heat a little sunflower oil in a pan, then add the chopped mixture and sauté over medium heat for 10 minutes. After this time, turn off the heat and add the soy sauce and sesame oil .
Also add the sriracha sauce . Mix well , then let it cool down. Once the filling is cold, form balls weighing about 10 g each and place them on a tray .
Take the dough again and divide it into two parts from which you will make logs . Cut the logs into pieces weighing about 15 g and form balls .
Lightly flour the work surface and roll out each ball with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 1 mm , then cut the dough with a cutter of 8 cm diameter . Place a filling ball in the center .
Fold the disc into a half-moon shape , then pinch one of the two edges to form small pleats starting from the center towards the ends ; to help yourself, you can spray the edges of the dough with a bit of water. As you seal the gyoza , place them on a lightly floured tray.
You are ready to cook: heat a pan with a little sunflower oil , then place the gyoza and brown them over medium heat without ever turning them, so that only the bottom is colored; it will take about 4-5 minutes . At this point, pour the water into the pan .
Lower the heat and cook with the lid on for about 10 minutes ; cooking time varies depending on the thickness of the dough. Once cooked, remove the lid , turn off the heat and add the sesame oil .
Pour the soy sauce and rice vinegar into a bowl , mix , and serve your vegetarian gyoza with the accompanying sauce !
The vegetarian gyoza can be stored in the refrigerator for one day after cooking.
You can freeze them raw and cook them directly from frozen, increasing the cooking time.
We chose to roll the dough very thin, but you can decide to increase the thickness to get a dough that is more resistant to the bite: in this case, it will be easier to seal the dumplings, but the cooking times will be longer. Keep in mind, moreover, that the dough amount will suffice for fewer pieces.
If you prefer, you can chop the filling ingredients with a knife instead of using a mixer.
