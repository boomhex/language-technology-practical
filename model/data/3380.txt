instructions:
To prepare the linguine with bottarga and clams, start by preparing the clams: clean them by discarding any with broken shells, then rinse them repeatedly under cold running water . Now place the clams in a large colander which will be immersed in a basin full of water for about half an hour, allowing any impurities to purge . After the necessary time, drain the clams well and set them aside, then sauté two crushed garlic cloves in a non-stick pan with three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil .
When the garlic is ready, add the clams and cover them with a lid to allow them to open (this will take a few minutes) . Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the bavette, then drain them al dente .
Once the clams have opened, add the chopped parsley and the drained al dente pasta , then add the mullet bottarga by grating it directly over the pasta . Mix well to combine all the ingredients, turn off the heat, and your linguine with bottarga and clams is ready to be served.
Linguine with bottarga and clams can be stored in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to one day. Freezing is recommended.
If you desire a stronger flavor, you can replace the mullet bottarga with tuna bottarga. If you prefer, you can substitute fresh bottarga with powdered bottarga, dissolving it in a tablespoon of water before adding it to the pasta. If you wish, you can replace the linguine with spaghetti or other types of pasta. If you like, you can deglaze the clams with dry white wine before they are fully opened.
