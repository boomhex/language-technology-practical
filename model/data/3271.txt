To prepare the ravioli with sole and sea bream, start with the filling: cook the potatoes in a large pot filled with cold, lightly salted water for about 20 minutes from the boil; when they are cooked, let them cool, then peel and cut them into pieces . Meanwhile, take the already cleaned fish fillets and cut them into small pieces . In a pan, place a clove of garlic, extra virgin olive oil, and chopped parsley .
Add the fish and sauté for about 4-5 minutes , then deglaze with some white wine . When the fish is cooked, place it in a blender along with the potatoes and blend everything
until you obtain a creamy mixture . If necessary, add a drizzle of oil, then adjust with salt and pepper. Set the filling aside and let it cool completely. At this point, prepare the egg pasta that you will need to form the ravioli: on a floured surface, place the flour forming the classic fountain shape , make a hole in the center and add the eggs. .
Knead everything by hand until you get a compact mixture , cover with cling film and let it rest for at least half an hour (for more information on how to prepare egg pasta Homemade pasta (sheets and shapes) ). Now prepare the sauce: in a large pan, brown the garlic with extra virgin olive oil and parsley ,
then add the cherry tomatoes, which you will have previously cleaned and cut into quarters , and let them wilt over low heat for a few minutes. Add the cleaned clams and mussels , also cleaned, and let them open for 5 minutes over low heat (for more information on how to clean mussels How to Clean and Open Mussels ).
Wash and shell the prawns , then add them to the sauce and cook everything for 5-6 minutes ; if necessary, adjust with salt and pepper. Once everything is cooked, turn off the heat and set the sauce aside. Meanwhile, the egg pasta will have rested for the necessary time: remove it from the cling film and roll it out on a floured surface with a rolling pin. Create regular and rather thin rectangles with the help of a pasta machine ,
then transfer the filling to a piping bag and place a walnut-sized ball on the dough, spacing the next ones about 1 inch apart from each other . Brush the dough with water on the edges of the rectangle and around the filling balls ; cover with another sheet of dough, pressing well with your fingers between each filling to seal everything .
With a serrated pasta cutter, form the ravioli by cutting the dough into squares (5cm x 5cm) . Now take a tray, sprinkle it with flour or semolina, then lay the ravioli on it . In a pot, bring plenty of salted water to a boil and cook the ravioli for a few minutes ;
until they float: then drain them using a slotted spoon and add them to the sauce . Turn on the heat and sauté everything for another 1-2 minutes, then add the pesto and turn off the heat (if you want to ensure the fish doesn't overcook, you can remove it from the sauce and keep it warm, then add it back later). Stir to combine all the ingredients , adjust with salt and pepper, and your ravioli with sole and sea bream will be ready: serve and enjoy them while still hot.
You can keep the ravioli for a maximum of one day, stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. The sole and sea bream stuffed ravioli can be prepared in advance by freezing them before cooking: place them on a tray lined with parchment paper, spacing them to prevent sticking, and freeze for half an hour. After this time, remove them from the freezer and place them in a transparent food bag (this way, you will avoid them sticking to the bag), then store them in the freezer.
If you prefer, you can make the filling with other fish, such as cod or monkfish (or any other fish of your preference). If you prefer, you can shell the mussels and clams before adding them to the sauce, or use those already shelled.
