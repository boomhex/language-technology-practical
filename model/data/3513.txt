To cook sautéed Jerusalem artichokes, start by cleaning the Jerusalem artichoke tubers. First, rub your hands with some lemon juice, because Jerusalem artichokes, like artichokes, tend to darken and leave your fingertips black. Also prepare a bowl of acidulated water (with lemon juice) to immerse them once cleaned. With a small knife, scrape the skin of the Jerusalem artichokes to remove dirt and hard parts . Wash them well and immerse them in the acidulated water to prevent them from darkening. Drain and rinse the Jerusalem artichokes, cut them into thin slices about 1/10 inch thick, using a sharp knife or a mandoline and prepare a non-stick pan where you will heat the extra virgin olive oil and brown the garlic cloves cut into pieces .
Then pour the Jerusalem artichokes into the pan . Salt them, mix them to flavor, and continue cooking with the lid on for about 15 minutes, occasionally adding a ladle of vegetable broth to prevent them from drying out too much . A few minutes before the end of cooking, add chopped parsley, a good grind of pepper, and mix well . The Jerusalem artichokes should be cooked but still quite crunchy. Serve the sautéed Jerusalem artichokes hot as a side dish for a meat dish or with other vegetables.
Jerusalem artichokes can also be eaten raw, in salads, in purées, or used in the preparation of savory pies and vegetable flans.

The Jerusalem artichoke is a knobby tuber of North American origin, which was brought to Europe in the 17th century. Still little known in Italy, it is especially widespread in Piedmont, where it is consumed with bagna cauda.
