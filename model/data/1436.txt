instructions:
To prepare the leeks and eggs, first cut off the base of the leeks , then slit them lengthwise and peel them apart . Rinse the leeks under running water.
Blanch them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then drain them on a tray . Slice the Gruyère cheese and set it aside .
Take a 8x8 inch baking dish, butter it , and coat it with breadcrumbs (8-9).
Now place a first layer of blanched leek leaves at the bottom , continue with a second layer of cheese , and keep alternating layers until the ingredients are used up. Finally, salt, pepper, and season with sage leaves .
Place in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 10 minutes, then remove the pan, create indentations near the 4 corners of the baking dish and break the 4 whole eggs into these. Sprinkle the surface with grated Parmigiano Reggiano . Bake again at the same temperature for 10 minutes and then brown under the grill for about 3 minutes. Serve the pan of leeks and eggs piping hot !
We recommend consuming the baked leeks and eggs immediately.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer to make the dish creamier, you can add a few tablespoons of béchamel sauce between the layers!
