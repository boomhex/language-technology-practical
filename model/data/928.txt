instructions:
To prepare the crostino with eggs benedict and bacon, start with the hollandaise sauce: take the clarified butter, melt it in a saucepan or microwave, and set it aside. Finely chop the shallot with a smooth-bladed knife . In a saucepan, pour the vinegar , water, peppercorns, and chopped shallot .
and bring the mixture to a boil . Strain the boiled liquid, transferring it into a bain-marie saucepan (or set up a classic bain-marie if you don't have a saucepan with an integrated bain-marie) . Add the yolks to the same saucepan.
and, equipped with a whisk, beat the mixture constantly over moderate heat. Salt and continue to beat the eggs until they thicken. At this point, pour in the clarified butter slowly , taking care to continue whisking constantly until all the butter is incorporated and the sauce is “whipped” (this process will take about 6 minutes).
At this point, remove the saucepan from the heat and add the lemon juice . Set the sauce aside , keeping it warm, or transfer it to a bowl (at room temperature, not in the refrigerator). Toast the brioche bread in the oven or in a pan with a drizzle of oil .
on both sides , until golden and crispy . Sauté the diced bacon in a pan .
until they are crispy. Drain them on a platter lined with absorbent paper . Finally, focus on cooking the eggs so that they are served hot. In a pot, pour water and vinegar , heat it up, and in the meantime, crack the egg into a separate bowl, being careful not to damage the yolk. Once the water reaches a boil, stir with a whisk to create a vortex .
into which you'll pour the whole egg . Wait for the egg to rise slightly. Before removing the egg from the water, wait a couple of minutes. Lift it out with a slotted spoon , place it on a plate, and repeat the same operation for the remaining eggs. Now assemble your eggs benedict: place the arugula on the toasted brioche bread .
place the still-warm egg on top and add a generous spoonful of hollandaise sauce . Pepper to taste and garnish the crostino with diced bacon .
We recommend consuming the crostino immediately.
It is possible to replace arugula with seasonal vegetables such as baby spinach, escarole, or radicchio.
