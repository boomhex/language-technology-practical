This tasty dish from Northern Italy really turns springtime ingredients into something special: farfalle with nettle pesto . In regions like Lombardy and Piedmont, you'll find folks eagerly collecting wild nettles as soon as the weather warms up, ready to transform them into a creamy, green pesto. Nettles might seem a bit intimidating because of their sting, but that’s part of the adventure—it’s like foraging with a mission. Be sure to wear gloves when handling them, but after a quick dip in boiling water, the sting disappears, leaving you with tender greens rich in good stuff like calcium and iron.
Italians have been doing this for ages, using what’s around them to make their pasta fresh and a little bit different. Seriously good. Homemade farfalle, or bowtie pasta, really absorbs the nettle pesto pasta sauce, and every bite tastes like moist, fresh spring days. And the sauce? It's amazing.
Imagine spending a bright weekend making stinging nettle recipes like this—it’s almost like a mini adventure. People in Northern Italy love showing off their pasta-making skills. And look, swapping in nettles for the usual basil or arugula proves you don’t need fancy ingredients to create something vividly flavorful. This is the kind of dish that sparks conversation—your friends might not believe nettles can taste this good! The homemade nettle pesto offers that herby, nutty bite, and when you toss it with the pasta, you get this silky texture that's hard to beat. Some regions even add local cheeses or a squeeze of lemon for an extra tangy finish. Which is great.
Whether you call it bowtie pasta with nettle pesto or just a wild take on healthy pesto recipes, it’s a wonderful way to celebrate the season and show off a bit of kitchen creativity. Pretty simple. People love how simple ingredients from the countryside can become a dish that feels so fresh and different. Honestly, it’s a pasta you’ll want to make every spring, just to surprise everyone with a taste of real Italian tradition. Really, really good.
To make farfalle with nettle pesto, start with the fresh pasta: weigh the flour and then pour it onto the work surface (you can use a bit less flour, start with 160-180 g and add more as needed if the dough seems too soft), then add the eggs and mix everything first with a fork then continue by hand ; keep working until you get a smooth and elastic dough.
Then wrap the fresh pasta in plastic wrap and let it rest in a cool, dry place for at least 20-30 minutes. In the meantime, focus on the filling: put on disposable kitchen gloves (two pairs are advisable if they are thin), clean the nettles by removing only the tips (you will get 150 g of nettles for the recipe), then rinse them under plenty of running water , drain them
and place them in a pot with lightly salted boiling water ; cook for 10 minutes, then drain the nettles, being careful to keep the cooking water in the pot as you'll need it later , and place them in a container with ice water so they cool quickly without losing their brightness ;
Once they are cold, you can squeeze them in a fine-mesh sieve, pressing with a fork, to remove the excess water . Meanwhile, take the burrata, remove the string around the "onion", chop it roughly , and toss it into the cup of a blender along with the well-squeezed nettles and pine nuts .
Blend everything for a few moments, then start pouring in the oil in a thin stream while running the blender . Let the blades run until you get a creamy and homogeneous mixture, salt and pepper to taste, and transfer it to a small bowl . Take the fresh pasta, divide the dough into quarters (keep the rest wrapped in plastic wrap while waiting to work it), then pass the first piece through the roller of the pasta machine ,
rolling several times from the largest thickness to the second to last to obtain a very thin sheet, about 1/25 inch thick . On the obtained sheets, pass the pastry wheel to create rectangles: make vertical lines with the fluted wheel spaced 2¾ inches apart . Then, with the smooth wheel, cut horizontally every 1½ inches to obtain smaller rectangles.
To form the farfalle from fresh pasta, use your thumb and index finger: position your thumb at the center of the bottom edge of the rectangle and your index finger at the center of the rectangle; with your thumb, push the pasta edge towards the center (19-20); then with your index finger, bring the top edge towards the center as well : you will have created three folds in two moves.
Pinch in the center to define the butterfly shape and continue this way for all the rectangles and finish the fresh pasta. As you make the farfalle, you can place them on a slightly floured tray (use semolina flour if you prefer so it doesn't get absorbed by the fresh pasta). Finally, prepare the seasoning: cut the smoked bacon into strips , then dice it
and sauté in a pan for 2-3 minutes over medium heat, just enough to make them golden and crispy . Cook the farfalle in the same nettle cooking water brought to a boil ; it will take about 5 minutes. In another pan, with the heat off, pour the nettle pesto, dilute with 1 ladle of the pasta cooking water to thin it ;
Drain the farfalle and toss them into the pan with the pesto and mix with the heat off ; plate the farfalle with nettle pesto and top each plate with some crispy bacon cubes !
We recommend consuming the farfalle with nettle pesto as soon as they are ready! You can store the pesto for 2-3 days in the refrigerator, making sure to cover it with a layer of oil. If you want to store the nettle pesto for longer, we recommend freezing it in small jars. You can also freeze the farfalle, once dried, for about 1 month.
For the nettle pesto, instead of burrata, you can use stracciatella or another cheese of your choice!
