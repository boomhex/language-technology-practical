That's why the Spanish mussels recipe stands apart from mussels in tomato sauce. Here, it is like a salad—each ingredient super fresh, each bite a burst of summery flavor. The marinade, usually some good olive oil with a splash of vinegar or lemon, gives a tangy kick that keeps you coming back for more.
In Spain, sometimes they add bits of chorizo or a sprinkle of smoked paprika for an extra punch. So, you might see mussels with chorizo or mussels with paprika in various bars or by the coast.
