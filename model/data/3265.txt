So here's the deal: Tiramisù espresso totally shakes up the classic tiramisu vibe by changing what people know and love about this famous dessert. Instead of the usual ladyfingers, this version from Piedmont throws in pasta di meliga. And look, that's a biscuit made from corn flour that’s tender and a bit crumbly, with this special flavor you won't find anywhere else. Really. When you pour freshly brewed hot coffee over these biscuits, they soak up all that moist espresso goodness. So rich—but they don't fall apart. The biscuits hail from the Piemonte region, so this twist on the tiramisu recipe sticks to real Italian roots but feels new and special. It's a great pick if you love coffee and wanna try something just a tad different, but still crave those familiar, creamy layers you expect in a traditional Italian dessert .
Here's the thing: unlike other desserts that need a lot of fancy stuff, tiramisù espresso is super easy to throw together, especially if you prep the pasta di meliga ahead. Seriously, that makes it an easy tiramisu recipe to keep up your sleeve when you're in the mood for something sweet but don’t want to spend forever in the kitchen. The mascarpone and vanilla topping? Silky and kinda sweet, balancing out the strong coffee flavor with a light taste that just works. People in Piedmont have loved mixing biscuits and coffee forever, and this mashup takes the best parts of both worlds. It's a real showstopper for anyone who's a fan of espresso tiramisu or wants to impress friends with a dessert that feels both classic and totally new. Pair it with more coffee or some good company, and you've got a treat that's simple but oh-so memorable. You get that golden biscuit base, rich coffee, and cool mascarpone all in one bite—really, everything you want from a homemade tiramisu that's got true Italian character. Whether you're sharing it at a family gathering or on a cozy night in, this dessert is sure to be a hit, offering a taste of Italy that's both traditional and refreshingly unique.
To prepare the espresso tiramisu, start by making the mascarpone cream, mixing with a stand mixer or electric beater the mascarpone with the sifted powdered sugar , the cold milk and cold cream , and the seeds from half a vanilla pod (or a packet of vanillin): you should obtain a soft and well-whipped cream. Transfer it to a pastry bag with a star nozzle and store it in the refrigerator.
Proceed with making the paste di meliga ( Cornmeal Cookies for more instructions): place the fine cornmeal, sifted all-purpose flour, a pinch of salt, vanillin (or seeds from half a vanilla pod), and granulated sugar in a bowl and mix with a wooden spoon . Add the softened butter cut into pieces and grate the zest of a lemon into the mixture. Add the egg and the yolk and incorporate them well into the mixture , mixing with a wooden spoon: you should obtain a creamy, soft, and homogeneous dough.
Transfer the dough into a pastry bag with a star nozzle . Grease the sides and center of a baking sheet and line it with parchment paper; squeeze the dough directly onto it from the pastry bag, forming small round rings . Bake in a static oven at 356°F for 15/20 minutes, until the cookies are golden brown . Your paste di meliga are ready.
Now prepare the coffee using a traditional coffee maker. To get excellent coffee, fill the boiler of your coffee maker with cold water, preferably low in calcium, making sure not to exceed the safety valve (otherwise you'll get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee forming a small mound , which you will level by tapping the filter on the table with decisive movements . Do not press with a spoon, nor make holes.
Screw the coffee maker tightly (to prevent coffee from leaking from the sides as it rises), then place it over a low, steady flame, to get a rich coffee. As the coffee rises, a thick froth will form ; we recommend not letting the coffee bubble too long, to keep its aroma and sweetness intact. Your coffee is ready: before pouring it, stir it directly in the moka with a teaspoon to make it more homogeneous .
At this point, you can assemble the espresso tiramisu. Squeeze a dollop of mascarpone cream at the bottom of the glass and place the paste di meliga on top with the flat side facing up. Cover the cookie with another generous dollop of cream and pour about 1.4 oz of hot coffee around the cream . Finally, lightly dust the espresso tiramisu with cocoa powder and enjoy!
Consume the espresso tiramisu immediately. The paste di meliga can be stored in a tin box or under a glass bell for 4-5 days.
