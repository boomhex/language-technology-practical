instructions:
To make the Roman pangiallo, first, soak the sultanas in 1.3 cups of warm water for 30 minutes , then squeeze out the excess water. Dissolve 0.35 oz of fresh yeast in 3 tbsp of warm water , stirring with a teaspoon .
Form a well with the flour and add the sugar and ground cinnamon, pour in the yeast dissolved in water , and start kneading to gather the ingredients. Incorporate the olive oil as well .
In a bowl, pour the nuts (pine nuts, almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts), candied citron , candied orange , egg whites , and mix with a spoon.
Add the fruit to the dough , also incorporate the well-squeezed raisins , and knead by hand .
Moisten your hands with water and form two loaves . Lay them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , cover them with cling film, and let them rest for 12 hours in a turned-off and closed oven. After the resting time, prepare a batter with flour, oil ,
saffron, and water , mix with a spoon , and brush the loaves with the obtained batter .
They should be well-glazed all over their surface . Bake in a static oven preheated to 340 °F for 45 minutes. Once cooked, remove the pangiallo and let it cool slightly before enjoying it .
Store the dessert outside the refrigerator under a glass dome. It can be frozen after baking.
