instructions:
The Cuban sandwich —really, it's a flavorful delight—comes straight from the vibrant streets of Havana and Santiago de Cuba. It's where it all started, you know? Initially crafted as a staple lunch for hard-working cigar and sugar refinery workers. So here's the thing: this sandwich is all about layering big flavors inside a soft, crispy loaf. And look, it's traditionally packed with tender spiced pork, cooked ham, Edam cheese , and those tangy dill pickles. When pressed together, these ingredients create a moist and golden texture that's super hard to resist. Really, really hard.
Over time, this Cubano recipe made its journey from Cuba to Florida, then spread to major American cities, gaining fans and slight variations along the way. Some purists insist on using Cuban bread—sure, I get it—but a good baguette? That can soak up all the delicious mojo pork and melty cheese just perfectly. And you know what? In Miami and Tampa, there’s always this debate about what makes an authentic Cuban sandwich . Some folks add salami, others focus on a super crispy press or an extra layer of mustard.
Regardless of these variations, the sandwich stays true to its roots—a hearty meal that started as a worker's lunch in Cuba. The combination of Cuban sandwich ingredients —marinated pork, ham slices, sharp and slightly tangy cheese, and sweet pickles—keeps it popular as both street food and comfort food. Whether you grab one for a quick lunch or an afternoon snack, it’s perfect for any occasion. Just thinking about the gooey cheese melting over juicy pork can make anyone hungry. No question.
For those curious about how to make a Cubano , it’s pretty straightforward: salty, crispy, moist, with a hint of sweetness. This is why the Cuban sandwich remains a beloved choice, whether you’re in Havana, Miami, or any city that appreciates this snack. Its enduring appeal lies in its simple yet bold combination of flavors that keep on grabbing taste buds everywhere. Really, it's that good.
To prepare the Cuban sandwich, start by preparing the marinade for the meat: squeeze a lemon and an orange (1-2), putting the juice of both in a bowl. Finely chop the fresh coriander ,
crush the garlic with the back of a knife , then in the bowl with the citrus juice, add the oil along with the chopped coriander and garlic cloves. Add the black pepper ,
the cumin , the coarse salt , and mix everything with a whisk or spoon .
Place the pork loin in the bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it marinate for 2 to 12 hours , turning the meat occasionally: the longer you marinate, the more flavorful your meat will be. Then place it in a baking dish, lightly drizzle with part of the marinade liquid , and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 40-45 minutes (or at 320°F for 35-45 minutes). When the meat is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool completely .
Slice the pork loin and Edam cheese thinly, using a slicer if available (13-14) (alternatively, slice by hand, trying to make the slices as thin as possible), then cut the pickles into slices 1/8-1/6 inch thick along the length .
With a serrated knife, divide the baguette in half , then brush the crumb with melted butter on both sides . Heat a grill or griddle, then toast the baguette for 2 minutes, turning it on both sides .
Spread mustard on both sides , then slightly grill the pork loin slices for a few moments . Now you can proceed with assembling the sandwich: place the pork loin slices ,
then the cooked ham , the cheese slices , and finally the pickles, placing them next to each other .
Close the sandwich , grill it again on the hot griddle for 2 minutes on each side to make it crispy and melt the cheese. Once ready , cut each Cuban sandwich in half and serve .
It is recommended to assemble and consume the Cuban sandwich immediately.
Prepare the pork roast the day before and store it in the refrigerator: cold roast is easier to slice!
