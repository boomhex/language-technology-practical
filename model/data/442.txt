instructions:
To prepare the beetroot crackers, peel the pre-cooked beetroot and place it in pieces into a blender . Blend with the oil to obtain a smooth puree .
Pour the puree into a bowl and add rice flour , rolled oats , seeds , and salt.
Mix to combine . Continue kneading by hand on the work surface to form a dense dough. It may tend to crumble slightly, transfer it onto a sheet of parchment paper , place another sheet on top .
Roll out the dough between the two sheets of parchment paper with a rolling pin . Achieve a thickness of about 1/16 inch and then use a knife to form your crackers in the desired size . The ones on the edges will be more irregular but just as good!
Bake the crackers in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 10 minutes and let them cool. Meanwhile, prepare the cheese spread: mix the fresh spreadable cheese in a bowl with chopped chives , salt, pepper , and oil.
Mix to obtain a smooth cream . Then bake your beetroot crackers and let them cool, then enjoy them with the cheese spread .
To best preserve the beetroot crackers, we recommend a tin box: they keep well for 4-5 days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can replace the beetroot puree with other vegetable purees as you like!
