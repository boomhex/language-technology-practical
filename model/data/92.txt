instructions:
To prepare braised ossobuco, first, make several cuts in the membrane of the ossobuco with a knife to prevent them from curling during cooking . Salt the ossobuco and flour them on both sides .
Heat a generous amount of oil in a saucepan, then place the floured ossobuco in it and brown them over medium heat to ensure even browning on both sides . Once well browned, remove the ossobuco from the saucepan and set them aside .
Meanwhile, chop the celery , carrot , and onion .
Add the vegetables to the same saucepan where you browned the ossobuco and let them sauté over medium-low heat for 5-7 minutes . Once the sautéed vegetables have softened, place the ossobuco back in the pan .
Deglaze with white wine and increase the heat to let the alcohol evaporate completely, gently scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon to deglaze it. At this point, pour in the tomato passata , salt, and pepper .
Cover with beef broth and cook over low heat with the lid on for about 1.5-2 hours , occasionally checking if more broth is needed. By the end of cooking, the meat should be very tender and easily detach from the bone .
Plate the ossobuco and cover them with plenty of sauce and a sprinkle of chopped parsley . Your braised ossobuco is ready to be served !
Braised ossobuco can be stored in the refrigerator for one day in an airtight container.
