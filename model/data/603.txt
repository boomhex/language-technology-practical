instructions:
To prepare pasta with bell pepper and Taleggio cream, first wash the bell peppers. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake in a hot oven at 430°F for 30-35 minutes . After about 20 minutes, turn the bell peppers. Once ready , transfer them to a bowl .
Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to cool slightly, this step will make it easier to peel off the skin. Put a pot of water on to boil for cooking the pasta, and salt it once it boils. Cut the Taleggio D.O.P. into slices and then into small cubes .
Cook the spaghetti until al dente . Meanwhile, peel the skin off the still warm bell peppers and place them in a tall pitcher .
Add the fresh marjoram and blend , then add the cubed Taleggio D.O.P. (reserving a handful for garnishing the dishes).

Blend again to combine . Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and toss with the bell pepper cream .
Add pepper and a drizzle of olive oil . Serve the pasta with bell pepper and Taleggio cream hot .
The cream can be stored in the fridge for 1-2 days. The pasta should be served immediately.
You can use any herbs you like. It is advisable to blend the peppers while they are still warm to achieve a smooth cream.
