To fry the eggplants, we did not use batter or breadcrumbs, but just a light layer of flour which will make them pleasantly crispy and prevent the eggplants from absorbing too much oil. And if you are a fan of fried eggplants, try also:
To prepare the fried eggplants, first trim them , then cut them into slices 0.08 inches thick . Meanwhile, heat the seed oil in a pot, until it reaches a temperature of 356°F. At this point, coat the eggplant slices in flour on both sides . Shake off any excess flour.
As soon as the oil is at temperature, immerse a few slices at a time , turn them with a slotted spoon as soon as they are golden brown . Let them brown on the other side as well and drain them using the slotted spoon .
Transfer them to a tray lined with paper towels to remove excess oil . You can season them with salt as desired and serve them while still hot .
We recommend consuming the fried eggplants immediately.
You can serve the fried eggplants with an arrabbiata sauce. Simply make a sauté with oil, garlic, and chili peppers, add 8.8 oz of tomato pulp, basil, salt, and pepper and let it cook for 30 minutes. Finally, remove the garlic and let it cool before serving.
