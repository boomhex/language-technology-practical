instructions:
To prepare saffron crackers, first take half a glass of milk from the total amount, add the powdered saffron , and mix with a teaspoon . Pour the remaining milk into another glass, add the crumbled yeast, and stir to dissolve completely .
Place the flour in a large bowl and form a well in the center, then pour in the milk and yeast mixture and start mixing. Also add the milk and saffron mixture and mix again. Finally, add the softened butter
and the salt . Knead to combine all the ingredients. Transfer the dough to the work surface and continue to knead with your hands until you obtain a smooth and firm dough. Form a ball , wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rise at room temperature for 30 minutes.
After the resting time, roll out the dough with a rolling pin until it reaches a thickness of 1/25 inch . Transfer the resulting sheet to a baking tray lined with parchment paper and cut it into squares using a pastry wheel . At this point, cover the baking tray with plastic wrap and let it rise for another 30 minutes or so.
After this time, bake the crackers in a preheated fan oven at 320°F for about 15 minutes, placing the baking tray on the middle rack. Once cooked, remove the tray from the oven and let cool , then you can spread your saffron crackers with crescenza and garnish them with a few saffron threads !
Saffron crackers can be stored in a tin box for up to a week. Freezing is not recommended.
You can garnish the saffron crackers with your favorite ingredients or enjoy them on their own to better savor the unique taste of this spice!
