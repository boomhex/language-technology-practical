instructions:
To prepare the coffee muffins, first make coffee with the moka and let it cool. In a bowl, pour the softened butter and sugar , work with electric beaters until you get a creamy mixture. Turn the beaters on again and add the first egg .
Wait until it is completely absorbed before adding the next one . It is important that all ingredients are at the same temperature. Now sift the flour , baking soda, and baking powder directly into the bowl.
Add the pinch of salt and turn on the beaters again to incorporate the powders . You will notice that the batter will become more consistent, so thin it with the room temperature coffee poured in a stream . At this point, the mixture will be soft and compact.
Place the paper liners in a muffin pan and using a spoon, fill them 2/3 full with the batter you just made , leaving less than half an inch from the edge . You will need to pour about 2.3 oz (approximately 65 g) of batter for each muffin. Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F (180°C) for 25 minutes in the center rack. Remove the muffins and let them cool slightly. At this point, your coffee muffins are ready to be enjoyed.
Coffee muffins keep for a maximum of 2-3 days under a glass dome. If you like, you can freeze the cooked muffins, then let them thaw as needed and warm them slightly in the oven before serving.
Instead of a spoon, you can use a pastry bag. It will be easier to fill the liners!
