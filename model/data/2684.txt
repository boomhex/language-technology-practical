To prepare the tres leches cake, preheat the oven to 350°F and start preparing the base: separate the egg whites from the yolks, slice open a vanilla pod and scrape out the seeds ; then add them to the bowl with the yolks along with the sugar . Beat the ingredients with an electric mixer .
In a separate bowl, sift the flour , add the baking powder , and gradually incorporate the dry ingredients into the egg and sugar mixture .
Place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer, add a pinch of salt , and beat them to stiff peaks . Then, fold them into the egg mixture using a spatula, moving from top to bottom to avoid deflating them.
Butter and flour a 10-inch diameter cake pan and pour the mixture inside . Level it out and bake the cake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 40 minutes (or in a convection oven at 320°F for about 30 minutes). Once baked , remove it from the oven and let it cool to room temperature.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, pour the condensed milk, the fresh milk , and the fresh liquid cream . Whisk all the ingredients to combine them ;
when the cake is cool, cut it into even slices : this way it will better absorb the soaking made up of the three milks, which you can distribute with a ladle . Once soaked, place the cake in the fridge covered with plastic wrap for at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, whip the cream with the powdered sugar ,
transfer it to a piping bag with a star nozzle and after the resting time of the cake, decorate it with dollops of cream . Serve the tres leches cake in slices!
Store the sponge cake in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap. The cream can be stored for about 12 hours in the piping bag in the refrigerator. Freezing is not recommended.
There are many versions of the tres leches cake, some include a filling of chantilly cream or canned peaches, for example. To contrast the sweetness of the cake, you could garnish with some tart fruit like raspberries!
