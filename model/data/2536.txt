To make the toffee candies, chop the milk chocolate , then in a non-stick saucepan, pour the glucose and the sugar , turn on the heat, and stir gently.
When the mixture reaches a boil, pour in the cream and start mixing with a hand whisk . With the help of a kitchen thermometer, check that the temperature of the mixture reaches 244°F .
Once the mixture has reached the necessary temperature, add the previously chopped milk chocolate and the butter . With the hand whisk, thoroughly mix all the ingredients to obtain a homogeneous and smooth mixture .
Place 3 square pastry rings 3x3 inches on a tray lined with parchment paper (or baking paper) and fill each with the mixture, using a ladle . At this point, place the tray in the refrigerator for 3 or 4 hours, so the mixture solidifies. After this time, transfer the toffee molds to a cutting board and gently remove the mold. Cut the mixture first into lozenges ,
then make squares that weigh about 0.35 oz each . After wrapping them individually with parchment paper , the toffee candies will be ready to be enjoyed
You can store the toffee candies in an airtight container at room temperature for about ten days.
Try flavoring the toffee candies by adding vanilla bean seeds, cinnamon, or a bit of orange zest during cooking: you will be amazed.
