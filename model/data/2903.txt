To prepare the breadsticks with delicate truffle cream, start with the potato cream: wash them under running water to remove the dirt, then place them in a large pot and cover them with water . Cook them for about 40 minutes or until you can pierce them with a fork. Once cooked, peel them and pass them through a food mill collecting the pulp in a small bowl. Salt and pepper to taste then transfer the mashed potatoes into a large pot and add the grated nutmeg .
At this point, pour the warm milk or warm cream slowly stirring with a wooden spoon and cook over low heat, continuing to stir until the cream has thickened (it should coat the spoon). If it becomes too thick, you can add more milk or cream. Once ready, transfer it into the glasses (you can use 4 oz glasses or a single container) and add the black truffle flakes . Then serve your breadsticks accompanied by the delicate truffle cream !
You can store the truffle cream in the refrigerator for up to 1 day covered with plastic wrap.
You can also add pumpkin to the cream to give an orange tint.
