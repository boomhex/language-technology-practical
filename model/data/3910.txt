instructions:
To prepare the chocolate slices with almond aroma, start by pouring the butter and half of the sugar from the total amount into a stand mixer and let it mix for a few minutes. Then separate the egg whites from the yolks, and add the yolks to the butter and sugar , keeping the beaters running until you get a soft and creamy consistency .
Meanwhile, break the chocolate and melt it in a bain-marie, or in the microwave if you prefer, and as soon as it is melted, add it to the previous mixture . Separately, whip the egg whites adding the other half of the sugar .
In the yolk and butter batter, also add the bitter almond essence and mix, then add the whipped egg whites , folding them gently from bottom to top .
Then add the flour , folding this in very delicately and always from bottom to top. Lightly butter a baking tray of 10.6x14.2 inches,
place parchment paper on it and pour the mixture ; level carefully with a spatula and then bake in a preheated oven for about 25 minutes at 356°F ; check with a toothpick and if necessary, extend the baking time by a few minutes.
Allow to cool and then unmold onto a cutting board and cut vertically and then horizontally thus obtaining small squares of about 2 inches per side . Arrange on a serving plate and then serve the chocolate slices with almond aroma.
Store the chocolate slices with almond aroma covered, for no more than 3 - 4 days, preferably in a tin box.
I like them simple like this. If you prefer, you can dust the chocolate slices with almond aroma with powdered sugar or with a mix of powdered sugar and unsweetened cocoa. They are ideal for a snack or dipping in milk in the morning.
