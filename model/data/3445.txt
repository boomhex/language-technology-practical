instructions:
To prepare codfish balls, first desalinate the cod by rinsing it well under running water and soaking it for two days in cold water, changing the water at least twice a day. Meanwhile, place the breadcrumbs in a mixer , blend it finely, and put it in a bowl . After two days, dry the cod well
then cut it into pieces . Remove the bones from the cod fillets with the help of tweezers and finely chop them with a knife, or put them in the mixer for a few seconds (5-6).
In a large bowl, place the chopped breadcrumbs, parsley, thyme, garlic , cod , and finally the grated Parmesan cheese .
Then add two eggs and season with salt and pepper. Mix well to combine everything into a compact dough. With your hands, form small balls from the mixture and place them on a tray. Prepare three bowls: one for the flour, one for the breadcrumbs, and one for a beaten egg. Roll the balls first in the flour ,
then in the beaten egg, and finally in the breadcrumbs . Fry the balls in hot vegetable oil . When the balls are golden, drain them with a slotted spoon and place them on paper towels to absorb the excess oil.
Codfish balls can also be baked: grease a baking tray with extra virgin olive oil, place the balls on it, and bake them for about 20 minutes at 350°F, turning them halfway through cooking.
