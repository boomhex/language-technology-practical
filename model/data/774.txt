instructions:
To prepare pasta with bell pepper and ricotta cream, first wash the bell peppers, remove the top with the stalk, cut them in half, and remove the seeds inside. Then slice them into strips . Wash and cut the cherry tomatoes in half .
In a pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil with a clove of garlic for 2-3 minutes over low heat . Add the bell peppers and cherry tomatoes , salt, cover with a lid , and cook for 10 minutes. Place a pot full of salted water on the stove and bring it to a boil.
When the cooking is done, remove the garlic and set aside. Cook the pasta until al dente . Meanwhile, thoroughly mash the ricotta with a fork .
Pour the bell peppers and tomatoes into a tall glass , add the basil leaves , and blend with an immersion blender .
You need to obtain a smooth cream . Pour the cream into the pan used for cooking the vegetables and drain the pasta here as well .
Add the ricotta and toss everything just long enough to mix the seasoning . Serve the pasta with bell pepper and ricotta cream piping hot .
We recommend consuming the pasta with bell pepper and ricotta cream immediately. You can prepare the cooked vegetables in advance.
For a milder flavor, you can use cow ricotta.
