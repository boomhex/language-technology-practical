To prepare the farinata of agretti, the night before put the chickpea flour in a bowl, pour in room temperature water and mix with a whisk . Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 8-12 hours .
How to Clean and Cook Agretti by removing the tough and earthy base . Blanch them for 3 minutes in boiling salted water . Drain and set them aside .
Retrieve the chickpea batter and, with a skimmer, remove the foam that will form on the surface, then mix thoroughly. Add the oil, salt, and agretti . Mix once more . Generously oil a 12.5-inch aluminum pan and pour the mixture inside .
Distribute the agretti evenly over the entire surface and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F (200°C), on the lower shelf, in direct contact with the oven, for 10 minutes, then move the pan to the middle-upper shelf and continue baking for another 10-15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oven and add a generous sprinkle of pepper . Your farinata with agretti is ready to be enjoyed hot !
The farinata of agretti should be consumed as soon as it's ready, but if you have leftovers, you can store it in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for 2 days.
If you love spicy flavors, you can add a pinch of turmeric or smoked paprika. You can substitute agretti with field greens, spinach, or lightly blanched Swiss chard. Add rosemary or thyme for a fragrant note.
