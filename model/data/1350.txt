instructions:
To make the sweet pepper pesto, first wash the peppers, then remove the top , cut them into wedges lengthwise and remove the seeds inside . Heat a grill and when it's hot, place the peppers on it and grill them for 5 minutes.
Cut the peppers into small pieces , transfer them to a food processor and give it a spin. Add the basil as well .
Pour the olive oil into the processor and give it another spin to mix. At this point, add the blanched almonds and season with salt and pepper .
Chop everything and finally add the goat cheese . One last spin and the pesto will be ready . You can enjoy it this way to fill bruschettas or to season pasta.
Store the sweet pepper pesto in the refrigerator for 3-4 days well sealed in a glass jar. You can freeze it in small glass jars to thaw as needed if you've used fresh ingredients.
Alternatively to goat cheese, you can also use robiola cheese which has a more delicate flavor.
