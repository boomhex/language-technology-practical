instructions:
To prepare the Neapolitan battilocchio, pour the flour and yeast into a large bowl , then mix with your hand. Add part of the water and mix again to absorb it completely . Gradually pour in the remaining water while continuing to knead by hand until you obtain a homogeneous mixture.
At this point, add the salt and knead to incorporate it evenly, first in the bowl and then on the work surface, giving it slap&fold folds ; the process will take about 15 minutes in total.
When the dough is smooth, uniform, and compact, form a ball, cover it with the bowl and let it rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. After this time, give it a few more folds, then cover the dough again with the bowl and let it rest for another 30 minutes. After the resting period, divide the dough with a dough cutter into 6 portions of about 10 oz each .
Take one portion of the dough at a time and stretch the edges from the outside to the inside , then roll it on the work surface to form balls and place them gradually in a proofing box . Close with the lid and let rise for about 6-8 hours at a temperature of about 64°F-75°F.
After the rising time, the dough balls will have doubled in volume . Stretch the first dough ball by gently spreading it with your hands , then press the dough with your fingers to form a disc about 7 inches in diameter, being careful not to thin the center too much .
Proceed in this way to stretch all the dough balls, then move on to filling: cut the provola into cubes , then soften the ricotta with a little milk and spread it on the surface, leaving the edges free . Distribute the provola cubes .
Add the cherry tomato sauce and the pesto . Finally, season with a grind of pepper .
Fold the dough in half to form a half-moon, then press well around the filling to eliminate all the air . Once you have filled all the calzones, you're ready to fry: in a large pot, heat the seed oil to a temperature of 356°F, then gently dip the calzone .
Fry until golden, turning the battilocchio on both sides and using a ladle to baste it with hot oil . Once evenly golden, drain and transfer to frying paper . Your Neapolitan battilocchio is ready to be enjoyed while still hot!
The Neapolitan battilocchio should be consumed right after frying.
If the dough is still wet at the end of the processing phase, you can flour it lightly and a little at a time.
If you don't have a proofing box, you can use a tray covered with slightly oiled plastic wrap.
