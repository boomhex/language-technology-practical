Seppie in nero is one of those dishes that really shows off the fun side of traditional Venetian cuisine . It’s super interesting. This Italian seafood dish has been a staple in Venice for ages, and for good reason. The deep, dark color? That's the magic of cuttlefish ink—seriously, it’s unique. When you cook the cuttlefish slowly with its own ink, you get a rich, tender seafood stew bursting with flavor. Looks wild at first, right? But don't let the inky sauce scare you off. Locals swear by it, and once you try the sea and subtle earthiness blend, you’ll get it.
The sauce is amazing. It coats every bite, making the cuttlefish extra moist and turning the dish into total comfort food from the Venetian lagoon. It’s so so good. Many folks outside the Veneto region aren’t used to seeing food this color. That’s part of the charm with seppie in nero . Plus, it’s a dish that brings people together, especially when there’s crusty bread to scoop up every bit of that black ink sauce. And here’s the thing, unlike other seafood recipes, this one feels special—there's nothing quite like the salty sea taste mixed with the deep, almost sweet ink flavor.
Some compare it to squid ink pasta, but it's way way different. This is more of a cuttlefish ink recipe with a real Venetian attitude. Around Venice, you’ll find little twists on it—pretty much—but they always keep it tender and full of that main black sauce. For anyone who loves an authentic Italian cuttlefish recipe , this dish is a must-try. It’s bold, kinda messy, and all about honest, good food straight from the heart of Venice. Whether you're a seafood enthusiast or just curious, seppie in nero offers a tasty dive into the rich traditions of Venetian cooking. For sure.
To prepare the cuttlefish in black, start by heating oil in a pan with the two whole garlic cloves and let them soften so that the oil absorbs the garlic aroma. Remove the two garlic cloves and add the cuttlefish , letting them sauté until they dry out for about 10/15 mins. At this point, add salt and pepper, then mix the cuttlefish ink with the wine to dilute it
and pour everything over the cuttlefish , let the wine evaporate and add two generous tablespoons of tomato sauce to make everything even more flavorful. Continue to cook the cuttlefish until the sauce has thickened, which will take about 20 minutes. Once cooked, sprinkle the cuttlefish in black with chopped parsley and turn off the heat. Serve them hot.
You can accompany the cuttlefish in black with grilled polenta slices. If you wish, you can also use the cuttlefish in black as a sauce for a pasta dish.
