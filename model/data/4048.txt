If you’ve ever watched a classic American movie and seen kids roasting marshmallows over a campfire—or melting them into gooey s’mores—you know just how iconic this treat really is. Soft, pillowy, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, homemade marshmallows are a whole different experience compared to the store-bought version.
Whether you're prepping for a cozy winter night, a birthday party, or filling up those Christmas stockings, this homemade marshmallow recipe will become your new go-to. And the best part? You don’t need any fancy equipment or ingredients, just a few pantry staples and a little patience.
Making marshmallows from scratch is also a fun project to do with kids, and you can customize them with food coloring, flavored extracts, or even shape cutters for a festive twist. They're perfect for hot chocolate, party favors, or just snacking straight out of the jar.
So, if you've ever wondered how to make homemade marshmallows that are ultra fluffy and full of vanilla flavor, you're in the right place. Grab your apron! We’re about to show you step-by-step how to whip up a batch of these sweet, squishy clouds right in your own kitchen!
To prepare the marshmallows, start by soaking the gelatin sheets in about 3 oz of cold water for at least ten minutes . Meanwhile, pour 80 grams (about 2.8 oz) of water into a saucepan , and add the granulated sugar .
and then the glucose syrup . Place over heat and let it reach a temperature of 240°F, using a kitchen thermometer to verify . It will take a few minutes to reach the temperature, so in the meantime, also start whipping the egg whites until stiff peaks form, using a stand mixer , or an electric mixer if you don't have one.
When the egg whites are whipped to stiff peaks and the syrup reaches 240°F, combine them by pouring the syrup into the mixer bowl while the beaters are still running. Continue beating until the mixture forms threads, meaning when you remove the beaters, you don't see a curl detaching from the mass . Retrieve the gelatin, which by now will have absorbed the water, and pour it, without squeezing, into the saucepan, letting it melt over a very low flame .
As soon as the gelatin is melted, pour it into the mixer bowl , turn the beaters back on and continue whipping the meringue until the mixture is completely cooled. In a rectangular baking sheet measuring 13x10 inches, pour a little meringue in the four corners of the pan and then lay down a sheet of parchment paper. This will prevent the paper from moving .
In a bowl, sift together the corn starch and powdered sugar and then sprinkle enough of it onto the lined pan to create an even layer , then pour in the meringue .
Level it carefully with a spatula , and on the now smooth base , sprinkle with more sugar and starch until the entire surface is covered . Let it rest at room temperature for 12 hours without covering.
After the necessary time to settle the meringue, remove it from the pan and flip it onto the work surface, using a hand to prevent it from breaking in the center . Then gently peel off the parchment paper .
Dust again with the sifted powders (starch and powdered sugar) and then cut into strips about 1 inch thick, using a sharp knife or scissors if you prefer. Then cut into pieces about 1-1 1/2 inch , thus obtaining about 50 marshmallows.
As you cut them, dip them into the remaining starch and powdered sugar mix , then shake off the excess powder by placing your pieces in a sieve . Your marshmallows are now ready to be enjoyed !
You can store the marshmallows in a cool place, away from humidity, for 2-3 days.
You can color the marshmallows with food coloring, preferably pastel shades. If instead, you want to be inspired by American movies, toast them for a few moments: they will take on a brown color and a smoky aroma!
It seems that marshmallows, or a similar prototype, were already known during the Phoenician times. This is because until the mid-1800s, marshmallow roots were used in their preparation, giving this characteristic sweet its silky consistency, particularly popular in the United States. Only from the 19th century in France was the use of gelatin in meringue introduced, allowing for the rapid spread of marshmallows! In movies, TV series, cartoons, novels, and even in a Beatles song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds talks about marshmallows... they are truly versatile artists!
