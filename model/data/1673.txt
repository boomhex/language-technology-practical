instructions:
To prepare the brigadeiro, start by evenly greasing a high-sided pot to prevent the mixture from sticking during cooking . Pour the condensed milk into the pot and turn on medium heat . Add 2 teaspoons of butter
and gently stir with a wooden spoon to melt it completely . Add the chopped dark chocolate and stir occasionally, cooking the mixture for 15 minutes: it should reach a creamy, compact consistency and detach from the bottom of the pot.
Transfer the mixture into a bowl and let it cool to room temperature. Take about 1 tablespoon of the mixture and roll it between your slightly buttered hands : with these amounts, you'll get about 20 sweets.
Form into balls and roll them in a small bowl with chocolate sprinkles . Gradually place the balls in paper liners and serve the brigadeiro .
Brigadeiros can be stored for about 10 days outside the fridge; in summer, it's advisable to keep them in the fridge.
Freezing is not recommended.
You can substitute the dark chocolate with 2 1/2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder. They can also be covered with colored sprinkles.
