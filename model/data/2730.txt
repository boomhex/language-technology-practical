To make the yogurt and chocolate glass, take the yogurt and divide it in half into two separate bowls. In one bowl, add the Coconut panna cotta with chocolate sauce and 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar , mix with a spatula to combine, and you will obtain a dark cream. In the other bowl with the yogurt, add 1/2 cup of powdered sugar
and the seeds of one vanilla bean, mix to obtain a homogeneous cream . Place a small pot on the stove and heat over low heat 1/4 cup of water, then add 1 teaspoon of agar agar and mix to dissolve it , and thicken the mixture over low heat.
When the mixture is thick, turn off the heat, temper a tablespoon of the light cream in the pot , mix, and then pour the entire agar agar mixture into the cream , mix to combine , then cover with plastic wrap and let it set in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Proceed with the chocolate cream following the same procedure: place a small pot on the stove and heat over low heat 1/4 cup of water, then add 1 teaspoon of agar agar and mix to dissolve it , and thicken the mixture over low heat. When it is thick, turn off the heat, temper a tablespoon of the dark cream , pour the entire agar agar mixture into the cream
mix to combine , then cover with plastic wrap and let it set in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Meanwhile, prepare the cookies: in a mixer, place the sifted flour, cold butter in pieces, a pinch of salt, and the brown sugar . Pulse the blades for a few moments, just long enough to obtain a sandy dough, transfer it to a bowl and add the chocolate sauce ,
mix by hand to gather all the ingredients . Once you have obtained a compact dough, transfer it onto a floured surface , shape it into a block, cover it with plastic wrap , and let it rest in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes, until firm.
After this time, roll out the dough with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface, creating a sheet about 1/4 inch thick . Now cut the dough with a spoon-shaped cookie cutter . Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake the cookies in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 15 minutes (or in a convection oven at 320°F for 10 minutes). When done, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool .
Once the creams have set, you can assemble the dessert: transfer the creams into two pastry bags with star-shaped nozzles and distribute the creams in the serving glasses, alternating them , accompany each yogurt and chocolate glass with the spoon-shaped cookies .
You can store the yogurt and chocolate glass in the refrigerator for up to a couple of days. It is possible to prepare the cookies in advance and store them in a tin box for 3-4 days, or alternatively, you can freeze the shortbread dough and defrost it in the refrigerator when needed.
For an even more indulgent version, you can garnish the glass with dark chocolate curls.
