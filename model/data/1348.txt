instructions:
To make soft cookies with apples and turmeric, first wash the apples, then cut them into wedges and remove the core . Place the sliced apples into a blender cup, add the lemon juice , and blend the mixture with an immersion blender .
You need to obtain a smooth puree . Now work on the dough: in a bowl, pour the flour and chopped butter , knead with your hands to crumble the butter, then add the sugar .
Season with powdered turmeric and start mixing the ingredients with your hands. Then add the eggs , continuing to knead, and the baking powder .
Transfer the dough to a pastry board and form a uniform and compact dough ball . Now create a roll and cut 30-32 pieces weighing about 0.7 oz each.
Roll each piece to form balls . Place the small balls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Press with your index finger in the center of the cookies to create a hollow .
Fill the cookies with the previously prepared apple puree . Sprinkle the surface with sugar and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 20 minutes. After baking, remove the soft apple and turmeric cookies and let them cool slightly before enjoying them.
Soft cookies with apples and turmeric will keep for 2-3 days under a glass dome. You can freeze the raw dough or the already formed cookies, but without the apple puree.
To better maintain their shape during baking, especially when the ambient temperature is very high, let the raw cookies firm up in the fridge before baking them.
