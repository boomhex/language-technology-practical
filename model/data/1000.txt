instructions:
To prepare pumpkin in the pan with onions and olives, start by cutting the pumpkin in half and then in half again . Peel it and remove the seeds and filaments from the inside.
At this point, cut it into slices and then into fairly large cubes . It's preferable to make cubes of the same size to maintain a consistent texture during cooking. You will get 1.5 lbs in total. Clean the onion and slice it .
In a pan, pour a drizzle of olive oil and add two cloves of garlic . Then add the onion and stir gently, trying to separate the rings . Let it cook for about 5 minutes until the onion is softened.
Add the pumpkin cubes and let them cook over high heat for a few minutes , then remove the garlic clove. Salt ,
pepper , and mix gently. Cook for 6-7 minutes. Pour in the hot water , cover with a lid , and continue cooking for about 15 more minutes.
Then add the well-drained olives . Stir again , then turn off the heat , add the mint leaves , and serve.
Pumpkin in the pan with onion and olives can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of mint, you can use parsley leaves.
You can enrich the dish with a spicy chili pepper.
