instructions:
To prepare the capon with citrus fruits, start with the stuffing: place two slices of orange and two of lemon inside. Add the aromatic herbs: thyme and rosemary .
Add the crushed garlic and then tie it to keep it compact during cooking: pass a piece of kitchen twine around the legs and tighten well. Then bring the two ends towards the breast, then turn the capon and cross the twine securing the wings .
Turn the capon again and bring the twine in front, near the neck, here make a couple of closing knots . Cut the excess twine. Set the capon aside and prepare the marinade: pour the orange and lemon juice into a bowl , add the olive oil .
Season with the crushed garlic cloves , salt, pepper, and mix .
Pour the marinade over the capon and massage it well to flavor it . Let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours (preferably overnight). During this time, massage it occasionally. After the marinating time, place a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet, distribute the orange and lemon slices
Cover the entire bottom well . Lay the capon and pour the marinade over it and the white wine .
Finally, pour in the chicken broth . Cover with a sheet of parchment paper and one of aluminum foil . Cook the capon in a preheated convection oven at 350°F and cook for about an hour.
After the first hour, remove the covering sheets and continue to cook for another 30-45 minutes, basting the capon with the cooking juices occasionally, until the skin becomes golden and crispy . The internal temperature should reach 165°F. Once cooked, remove the capon from the oven and let it rest for 15-20 minutes before serving.  Accompany the capon with citrus fruits with Roasted potatoes or Mashed potatoes .
The capon with citrus fruits can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
We recommend cooking the side of roast potatoes separately; alternatively, you can accompany the capon with citrus fruits with pan-fried potatoes!
