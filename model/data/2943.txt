Tagliatelle di frittatine verdi is a really good northern Italian dish that catches you off guard the first time you see it. Really, it does. Instead of your usual pasta, the base here is thin, tender omelettes made with eggs and bright green spinach. They're sliced into strips that look just like fresh tagliatelle fatte in casa . And listen, these little ribbons get tossed with hearty porcini mushrooms and smoky speck . The result? Deep, earthy flavors typical of places like Trentino-Alto Adige or Veneto. It's a clever twist on the classic frittata but way, way fancier on the plate—like pasta and eggs had a colorful, elegant crossover. Pretty much the kind of ricetta italiana you make when you want to impress your dinner guests with something different. Plus, you keep those familiar northern Italian flavors.
In these regions, you’ll find funghi e speck in loads of traditional dishes, but mixing them with spinach egg crepes? It feels really creative. When you take a bite, the moist frittatine soak up all the savory bits from the mushrooms, while the speck adds a crispy edge and a little hit of saltiness. What’s cool? It looks just like a pasta dish, but it’s totally gluten-free, turning simple ingredients into something that feels really special. Not your average pasta con funghi e speck . The texture is lighter, almost silky, and the colors really, really pop. Folks from Trentino-Alto Adige swear by their speck and mushrooms, so you know the flavors are the real deal.
Whether you’re into ricetta tradizionale italiana or just want a new way to serve eggs, this dish totally offers both style and taste. It stands out in the world of cucina italiana . It's got that perfect balance of homey and unexpected—pretty hard to forget once you’ve had it. The blend of ingredients is not only visually appealing but also a nod to the rich culinary tradition of northern Italy. And you know, that's awesome.
To prepare the green omelette tagliatelle with mushrooms and speck, start by washing the spinach thoroughly under running water to remove any soil residues. Drain them and trim each bunch by removing the stalk .
In a large pan, add a drizzle of oil and the peeled garlic clove . Let it brown, then remove it and add the spinach . Let them wilt for a few minutes and salt . Turn off the heat when they have softened and reduced in volume.
Then transfer the cooked spinach to a blender , activate the blades and reduce the spinach to a cream , then set them aside. Start preparing the omelette batter: in a small bowl, pour the whole eggs .
Beat the eggs with a fork and set them aside. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, sift the flour , add the salt
pour in the milk gradually and then the previously beaten eggs . In a saucepan, melt the butter over very low heat; let it cool slightly and then add it to the omelette batter .
Work the mixture with an electric mixer or a hand whisk until you get a smooth and homogeneous cream . Then add the spinach cream to the batter .
Mix with a spatula to combine the mixture (19-20). Heat a crepe pan or a non-stick pan with a diameter of 8 inches; grease the bottom with butter (use a paper towel to grease the pan evenly); then pour a ladle of the mixture .
Cook the crepe for about 1 minute or until the side resting on the bottom of the pan is slightly golden; during cooking, occasionally shake the pan to detach the crepe from the bottom. Then flip it to the other side and cook for another minute. Continue this way until the batter is finished. Gradually, you can stack the crepes on a flat plate and cover them with plastic wrap while you continue with the preparation. Then proceed to the seasoning: on a cutting board, place the speck, cut it into slices, and then into strips about 0.2 inches thick and set aside . Then proceed to clean the porcini mushrooms, gently removing the soil by scraping the stem with a small knife, then using a kitchen brush and a cloth to also clean the cap (for these operations you can consult the Cooking School: How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms ). Then slice the mushrooms to a thickness of 0.2 inches .
In a large pan, add a drizzle of oil and chop a garlic clove . Also add the previously chopped parsley and fry for a few moments. Then add the mushrooms
stir and sauté over high heat. Then, add a ladle of hot water or Vegetable broth and cook for 5 minutes. At this point, add the speck . Stir occasionally and cook everything for another 5-10 minutes.
If the mushrooms and speck tend to dry out too much, you can add a ladle of hot water or vegetable broth . Then turn off the heat and set the seasoning aside for a moment. Move on to creating the omelette tagliatelle: on a cutting board, place each omelette and roll it up . Then cut them into ribbons about 0.4 inches thick .
When you have made the omelette tagliatelle , you can add them to the pan and turn on medium heat to sauté the green omelette tagliatelle with mushrooms and speck for a few moments so that they absorb the flavors. Turn off the heat and serve the dish hot or warm !
The green omelette tagliatelle with mushrooms and speck are excellent if consumed just made. They can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 days once cooked. The omelette batter can be stored raw in the refrigerator for up to 1 day in an airtight container. The cooked and unseasoned omelettes can be frozen.
Cooking is magic: the omelette becomes a crêpe, then tagliatelle, then a wonder for the palate. Absolutely worth trying. You choose how to perfect such a delight: whether to replace speck with bacon, add some potatoes (to sauté with the mushrooms), or use other seasonings, perhaps seasonal vegetables, for a veggie version.
