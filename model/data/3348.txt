Now place a slice of tomato on 'La Bottega di Olivia&Marino' flatbreads, then a slice of mozzarella and repeat the same operation once more; close everything with a slice of tomato. Then drizzle a little oil on each tower . Secure the tower with a toothpick or a small wooden skewer and decorate on top with two basil leaves.
