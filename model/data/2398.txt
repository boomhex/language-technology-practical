To prepare risotto with vegetable ragù and pan-seared sea bass with sage, first, focus on cleaning the sea bass: first, after washing it thoroughly, scale it from the tail towards the head with a scaler or a sharp knife, then with a pair of scissors make a cut from the belly up to under the head . Remove the innards with your hands .
Rinse under running water to remove residues and blood parts , then, with a sharp knife, cut off the head and make a deep incision along the spine, always proceeding in the same direction, separate the fillet from the bone , then turn the fish and repeat the same operation.
Remove the central bone from the flesh and use tweezers to remove any remaining bones . Then, remove the skin from the sea bass with a very thin knife, sliding it parallel to the fillet , and set aside both the fillets and the fish scraps, namely the head, central bone, and fins.
Now prepare the fish stock, which you will use to cook the risotto: clean and peel an onion and cut it into quarters, then take a leek, remove the ends and green leaves, and cut it into rings. In a pot, melt the butter, then add the leek, onion, the garlic and let them wither for about 5 minutes. Add the fish scraps and let them brown for a couple of minutes, this way the base will become flavorful; remember to stir continuously so that the fish does not stick to the pot. Deglaze with the white wine ,
and once all the alcohol has evaporated, add the water gradually to cover the fish scraps, then add the peppercorns and parsley leaves , then add a pinch of salt and let it simmer for 60 minutes on low heat .
Occasionally skim with the help of a skimmer , always remembering to rinse the skimmer in clean water each time you repeat the operation. Once cooking is complete, strain the broth using a fine-mesh sieve , to remove the fish scraps used to flavor the stock. Now focus on the vegetables: chop the scallion ,
and proceed by cutting the zucchini into cubes of about half an inch , and the carrots . Also cut the green beans into small pieces of about 1 inch .
Then take a large frying pan, pour in the oil and then add the scallions , let them brown for a few minutes, and first the green beans and then the carrots. Then add the zucchini, and cook your vegetables for 3-4 minutes . Then pour in the rice ,
stir and deglaze with the white wine ; Once the alcohol has evaporated, start adding a ladle of the fish stock to the rice , being careful to add the next one only once the first is almost completely absorbed. Salt and pepper .
Only at the end of cooking, turn off the heat and add the butter to cream the risotto . While your risotto is cooking, cut the sage into strips with a knife , and place them in a pan with a drizzle of oil and the sea bass fillets .
Cook the sea bass for a couple of minutes per side , adjust the salt and pepper, and once cooked, cut it into strips and add it to the risotto. Your risotto with vegetable ragù and pan-seared sea bass with sage is ready !
It is preferable to consume the risotto as soon as it is prepared, otherwise, you can store it in the fridge for a maximum of one day, and heat it before serving. Freezing is not recommended.
