instructions:
To make the cereal cookies, take a mixer with blades and pour in the rice flour , rolled oats , brown sugar, baking powder, and baking soda .
At this point, pour in the sunflower seed oil and the mix of almonds, raisins, and hazelnuts . Blend everything to obtain a floury mixture, then add the almond milk .
Give it another spin with the blades to mix , then take a small portion of dough about 1.4 ounces and form a ball . Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the balls on it .
Press down on the balls with your hands to flatten them evenly , then bake them in a preheated oven at 356°F for about 15/18 minutes. Once baked, remove the cereal cookies from the oven and let them cool before enjoying them .
Store in a jar or a tightly closed bag and consume within 6 days. The baked cookies can be frozen.
To easily form the balls, slightly wet your hands with water, this way the dough will be less sticky.
