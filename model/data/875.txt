To make the shortcrust pastry without butter and eggs, pour the raw cane sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment along with the water . Flavor with the grated lemon zest .
Also add the grated orange zest and the salt . Turn on the stand mixer at low speed and mix for a minute, then pour in the seed oil .
Add the flour and baking soda and mix in the stand mixer again until you get a soft and homogeneous dough . Transfer the dough to the work surface and form a loaf, then wrap it in plastic wrap and let the pastry rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour. After the resting time, your shortcrust pastry without butter and eggs is ready to be used!
The shortcrust pastry without butter and eggs can be stored in the refrigerator for 5 days. You can freeze it for up to one month.
You can flavor the shortcrust pastry without butter and eggs with the seeds from a vanilla pod, cinnamon, ground ginger, or cocoa!
If you prefer, you can use granulated sugar instead of raw cane sugar, but you will get a less aromatic flavor.
If you don't have a stand mixer, work the dough by hand as quickly as possible to prevent gluten formation.
