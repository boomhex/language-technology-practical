So here's the thing, fennel cordon bleu is this delightful surprise for anyone thinking they're getting the usual meaty version. Inspired by good old French cuisine, this dish swaps in tender fennel slices. It's a fresh, veggie twist. Seriously good. The classic double breadcrumb coating gets crispy and golden in the oven, making each bite super satisfying. And inside? The fennel stuffed with ham and cheese turns melty and gooey as it bakes. Really, it's a blend of cheesy richness, savory ham, and the gentle sweetness of cooked fennel. For sure. It's a fun way to shake up the usual baked fennel recipes . Perfect for those who love comfort food with a twist. In France, and other places too, this is a go-to meal when something special but familiar is wanted.
And listen, a lot of cooks are trying different veggies in their cordon bleu, not just fennel. And zucchini, eggplant, pumpkin, and even polenta have had their moment to shine. Pretty much. Each veggie offers something unique—eggplant goes soft and almost melts, while polenta provides a heartier bite. For those who adore fennel recipes , this version is a real winner. Really really good because it lets fennel's flavor shine alongside the melty filling and crispy coating. Some folks even go vegetarian, skipping the ham for more cheese or herbs. Which is great. The double layer of breadcrumbs keeps everything together and gives that awesome crunch when you dig in. Whether you call it stuffed fennel or even a kind of fennel casserole , it's a dish that works great for family dinners, potlucks, or when you want to surprise people with something different. And here's the thing, with all the possible swaps and combos, it is easy to make this fennel cordon bleu your own and keep things fresh all year round. Really, you can't go wrong.

To prepare the fennel cordon bleu, start by cleaning the fennel: remove the green part and slice them horizontally to obtain 4 pairs of slices of roughly the same thickness . Also cut the Edam cheese into regular slices. Place a slice of ham on a fennel disc .
Add a layer of cheese and close with another slice of fennel. Dip the whole thing first in flour and then in eggs beaten with milk .


Pass the cordon bleu again in the flour and in the eggs , and finally cover it with breadcrumbs .

Mold it with your hands to keep the shape and place the cordon bleu on a tray lined with parchment paper. Continue in this way to make all the others; with these quantities, you will get 4 . Prepare the accompanying salad: remove the first leaves from the radicchio and take the base , then cut in half and into as many wedges as you can get .
Prepare an emulsion of oil, balsamic vinegar, thyme leaves, salt, and pepper . Season the radicchio with the emulsion . Chop the walnuts .

Toast the walnuts in a pan , then add them to the salad and mix .
Fry the fennel cordon bleu, no more than 2 at a time, in deep oil at 340°F . After a couple of minutes, they will be golden brown, so drain them and serve them with the accompanying salad !
It is recommended to consume the fennel cordon bleu immediately.
The double pass in flour and eggs will prevent the filling from spilling out. The filling can be changed to your liking, the important thing is to use stringy cheeses without whey (provolone and scamorza are recommended).
To prevent the cordon bleu from burning at the bottom, make sure to keep them resting on the skimmer throughout cooking.
To ensure a melting effect, it is better to keep the cheese and other ingredients cold from the fridge before starting, so they will all be at the right temperature.
The Edam is quite savory and, together with the cooked ham, will give the right kick even though no salt is ever added in the recipe: if you prefer, you can still add a pinch of salt on the surface at the end!
