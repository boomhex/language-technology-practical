instructions:
To prepare homemade powdered sugar, you will need a powerful blender with blades. Pour in the sugar and the cornstarch . Blend everything for about 2 minutes . Then stop, to let the blades cool down, and blend again for a couple more minutes.
At this point, you will have obtained a fine, airy, and palpable powder . Transfer it to a bowl and the powdered sugar is ready .
Chop 20 g (0.7 oz) of white chocolate, after grinding the sugar with the starch, add it to the mixture and continue to blend for a couple of minutes in several steps.
The combination of starch and white chocolate will allow the powdered sugar to resist moisture better, and it will last longer on desserts.
Homemade powdered sugar should be stored in an airtight jar, in a cool, dry place. It keeps well for a long time, even several months.
If after a few days the powdered sugar becomes compact, blend it again for a couple of minutes before using it!
You can use brown sugar instead of powdered sugar, but the final texture will be less palpable.
By adding the seeds of a vanilla pod to the mixture, you will get vanilla-flavored powdered sugar.
