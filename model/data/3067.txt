Crostatine alle mandorle con crema alla birra is like, honestly, a really unique spin on classic Italian desserts. These almond tartlets kick off with the usual pasta frolla base, but here's the twist—orange zest gets mixed in. It adds this subtle, tangy flavor that just works great with the sweet almond. And the sauce? The real surprise is the beer cream filling . Picture a rich pastry cream but with beer in it. Seriously, it’s moist and super aromatic, making the texture creamy and distinct.

These beer-infused desserts are awesome not only for outdoor dinners but pretty much whenever you want a treat that feels special yet not too heavy.

If you're keen on exploring different almond tart recipes, or just want something unique, this dessert is sure to impress. Your guests will probably be asking for seconds, thanks to the intriguing blend of flavors and textures that make these tartlets a standout choice for any occasion.
To prepare the almond tarts with beer cream, start by making the almond shortcrust: in a mixer, combine the all-purpose flour with the almond flour ; if you can't find almond flour, toast 1 oz of blanched almonds in the oven and then finely chop them once cooled. Add the powdered sugar and salt , the grated zest of half an orange , and
finally, the cold butter cut into pieces ; blend everything until you get a sandy mixture . Transfer it to a work surface and form the classic well in the center .
Add the whole egg and gather the ingredients with your hands, kneading to obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Meanwhile, prepare the beer custard: slightly heat the beer in a saucepan , without bringing it to a boil. In a bowl, beat the egg yolks with the sugar until you get a light and creamy mixture ;
add the sifted flour and continue to mix vigorously with a whisk to combine all the ingredients . Gradually pour the warmed beer over the yolk mixture ,
blend everything with the whisk and bring the cream to the heat, passing it through a sieve first to prevent lumps . Cook the cream over low heat, stirring continuously with the whisk ,
until it thickens : it will take about a quarter of an hour. Transfer the cream to a bowl and let it cool with a sheet of plastic wrap in contact . Take the almond shortcrust and roll it out with a rolling pin into a sheet about 1/5 inch thick .
With a round pastry cutter about 4 inches in diameter, cut out circles of shortcrust (there will be about 9), with which you will line round molds with a diameter of 3 inches and edges about 1 inch high . We used non-stick molds; if yours are not, remember to butter and flour them first. Prick the bottom of the almond shortcrust with the tines of a fork and proceed with blind baking (see our How to do blind baking ): place a sheet of parchment paper inside the tarts and
fill them with dry legumes, so that the pastry does not puff up during baking . Bake them in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 15 minutes (if ventilated 320°F for 10 minutes), then remove the beans and continue baking for another 5 minutes. Remove the tarts from the oven, let them cool, and then remove them from the molds. Transfer the beer cream to a piping bag with a star tip and fill the tarts with it . Halve the passion fruits , soften the pulp by stirring it a little with the spoon, then
pour some pulp over each tart . Decorate with a few fresh mint leaves and flaked almonds : and here are your almond tarts with beer cream ready !
Store the almond tarts with beer cream in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to 3 days; freezing is not recommended. You can store the raw almond shortcrust in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, or freeze it and use it as needed; you can store the already baked shortcrust baskets in a tin box or under a glass dome for 1-2 days. You can store the beer cream in the refrigerator for 2 days, covered with a sheet of plastic wrap in contact.
The tarts have a particular flavor thanks to the combination of beer and passion fruit, but if you don't like this taste, you can change the filling with a more classic custard accompanied by your favorite fruit.
