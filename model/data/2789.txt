To prepare the lasagna with scampi, cherry tomatoes, and fava bean pesto, start by cleaning the scampi: the shells will be used for the stock, while the scampi are for the filling. Use scissors to cut along the back of the scampi , gently detach the head , and shell them .
Cut each scampi lengthwise and gently remove the central black thread , the scampi's intestine, to discard it. Clean the leek and remove the outer part, then cut it into thin rings .
At this point, start preparing the stock: in a pan, pour a drizzle of oil and the peeled garlic clove, halved and deprived of the green sprout; then add the leek and let it wilt over low heat for a few moments, stirring with a wooden spoon. Also add the scampi shells , deglaze with the white wine , and let it evaporate.
Now add the parsley and water to cover everything ; let the stock cook for at least 30 minutes over low heat, covered with a lid: at the end of cooking, the liquid should be reduced by half. In the meantime, prepare the Broad bean pesto (Marò) : shell the fava beans by gently opening the pod and also remove the outer skin .
Then pour the fava beans into the mixer along with the cheese and mint leaves , then add the oil . Blend everything until you obtain a homogeneous mixture : store it in a small bowl covered with oil or with cling film in contact while continuing with the preparation.
Focus on cooking the confit cherry tomatoes and the scampi: first finely chop the fresh thyme , garlic, and take the dried oregano. Separately, cut the cherry tomatoes in half and remove the seeds . In a large pan, place the cherry tomatoes side by side with the hollow side facing up ;
season them with the mixture of oregano, thyme, and garlic, then sprinkle with sugar and salt, finally drizzle the tomatoes with a little oil . Turn on the heat to the minimum and let them cook for 10-15 minutes to soften without melting; 3 minutes before turning off the heat, add the shelled scampi .
Once the stock is ready, transfer all the contents of the pan (liquid and shells) into the mixer and blend. Then strain everything and collect the liquid in a bowl and dissolve a tablespoon of tomato paste in it ; you should get about 3 cups of stock that will be used to prepare the béchamel.
In a pan, pour the butter to melt over low heat, then add the flour gradually , stirring with a whisk to create the roux. When the mixture is well browned and the roux has turned an amber color, add the scampi stock in a stream , continuing to stir with a whisk and let it thicken over moderate heat until it becomes creamy like a light béchamel .
Now that you have all the preparations, assemble the lasagna: grease a 12x8 inch baking dish , then pour a layer of scampi cream and place 3 lasagna sheets on the bottom of the dish . Continue with another layer of scampi cream;
thin the fava bean pesto with a little water to make it creamier and pour a layer over the scampi cream ; season with the scampi and cherry tomato mixture .
Then continue repeating the layers: first the scampi cream, then the lasagna layer , the fava bean pesto, the scampi, and the cherry tomatoes, until you finish the ingredients. Sprinkle the surface with chopped thyme and oregano . Cook the lasagna in a preheated static oven at 390°F for about 20 minutes (350°F for 15 minutes if using a convection oven). Once cooked, leave the lasagna in the off oven for a few minutes to let the sauce set better. Then remove them from the oven and serve them hot!
You can store the lasagna with scampi, cherry tomatoes, and fava bean pesto, covered with cling film or in an airtight container for 1-2 days. They can be prepared the day before, kept in the refrigerator covered with cling film, and cooked the next day. They can be frozen, only if all fresh ingredients have been used, preferably raw: to cook them, just defrost them in the refrigerator about 24 hours before and then bake.
If you prefer, you can deglaze the crustacean stock with brandy instead of white wine and use shrimp or prawns instead of scampi!
