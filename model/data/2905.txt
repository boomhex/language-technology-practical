Sfoglie classiche con bresaola alla vinaigrette? Now that's the kind of antipasto italiano you want when you’re craving something crispy and fresh without too much fuss. These light, flaky sfoglie classiche —which are sorta like little sheets of puff pastry—are topped with thin slices of bresaola , that delicious cured beef from Lombardia. And the vinaigrette? That's where the magic happens. It's a mix of oil, lemon, vinegar, and salt, but in Lombardia, folks love to get creative with it. Maybe swap in balsamic vinegar for a deeper, tangy flavor. Or you could add mustard or fresh herbs for a little kick. Really, it's up to you.
Whether it’s a lazy weekend or a gathering with friends, this ricetta sfiziosa is a go-to for an aperitivo veloce . It’s simple yet feels special—especially when you put your twist on the vinaigrette. Some people mix in rosemary, thyme, or even a touch of honey for a sweet hint. The whole dish is a classic from northern Italy, but with that French sauce, it feels a bit international. For sure.
If you’re after something light, this tender snack is a great choice. The antipasti con bresaola always grabs attention since the moist meat pairs beautifully with the crunchy layers. And look, you can just set out a plate and let everyone help themselves. Perfect as finger food . Plus, it's a ricetta facile that seems more time-consuming than it actually is. Really, just play around with the dressing—add what you like—and you’ve got a fantastic starter that fits right in at any relaxed gathering. It’s all about enjoying the moment, making something that’s both tasty and effortless, bringing together the spirit of Italian and French culinary fusion. Seriously good.
To prepare the puff pastries with bresaola and vinaigrette, start with the sauce: finely chop the aromatic herbs and set them aside. Then, in a small bowl, emulsify the oil with the vinegar and salt, mixing with a fork; if you wish, you can also add a few drops of lemon juice . Then add a level teaspoon of the aromatic herbs to the emulsion
and mix again to blend the ingredients . Then cut the bresaola slices into strips about 1/4 inch thick . Gather them in a small bowl and use a teaspoon to add the vinaigrette .
Mix the bresaola strips and let them marinate for 5-10 minutes. Then place a tuft of bresaola strips with vinaigrette on each pastry and garnish as desired, for example with thyme leaves, before serving your classic puff pastries with bresaola and vinaigrette !
The classic vinaigrette pastries can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days, in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
You can enrich the vinaigrette as you like, for example by replacing the wine vinegar with balsamic vinegar or adding mustard, pepper, and other flavors you enjoy!
