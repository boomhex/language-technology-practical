instructions:
To prepare the chocolate chip cake, first pour the eggs into a bowl . Start whipping them with an electric mixer , and when they become foamy, add the sugar .
Continue whipping with the electric mixer until you get a stable mixture. Then add the oil all at once .
Add the ricotta and work with the electric mixer to incorporate it . At this point, add the flour all at once ,
then proceed with the baking powder , salt , and lemon zest .
Mix with the mixer to combine all the ingredients until you get a smooth and thick mixture . Pour in half of the chocolate chips and mix with a spatula to incorporate them .
Then pour the batter into a 20 cm mold previously lined with parchment paper . Level the surface and distribute the remaining chocolate chips on top .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 40 minutes. Do the toothpick test before taking the cake out of the oven . Let it cool, then remove the cake from the mold and serve it .
The chocolate chip cake keeps for 3-4 days under a glass dome.
Dust the cake with powdered sugar before serving and add vanilla extract to the batter for extra aroma!
Granulated sugar can be replaced with brown sugar, and the result will be slightly more rustic.
You can use melted butter, considering that 80 g of oil corresponds to 100 g of butter.
You can make muffins and plumcakes with this recipe, but you will need to adjust the baking times.
Add cinnamon, citrus zest, or vanilla
It's preferable to use a static oven, but if you don't have one, slightly reduce the temperature and bake for a few minutes less. If the cake darkens too much, cover it with a sheet of aluminum foil.
