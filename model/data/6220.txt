instructions:
Italian meringue is a basic pastry preparation known for its stable, smooth, and velvety consistency, perfect for decorating your desserts in a spectacular way or for preparing elegant spoon desserts. Unlike other versions, it is made by adding a hot sugar syrup to the whipped egg whites, a step that makes it suitable for use raw, as well as more structured and irresistibly soft. It is the ideal choice when you want to give a professional look to your creations because it holds its shape perfectly and is easily workable with a piping bag. Once ready, you can use it as it is or give it a golden touch with a blowtorch for a always-inviting 'brûlé' effect! This contrast between the soft interior and caramelized exterior is what makes Italian meringue so beloved by those who want to impress with a dessert crafted with meticulous detail. Perfect for garnishing cakes, tarts, mousses, or semifreddos, Italian meringue is a versatile base that will be useful in many preparations, both classic and creative.

Here are some ideas for using Italian meringue:

To prepare Italian meringue, first pour the egg whites into the stand mixer , ensuring there are no traces of yolks, otherwise they will not whip. Start the machine at low speed. Meanwhile, prepare the syrup: in a saucepan with a thick bottom, pour the water and sugar . Turn on the heat and let the sugar dissolve, monitoring the temperature with a candy thermometer .
When the syrup reaches 250°F, pour it into the stand mixer , increase the speed and continue to whip until the meringue has cooled down. It will be ready when it has the appearance of shaving foam and when you detach the whisks, a peak with a tip, the so-called 'bird's beak,' will form. Transfer everything into a piping bag with a plain tip. We made a lemon curd tart and decorated it with some Italian meringue tufts flamed with a blowtorch !
Italian meringue can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, in a piping bag or on the already decorated dessert.
When pouring the hot syrup into the egg whites, let it flow in a thin stream along the side of the bowl, avoiding direct contact with the whisks: this way, the syrup will not cool too quickly and will incorporate evenly.
If you want to flavor Italian meringue, you can add a few drops of natural essence: vanilla, orange blossom, or a citrus touch with grated lemon or lime zest. In small doses, of course, so as not to alter the delicate structure of the meringue.
