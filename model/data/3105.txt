To prepare baked vacherin with herbs, start by placing a tablespoon of oil, a garlic clove, and half of the rosemary in a bowl, which will be used to flavor the potatoes accompanying the vacherin. Use a kitchen brush to coat the potatoes with the flavored oil , add salt , and
wrap the potatoes in a foil with aluminum wrap . Bake the foil-wrapped potatoes in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 50 minutes (or in a ventilated oven at 356°F for 40 minutes). Chop the remaining rosemary and set it aside.
Now take the vacherin wheel, carve a circle on the top with a knife and lift the crust . Season the vacherin with white wine
a teaspoon of oil, the chopped rosemary, and the thyme leaves . Close the wheel with the crust , wrap the vacherin with aluminum foil , and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 25 minutes (or in a ventilated oven at 356°F for about 20 minutes). After the required time, take your baked vacherin with herbs out of the oven and serve it piping hot and melted with the foil-baked potatoes.
It is recommended to eat baked vacherin with herbs hot, at the moment. It is not recommended to store it in the refrigerator or freezer.
Vacherin mont-d’Or is a Swiss PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) soft cheese, often used for fondues. It is produced in the Joux valley from late September to April. Aging occurs in traditional cellars, and once matured, it releases a very particular flavor, given precisely by the packaging used for conservation, made of spruce wood, which releases a tannic aroma.
Monstrously good and soft, baked vacherin should be eaten at least once in a lifetime like in Switzerland, that is, accompanied with the typical salted meat, Viande des Grisons. If you can't find it, don't despair: good bresaola will have almost the same effect.
