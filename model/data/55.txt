instructions:
To prepare the original Caprese ravioli, start with the fresh pasta: pour the flour on the work surface and form a well, then add the boiling water in the center . Start incorporating the water with a spoon and continue kneading by hand .
Continue working until the dough becomes smooth and homogeneous. Form a dough ball , wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest for half an hour in the refrigerator, so it will be easier to work with. In the meantime, prepare the filling: cut the caciotta into cubes .
Blend it in the mixer until you get a sandy mixture , then add the eggs and grated Parmigiano Reggiano .
Flavor with lemon zest and blend until you obtain a homogeneous mixture . Add the marjoram as well.
If it seems too compact, add a splash of water , then salt and transfer the mixture into a piping bag without a nozzle. Let the filling rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Prepare the sauce: in a pan, sauté the garlic clove with the oil .
Remove the garlic and pour in the tomato sauce, season with a pinch of salt, and let it cook for about 15 minutes on low heat. Meanwhile, take the dough .
Take a portion and roll it out with a rolling pin to flatten it , then pass it through the pasta machine rollers starting from the widest setting until you obtain a sheet 1/32 inch thick .
With a 2.4-inch pastry cutter (with the cutting edge facing up), lightly press the dough to obtain circles that will guide you practically in the composition . In the center of these circles, squeeze dollops of filling .
Cover with another sheet of the same size and press the pasta around the filling to release air , then seal them with the same pastry cutter .
Now cut the ravioli with a 3.1-inch fluted pastry cutter ; with these doses, you will get about 24 ravioli . Now pour the cooked sauce into a large pan and fragrance with fresh basil .
Boil the ravioli in salted water for about 5 minutes , taking care to gently turn them during cooking, then drain them and transfer them directly into the pan with the sauce .
Let them flavor for another minute, then add a few more fresh basil leaves . Plate and finish with grated cheese and basil leaves. Your original Caprese ravioli are ready to be served !
We recommend consuming the Caprese ravioli immediately after cooking.
The best way to store them is raw: place them first on a tray and let them harden in the fridge for a couple of hours, then transfer them into convenient freezer bags, this way they won't stick together. You can then cook them from frozen.
To achieve perfect ravioli, make sure to seal the edges well, removing all the air: this will prevent them from opening during cooking and result in softer, more uniform pasta.
