When it comes to gratineed Belgian endive , this dish really shines in Italian winter kitchens, especially up north where folks love their cozy sides. Italians call it "indivia belga" or "cicoria di Bruxelles." Pretty simple, right? It’s got a nice crunch when raw, but, to be honest, the real magic happens once it’s topped with a golden, herby crumb and baked just right. The aroma of oregano gives the Belgian endive gratin its unique Italian twist. Really, it's that crunchy crust that sets it apart from your usual baked veggies. It’s a go-to when you want something original yet easy. Low in calories, big on flavor—this dish shows off how Italians turn basic ingredients into something special.
Unlike classic French versions like endive au gratin or richer casseroles with ham and cheese, the Italian style stays lighter. The moist interior shines against the crisp top. In some areas, folks might toss in a little cheese or swap the crumb coating for a seasoned breadcrumb mix, but it’s always that crunchy bite that gets everyone excited. Seriously good. This dish is perfect for sharing as a side, especially when people crave something a little fancy without the fuss. Italians love using seasonal produce, and this is a top pick when it’s chilly, offering that blend of warm and crispy with every bite. For real.
Whether you're new to baked endive recipes or just need to shake up your usual sides, this dish will make even non-endive fans come back for seconds. It’s a great example of Italian cuisine's ability to highlight seasonal, genuine ingredients, creating something both simple and refined. So, next time you're in the mood for something delicious and easy, give this a shot and enjoy a true taste of Italy—no question.
To prepare the gratinated Belgian endive, first preheat the oven to 392°F in static mode, then rinse the heads of Belgian endive under running water and cut them in half lengthwise with a knife . Set the endive aside and proceed with preparing the breadcrumb mixture: cut the stale bread into cubes, then pour it into a blender and blend it to crumble it uniformly .
Transfer the crumbled stale bread into a bowl, add the grated Parmesan and oregano , then season with salt and pepper and mix everything well. Now take a baking tray lined with parchment paper and place the Belgian endive you cut earlier with the outer side facing down .
Spread the breadcrumb mixture over the Belgian endive trying to cover it entirely , then add a drizzle of oil and bake in a static oven at 392°F for about 15 minutes, until the breadcrumb mixture is beautifully golden . Your gratinated Belgian endive is ready to be served!
It is recommended to serve the gratinated Belgian endive immediately, or store it in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for a maximum of 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Customize the gratinated Belgian endive recipe according to your tastes: Pecorino cheese instead of Parmesan for a stronger flavor, sweet or smoked paprika instead of oregano for a spicy note… or choose your favorite herb!
The Belgian endive is one of the few vegetables whose date of birth is known: around 1850, a botanist named Brézier learned that a farmer had unintentionally left some wild chicory roots in a dark cellar, which had produced elongated white sprouts with a pleasant taste. Brézier continued this experiment, managing to improve the quality of the product until, in 1879, Belgian endive officially made its first appearance at the central markets of Paris!
