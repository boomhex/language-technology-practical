instructions:
To prepare the orzo with leeks, robiola, and hazelnuts, first take care of the leeks. Remove the roots and the green parts , with which you can make a vegetable broth. Cut the leeks in half and then into very thin slices .
In a pot, pour the oil and add a pat of butter and the leeks . Season with salt and stew for at least 5 minutes.
When the leeks are soft, add the orzo , give it a stir to quickly toast it, then pour in vegetable broth to cover.
Add the sage and cook. Remove the sage and, off the heat, add the robiola .
Add the pepper , grated Parmesan cheese , and stir. Plate and season with another sprinkle of pepper .
Finish with the hazelnuts , some fried sage leaves , and a drizzle of raw oil. The orzo with leeks, robiola, and hazelnuts is ready to be enjoyed !
The orzo with leeks, robiola, and hazelnuts should be consumed as soon as it is prepared; however, if you have leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for 1 day.
If you love stronger flavors, you can add crispy pancetta or sliced speck: their smoky taste pairs well with the sweetness of the leeks. You can replace the hazelnuts with toasted walnuts or almonds.
For this recipe, you can use Cervere leeks, a Piedmontese variety with a sweet and delicate flavor, with a long, white, and fibrous stem. Tender and versatile, they are ideal both raw and cooked.
