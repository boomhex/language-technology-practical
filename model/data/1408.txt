instructions:
To make the poured cake, first place the brown sugar into a bowl, add the eggs , and mix with an electric mixer until you get a light mixture. At this point, also incorporate the vegetable oil .
Add the all-purpose flour , cornstarch, sifted baking powder , and almond milk .
Finally, incorporate the hazelnut flour and mix with a spatula until the batter is well combined . Pour half of the batter into a bottomless 8-inch diameter mold placed on a baking tray lined with parchment paper .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 8 minutes. Remove the tray from the oven but do not turn off the oven , pour the jam on top , and spread it with a spatula. Cover with the remaining batter , being careful not to mix it with the jam underneath.
Level the surface with a spatula and bake again for another 30 minutes. Once baking is complete, remove the cake from the oven , let it cool, then remove it from the mold by running a sharp knife around the edge to better extract the ring .
Flip the cake onto a serving plate . Now place sheets of paper on the surface of the cake, without covering it entirely, creating a geometric pattern by dusting powdered sugar over the uncovered parts . The poured cake is ready to be enjoyed .
The poured cake can be stored for 2 days at room temperature under a glass dome.
If you do not have a ring mold, you can also use a springform pan or a classic cake pan with straight sides. You can vary the jam flavor to fill your poured cake, but we do not recommend using creams for this recipe as they may require different measurements and procedures.
