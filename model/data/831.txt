instructions:
To make the pierogi, first cook the potatoes in boiling salted water; it will take about 30 minutes, the time may vary depending on the size . Meanwhile, prepare the fresh pasta: in a bowl, pour the flour, salt , and the lightly beaten eggs .
Add the water and mix with your hands to combine the ingredients , then transfer the mixture to a work surface and knead for a few minutes to obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough . Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
When the potatoes are cooked, mash them in a bowl using a potato masher, then add the ricotta , salt, and pepper . Knead everything to obtain a homogeneous mixture . Cover with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator.
Now take the dough and roll it out to a thickness of about 1/16 inch with the help of a pasta machine . Cut out circles with a pastry cutter with a diameter of about 3 inches and fill each with approximately 0.7 oz of filling .
Fold the circle in half to form a half-moon and press the edges with your fingers , then seal with the tines of a fork ; with these quantities, you will get about 40 pierogi. As they are ready, transfer the pierogi to a lightly floured cloth . Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil.
Once formed, cook the pierogi in boiling salted water for about 5 minutes . Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan and chop the chives .
Drain the pierogi into the pan with butter and toss them for a couple of minutes, adding a little cooking water . Serve the pierogi with a tablespoon of sour cream and chives to taste !
Pierogi can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container. You can freeze them before cooking and then cook them directly from frozen.
If you don't like sour cream, you can season the pierogi with onions stewed in butter!
