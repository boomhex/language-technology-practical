To prepare the skull cookies, start by placing the all-purpose flour, hazelnut flour , and sugar in a bowl. Mix with a whisk ,
add the butter cut into pieces and start kneading with your hands . In a small bowl, beat the egg with the salt, adding the seeds from the vanilla pod ;
pour everything into the bowl and continue kneading . Now transfer the crumbly mixture onto a lightly floured pastry board and knead with your hands until you get a soft and compact dough .
Slightly flatten the dough with your hands , cover it with plastic wrap , and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour. After the necessary time, flour the pastry board again and roll out the dough with a rolling pin until it is about 3/8 inch thick .
Use a cookie cutter to form discs with a diameter of 2 3/8 inches and press with your fingers on two sides of the disc to create the shape of a skull . Use the handle of a wooden spoon to form the eye sockets and a toothpick (or a knife) to draw two lines that will form the nasal cavities .
Finally, use the pine nuts to create the teeth, as shown in the picture . Now place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake them in a preheated oven at 356°F for 20 minutes. Once baked , let them cool on a wire rack: your skull cookies will be ready to enjoy in no time!
Store your cookies in a tightly closed tin box for 4-5 days.
If you wish, you can replace the hazelnut flour with the same amount of almond flour.
