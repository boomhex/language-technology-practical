To prepare the gnocchi with tub gurnard, start by washing and boiling the potatoes in plenty of water, salted to taste . It will take about 30-40 minutes of cooking depending on the size of the potatoes. You can pierce them with the tines of a fork to check the level of cooking before draining them. Meanwhile, while the potatoes are cooking, you can clean the fish: gut it by cutting along the entire belly , remove the entrails then rinse well under water to remove all impurities.
Cut off the fins, then remove the tail and the head , and cut along the back close to the backbone to obtain two fillets . Check that there are no remaining bones in the fillets obtained.
Cut the fish fillets into coarse pieces ; also chop a clove of garlic , then wash and cut the cherry tomatoes .
In a non-stick pan, pour a drizzle of oil, add the chopped garlic and dry chili , sauté over low heat, then add the fish , sauté over high heat for about 2-3 minutes. Add the cherry tomatoes and salt to taste. Continue cooking over low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, start preparing the gnocchi, with the potatoes still hot. Create the classic well on a work surface with the flour (you can use 2 1/2 cups and see later if you need the other 1/3 cup) and a pinch of salt . Make a hole in the center and mash the potatoes , then add an egg .
Mix everything together with your hands (17-18), knead until you get a soft and homogeneous dough, cut off a part of the dough ,
gradually form logs then cut them into pieces ; finally roll each piece on the gnocchi board . Your gnocchi are ready, you can gradually place them on a slightly floured tray.
Bring a pot of water to a boil, pour the gnocchi a little at a time to cook them and drain them when they rise to the surface , then toss them into the pan with the sauce , sauté the gnocchi in the pan for a few moments, turn off the heat, and finish with a bit of chopped parsley . Serve your gnocchi with tub gurnard hot.
It is recommended to consume immediately once ready.
You can freeze only the raw gnocchi; in this case put the tray in the freezer and after about 20 minutes place the potato gnocchi in a food bag, and continue this way until they are all frozen.
To cook them, just throw them in boiling salted water without thawing them first, being careful to cook a few at a time otherwise the water temperature will drop and the gnocchi will dissolve.
Make your sauce even more special by adding desalted capers or olives!
