In the beautiful region of Emilia-Romagna , the ciambella romagnola is a beloved treat, especially during Christmas when the air is filled with the aroma of freshly baked goods. Known as brazadela in Ferrara, this cake is a really good part of the holiday tradition. It’s like a ring-shaped cake without the hole. Really delicious. And its crispy exterior paired with a slightly tender crumb makes it a classic. Locals believe the secret to its perfect texture lies in mixing the dough by hand—a practice passed down through generations. This hands-on method isn’t just tradition—it’s what gives the cake that perfect moist yet crumbly texture that everyone loves. Pretty much. It’s simple and down-to-earth, but it carries a special charm, evoking memories of festive tables and family tales.
Enjoying a slice of the brazadela recipe is more than just indulging in a sweet bite; it’s a taste of history. In Emilia-Romagna, it's common to dunk a piece into wine, a method known as “tociato,” which really enhances the flavor. So, so good. Each bite becomes more sweet and soft. Unlike cakes that are overly fluffy or heavily frosted, this Romagna dessert is a really really nice cross between an Italian sweet bread and a rustic cookie. Fits perfectly at breakfast, after dinner, or as a snack when friends pop by. And listen, many families have their own variations, perhaps adding lemon zest or a sugar dusting for a golden touch. This homemade flair distinguishes this traditional Italian cake —making it a true homemade Italian dessert that lingers in your memory. In Romagna, they say you can taste the love in every slice, and even if you’re far away, one bite brings warmth and nostalgia straight from an Italian kitchen. And here's the thing—it’s a cake that makes you want to sit, savor, and enjoy the easy joys of life, tenderly connecting you with the heart of Italy.
To make the Romagna ring cake, first melt the butter in a bain-marie and let it cool; once cool, add it to the eggs and lightly whisk to combine . In another bowl, pour in the sifted flour , sugar ,
salt , and sifted baking powder . Flavor with lemon zest, taking care to grate only the yellow part and not the white part, which would be bitter .
At this point, pour the egg and melted butter mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix with a spatula to gather the ingredients . Then transfer the mixture to the work surface and continue kneading by hand .
Once you have obtained a homogeneous and compact dough, shape it into a loaf , place it on a baking tray , and press it slightly with your palms to flatten it. Then brush the surface with milk .
Garnish with sugar granules and granulated sugar . Bake the Romagna ring cake in a fan oven at 340°F for 40 minutes, taking care to rotate the baking tray after the first 20 minutes to ensure even cooking. Once ready, take the Romagna ring cake out of the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.
The Romagna ring cake keeps in a tin box for about 2 weeks. If you wish, you can freeze the brazadela after baking, possibly already sliced.
It is possible to flavor the Romagna ring cake with a liqueur of your choice.
