To prepare the honey and poppy seed cookies, place the granulated sugar and room temperature butter cut into chunks in a large bowl . Mix with an electric mixer and then add the whole room temperature egg .
When the egg is incorporated into the dough, pour in the honey , continuing with the beaters to mix all the ingredients well. In a separate bowl, sift the flour together with the cornstarch and the baking powder .
Gradually add the sifted powders to the sugar and butter mixture and mix to obtain a light and fluffy dough; add the poppy seeds and the grated lemon zest .
Gather the ingredients with a dough scraper and then continue working the dough quickly by hand. Transfer it onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until you obtain a smooth and compact dough. At this point, form a dough ball, cover it with plastic wrap , and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
After the necessary time has passed, place the dough on a floured work surface; sprinkle it with a bit of flour to prevent it from sticking, and use a rolling pin to roll it out to a thickness of about 1/4 inch .
Take a cookie cutter with a diameter of about 2 3/4 inches and cut out disks : with our quantities, you should get about 30 cookies. With a 1 3/4 inch cookie cutter, cut out the center of each disk to create smaller circles . Gently remove the inner disks with your hands and re-knead them to form a dough ball; cover again with plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes, then repeat the operation until the dough is finished.
Place the cookies you have obtained on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 13-15 minutes (or 320°F for 8-10 minutes if using a fan-assisted oven). Once they are nicely golden , take them out and let them cool on a wire rack. At this point, you can serve and enjoy your honey and poppy seed cookies .
Store the honey and poppy seed cookies in a tin box for up to 1 week. You can freeze the dough before baking it and keep it for up to 1 month.
Let your imagination run wild! Make these cookies using different shapes and scent them in many ways, for example, with orange zest, vanilla, or cinnamon: they will be delicious!
