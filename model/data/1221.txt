instructions:
To prepare the pumpkin parmigiana, start with the tomato sauce. In a saucepan, heat a drizzle of oil along with a garlic clove. As soon as the base is warm, pour in the tomato puree , adjust the salt, add some basil leaves , and cover with the lid, letting it simmer gently for at least half an hour .
At the end of cooking, the sauce will be thickened . Meanwhile, take care of the pumpkin. After peeling it , cut it into slices no thicker than 0.4 inches .
Then dip the slices in flour, shaking off the excess and, little by little, fry in a pan with plenty of hot peanut oil . Let them turn golden, ensuring the slices do not burn, then drain on absorbent paper .
When all the slices are ready, proceed to the assembly. In a baking dish, pour a spoonful of sauce at the bottom , arrange the fried pumpkin slices to create the first layer on which to pour a bit of sauce
then grated Parmesan and basil . Continue like this until the last layer on which you'll only pour the remaining Parmesan . At this point, your pumpkin parmigiana is ready to bake in a preheated static oven at 400°F for about 25 minutes. After, place it under the grill for a few minutes. Let it cool slightly before serving your pumpkin parmigiana .
Pumpkin parmigiana can be stored in the refrigerator, well covered, for 3-4 days. Freezing is not recommended as the pumpkin may release water once defrosted.
