To prepare the trio of bruschettas, start with the bread: place the loaf on a cutting board and slice it into pieces about 1 inch (2-3 cm) thick . Then lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking tray, place the bread slices on it, and oil them, using a brush to coat the oil evenly . At this point, bake in a static preheated oven at 430°F (220°C) for 5 minutes, then switch to the grill and bake for another 2 minutes (if using a fan oven, bake at 390°F (200°C) for 5 minutes and then switch to the grill for another 2 minutes). When the bread slices are golden brown and slightly toasted, they will be ready to be topped .
To prepare the bruschettas with eggplant, burrata, and cherry tomatoes, start by washing the eggplant and trimming it. Then cut it into slices about 0.4 inches (1 cm) thick , transfer the slices to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, salt them , and drizzle a bit of extra virgin olive oil on each . Now bake in a static preheated oven at 390°F (200°C) for 10 minutes, then switch to the grill and cook for another 2 minutes. If using a fan oven, cook at 355°F (180°C) for 5 minutes, then switch to the grill and continue cooking for 2 minutes.
When the eggplant slices have softened and are nicely golden , transfer them to a bowl and season with mint leaves . Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest for about 5 minutes at room temperature so they soften further with their own steam .
Now caramelize the cherry tomatoes. Carefully wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them in half. Then, take a non-stick pan, add a drizzle of oil and the halved cherry tomatoes . Add the brown sugar and thyme and cook for 5 minutes over medium heat until the cherry tomatoes are slightly wilted and have lost some of their liquid.
Now, top the toasted bread slices. Arrange the bread slices on a cutting board and add a layer of eggplant , then place a piece of burrata and add the cherry tomatoes . Your bruschettas with eggplant, burrata, and cherry tomatoes are ready to be enjoyed!
To prepare the bruschettas with onion and sausage, start by crumbling the sausage: make a cut in the sausage casing with the tip of a sharp knife and remove the skin . After forming small sausage balls , take the white onion and slice it .
Heat a drizzle of oil in a non-stick pan and then add the sliced onion . When the onion begins to brown, add half a glass of water and finally the balsamic vinegar , and cook for 5 minutes over low heat.
Once the onion has softened and colored, add the sausage balls , cover the pan with a lid , and cook for another 5 minutes. Then transfer the sausage balls and onion onto the toasted bread slices, drizzling with the balsamic sauce that formed during cooking . Your bruschettas with onion and sausage are ready to be served and enjoyed while still hot!
To prepare the bruschettas with shrimp and zucchini pesto, start by cleaning the shrimp: remove the heads and peel them . Then pour a drizzle of oil into a non-stick pan, add the peeled shrimp , and cook for 5 minutes. In this recipe, defrosted shrimp were used, but you can also use fresh shrimp, cooking them until they turn pink. To learn how to best clean fresh shrimp, check out the Cooking School: How to clean shrimp . If you're using already peeled shrimp, you'll need about 3.5 oz (100 g).
Salt to taste and then add the paprika , stir and let simmer for a few more seconds until the shrimp are colored .
Now prepare the zucchini pesto: wash the zucchini thoroughly and trim it, then cut it into fairly thick slices and place it in a blender. Add the peeled almonds , some basil leaves , and pour in a drizzle of oil .
Turn on the blender until you get a thick and creamy mixture , which you will spread on the toasted bread slices . Add the shrimp and your bruschettas with shrimp and zucchini pesto are ready to be served!
It is recommended to consume the trio of bruschettas immediately. The zucchini pesto can be stored in the fridge in an airtight container or well covered with plastic wrap for 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Bruschetta is a humble dish originating from Tuscany, where it is also called fett'unta or panunta. Often, bruschettas were the entire dinner for farmers, who used stale bread, dressing it with simple ingredients they had on hand: oil, garlic, and ripe tomatoes. Over time, this dish spread to other regions such as Piedmont, Calabria, and Puglia.
The variations for this appetizer are endless: zucchini can replace eggplant, cherry tomatoes can take the place of cherry tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella instead of burrata. Again: goodbye onion, welcome bell peppers; no sausage, just chicken bites. Open the fridge and choose: which combination do we like best?
