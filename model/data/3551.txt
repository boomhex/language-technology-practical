To make the pasta and borlotti bean soup, soak the borlotti beans in plenty of cold water for at least 8 hours . Prepare the vegetable broth and set it aside (for more details on how to prepare the broth Vegetable broth ), then clean and wash the vegetables, then finely dice the potatoes , the carrot ,
the celery and the onion. Finely chop the guanciale (or lard) and brown a clove of crushed garlic with extra virgin olive oil.
Add the guanciale and, when it is almost melted, add the mixture for the sauté , the potatoes, and cook everything over high heat for 5 minutes, stirring often so it doesn't burn .
After the soaking time, drain the beans well and add them to the pan, lowering the heat , add the herbs (rosemary and bay leaf) , adjust the salt
and add the vegetable broth , then bring to a boil. Cover everything with a lid and cook for about an hour and a half, checking the beans from time to time, which should be tender but not mushy (if they dry out too much, add more broth or hot water). When the beans are tender, add the pasta and cook for the time indicated on the package, stirring often to prevent it from sticking to the bottom. The pasta and borlotti bean soup is ready: serve it very hot, with a drizzle of raw extra virgin olive oil.
Store the pasta and borlotti bean soup in an airtight container, placed in the refrigerator, for a maximum of 1-2 days.
The consistency should be like a soup, not too brothy but not too dry either; for this reason, it's good to adjust the amount of liquid to add as you cook, keeping in mind that both the potatoes and pasta have a starchy component that is released during cooking and tends to bind with the liquid and therefore thicken.
