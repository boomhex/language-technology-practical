instructions:
To prepare the stewed lamb, first clean and cut the celery, carrot, and onion into cubes of about 1/2 inch (1 cm) . Chop the spices with a knife and tie the aromatic herbs (sage, thyme, bay leaf, and rosemary) with string .
In a large pot with high sides, heat a drizzle of oil and sauté the vegetables adding a clove of garlic, crushed but unpeeled . Add the chopped spices to the sauté .
After a few minutes, add the desalted capers and continue over low heat for a few more minutes. Also add the bouquet of herbs . Finally, pour in the tomato paste , stir for a few minutes, and set aside; this will be the base for the stew cooking.
Salt the lamb , pour a drizzle of oil in a pan , place the lamb and brown it well on all sides over high heat .
When it has a nice toasted color, transfer the pieces of lamb to the pot with the vegetables . Remove the fat from the pan where you browned the meat and pour the red wine into the same pan , making sure to deglaze the pan well.
When the alcohol has evaporated and it has reduced by 1/3 , pour it into the pot with the meat . Return to heat and add the meat broth .
Continue cooking over very low heat, with a lid for one hour and then another good half hour without a lid, so that the liquid evaporates and the sauce thickens . At this point, the stewed lamb is ready, serve it hot .
The stewing method is well-suited for storage. It can be prepared up to two days in advance by storing it in the refrigerator and reheating it in a pot. Freezing is not recommended.
It is recommended to choose lamb cuts that hold up well to cooking, pieces with bones, legs, shoulders, etc. If you want an even sweeter taste instead of red wine, which accentuates acidity, you can use brandy or marsala.
