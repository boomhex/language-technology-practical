instructions:
To prepare the duchess potatoes with spinach, place the whole potatoes with their skins in salted cold water and cook them for about 30-35 minutes after boiling, checking the consistency with the tines of a fork. Meanwhile, clean and chop the onion . In a non-stick pan, pour a drizzle of oil and the chopped onion , then stew over low heat until the onion is soft.
Add the spinach and season with a pinch of salt . Cover with the lid and let them wilt.
When the spinach is cooked , transfer it to a sieve to let it dry, pressing slightly . Blend them with an immersion blender .
You should obtain a homogeneous puree . Then let it cool. Drain the cooked potatoes and pass them, still hot, through a potato ricer .
Add the butter , stirring immediately to let it melt. Season with grated nutmeg and salt, then add the spinach puree .
Finish with the egg yolk , chopped dill , and pepper .
Mix well with a spatula and transfer to a piping bag with a 0.5 inch star nozzle . Keep in the fridge while the oven heats up, the mixture should be cold when forming the dollops. Pipe your duchess potatoes well-spaced on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , a couple of batches will be needed.
Brush the surface with a little oil and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 18 minutes. Once baked, let them cool slightly before handling, as they are very delicate when hot . Meanwhile, prepare the cream: in a bowl pour the fresh cream and spreadable cheese .
Season with oil , salt, and pepper . Mix vigorously with a whisk .
You should obtain a creamy consistency . Spread the cheese cream on a serving plate , then place the green duchess potatoes on top .
Garnish with sprigs of dill , pomegranate seeds , and pepper to taste. The duchess potatoes with spinach are ready to be served !
The duchess potatoes with spinach can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days, in an airtight container. The dough can be prepared the day before and kept in the fridge.

If you cook more spinach, the leftover puree is an excellent condiment for spaghetti or risotto, to be creamed with a good knob of butter!
