Sardinian fregola with seafood—seriously—captures the heart of the island’s beautiful coast and its unique pasta traditions. You know, these little toasted semolina pearls, known as fregola , develop a tender bite when cooked slowly like risotto. The flavors? They really soak in. What makes this dish stand out is the super fresh seafood like clams, mussels, razor clams, and sometimes even sea almonds. It's a rich, salty vibe, just like the sea.
And then there's samphire—also known as sea asparagus—which adds a crisp, wild taste unlike anything else. A splash of asparagus emulsion brings a modern touch. Each bite, honestly, offers a really good blend of ocean brine and earthy greens. This shows how Sardinian cuisine honors its roots while staying creative.
While some might compare this fregola seafood recipe to other Italian seafood pasta recipes , Sardinians take pride in their distinctive version. And fregola with seafood becomes glossy and moist from being cooked risotto-style. It ensures the dish doesn’t dry out or get overwhelmed by the sauce. Really, each little ball of fregola soaks up the seafood juices and that briny samphire heart, giving it a more creamy vibe than your typical spaghetti with seafood.
Across Sardinia, local variations might feature different shellfish or a hint of wild fennel. But you know what? The core idea remains—fresh, local, and just a touch creative. Fans of traditional Italian pasta dishes will find something new here, with that perfect blend of classic comfort and contemporary flair. This dish is a staple both at beachside shacks and chic spots in Cagliari, which is great, always celebrating the flavors that make Sardinia unique from the rest of Italy. It really stands out among seafood pasta variations , ideal for when you want to savor the sea and the land all in one bowl, making it a true culinary gem. Pretty much.

To prepare the fregola with seafood and samphire, heat a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil in a pan with a clove of garlic in its skin , then add the razor clams and clams .
Also add the dog cockles . Cover with a lid and wait for them to open over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally . Once they are all open, collect them in a bowl .
Shell the seafood and strain the cooking liquid through a sieve lined with a kitchen cloth to remove any sand residues and set it aside.
In a second pan, heat another drizzle of oil with the garlic in its skin , add the already cleaned mussels , cover with the lid and let them open over high heat.
Once they are open , transfer them to a bowl and shell them .
Again, strain the cooking liquid and add it to the cooking water of the other seafood. Now move on to the preparation of the samphire emulsion: blanch 50 g of samphire for 30 seconds in boiling water , drain it and cool it immediately in ice water .
Pour the samphire into the mixer glass , the dill, the fennel , and a tablespoon of the shellfish water .
Add a splash of ice water , then blend . Gradually pour in the seed oil while blending until you obtain a fluid and bright green sauce.
Now toast the fregola in a dry saucepan . When the grains are warm to the touch, begin cooking as if it were a risotto, pouring the filtered shellfish cooking liquid one ladle at a time alternating with hot water to balance the saltiness .
After about 6–7 minutes, add the 100 g of coarsely chopped samphire and cook the fregola, adding liquid as needed, for a total of 12–14 minutes (depending on size). When there's one minute left, incorporate 3–4 tablespoons of samphire emulsion and stir vigorously until the fregola's cooking time is finished. At this point, turn off the heat and add three-quarters of the seafood .
Flavor with grated lemon zest and a tablespoon of samphire emulsion . Stir gently to combine .
To plate, place the fregola in the center of the dish , garnish with the whole shellfish set aside , some sprigs of fresh dill or fennel, a grind of black pepper , a drizzle of raw oil, and a final sprinkle of lemon zest. Serve your fregola with seafood and samphire immediately !
We recommend consuming the fregola with seafood and samphire immediately.
For perfectly balanced fregola, add the seafood water little by little: it will help you adjust the saltiness without having to excessively salt.
If you bought seafood to clean, you can follow the cleaning instructions provided in the respective sheets on our website: How to clean clams , How to Clean and Open Mussels .
To clean razor clams, rinse them well under cold running water, then let them purge in salted water for 30–60 minutes, changing the water a couple of times. Rinse them again before cooking to remove any sand residue.
