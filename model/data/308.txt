instructions:
To prepare the crostini with creamed salt cod, first place the salt cod in a pot with cold water and bring it to a boil. Cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the salt cod is tender, skimming off any foam that forms on the surface . Meanwhile, slice the bread .
Cut the slices in half , place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, and drizzle with oil . Bake in a fan oven at 390°F .
Chop the parsley with a knife . Drain the salt cod and let it cool, then remove the skin .
Also remove the bones and break it into pieces with your hands. Transfer the salt cod to a stand mixer with a paddle attachment , turn it on, and gradually add the olive oil ; you should achieve a creamy consistency. If it turns out too dry, you can add some of the salt cod's cooking water a little at a time until you reach the desired consistency.
Season with salt and pepper . Form quenelles using 2 spoons and place them on the crostini .
Garnish with chopped parsley and grated lemon zest . Your crostini with creamed salt cod are ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the crostini with creamed salt cod as soon as they are ready.
The creamed salt cod can be stored in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for 1-2 days.
You can enrich the crostini with sliced black or green olives, confit cherry tomatoes, or caramelized onions.
If you don't have a stand mixer, you can use electric beaters or a blender.
