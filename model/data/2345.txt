To prepare the robiola-stuffed peaches with spicy cherry sauce, start by preparing the sauce. Wash the cherries, remove the pits and stems, and cut them in half . Also chop the fresh chili pepper and place it with all its seeds in a saucepan, along with the cherries .
Add the sugar , then squeeze the lemon and add the juice to the saucepan .
Stir, and let the sauce simmer gently for about 10 minutes . Blend the sauce with an immersion blender , and strain it through a sieve
and place it in the fridge to cool for at least a couple of hours . You can get ahead by preparing the sauce a few days in advance, storing it in the fridge in an airtight container. Then move on to the peaches: cut them in half along the seam and remove the pits .
In a small bowl, combine the oil and salt , dip a kitchen brush and brush the emulsion on the cut side of the peaches . Heat a grill pan, and when it's nice and hot, grill the peaches on the cut side for 3-4 minutes.
When the peaches are ready, set them aside . In a small bowl, place the robiola, well chilled from the fridge, and mash it slightly with a spoon to make it creamy. Use an ice cream scoop to take a ball of robiola and fill a peach half, which you will have placed on the dessert plate .
Take the cherry sauce, place it in a squeeze bottle to facilitate the operation, and drizzle about a quarter onto the plate . Finally, sprinkle with a quarter of the chopped pistachios and complete the dish with a whole cherry . Repeat the same procedure with the other portions: your stuffed peaches are ready to be enjoyed!
The stuffed peaches should be enjoyed immediately. You can store the grilled peaches, sealed in the fridge in an airtight container, for up to 1 day. The cherry sauce can be stored in the fridge, in an airtight jar, for one week.
