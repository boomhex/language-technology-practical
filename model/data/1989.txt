instructions:
To prepare penne with artichokes and tomato, first, tackle the cleaning of the artichokes: peel away the tough outer leaves of the artichoke , cut off the tip which is harder. Now remove the end of the stem , which is also the hardest part. Cut away any thorns present, then use a paring knife to remove the outer fibrous layer of the stem .
Cut the artichokes in half , remove the fuzzy choke inside, and slice them into strips about 1/2 inch thick . Now focus on the sauce: in a pan, heat olive oil and add the whole peeled garlic to infuse flavor .
Add the artichokes , season with salt , pepper, and let them sauté for 5 minutes. At this point, add the peeled tomatoes
and extend with water . Let the sauce with the artichokes cook for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. When the sauce is cooked, remove the garlic with kitchen tongs . As soon as the water starts boiling, add the penne and cook them al dente for the time indicated on the package.
Once cooked, drain the penne with a slotted spoon directly into the pan with the sauce . Let the pasta absorb the flavors for a couple of minutes, then turn off the heat and scent with fresh basil leaves and serve the penne with artichokes and tomato hot .
It is recommended to consume the penne with artichokes and tomato immediately; otherwise, you can store only the sauce in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for a couple of days.
As an alternative to peeled tomatoes, you can use tomato purée to season the pasta.
