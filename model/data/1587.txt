instructions:
To make gobeletti, start with the shortcrust pastry: in a bowl, pour the flour and cold butter in pieces . Crumble the mixture with your fingers and then add the sugar .
and the egg yolk . Continue kneading by hand until all the ingredients are combined , then transfer the dough to a work surface and form it into a dough ball.
Wrap the dough with plastic wrap . Place the dough in the fridge for about an hour. Take the dough, place it on a lightly floured surface, and roll it out with a rolling pin to about 0.2 inches thick . Using a scalloped cutter with a diameter of 3.5 inches, cut out 8 circles .
With another scalloped cutter with a diameter of 2.4 inches, cut out another 8 circles . Brush 8 aluminum tartlet molds with a diameter of 2.75 inches and line them internally with a 3.5-inch dough disk ;
press well on the edges and bottom to adhere the dough . Fill the pastries with one and a half teaspoons of jam and close them with the smaller circles .
Seal the edges well by applying slight pressure to ensure closure . Place the pastries on a baking tray and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 30 minutes in the middle rack. Once ready ,
let them cool slightly and then remove them from the molds by running a knife along the edge . Dust the surface of the gobeletti with powdered sugar before enjoying them (20-21)!
Store gobeletti outside the refrigerator, in a tin box or covered with plastic wrap, for a maximum of 4 days. The shortcrust pastry can be frozen raw.
You can make the shortcrust pastry more aromatic by adding citrus zest or the seeds of a vanilla pod. For the filling, you can choose the jams you love the most!
