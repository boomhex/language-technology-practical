instructions:
Clams on zucchini velouté is a creamy, refined, and light first course: simple and not very labor-intensive to prepare, it can be served with toasted croutons, perhaps slightly rubbed with garlic, to make it more substantial.
To prepare clams on zucchini velouté, start by washing the potatoes, peeling them, and cutting them into fairly small cubes . In a pan, sauté the finely chopped shallot, add the potatoes , and pour in half a glass of wine. After 3-4 minutes, also add the sliced zucchini and cook them until they soften, pouring in the remaining wine.
Meanwhile, in another pan, heat the oil, the crushed garlic, and a few pieces of chili pepper; add the clams and let them open over high heat, then turn off the heat . Filter the clams' cooking liquid and add it to the potatoes and zucchini . Blend everything until you obtain a smooth cream. Separate the clams from their shells, leaving some aside for decoration. Serve in a bowl, adding the shelled clams and decorating with a drizzle of raw oil and some clams still in the shell.
You can also make the zucchini velouté with smaller clams: the tellines.
