People in Liguria have always embraced sharing traditional Italian bread —it’s a big part of coming together and enjoying simple, crispy bites with friends. Whether you’re trying out a new cheese-stuffed focaccia for a get-together or just want to impress with something different, this recipe shows the fun side of homemade bread. It’s all about soft, flavorful dough, playful shapes, and tasty surprises inside—exactly the kind of treat that gets everyone reaching for seconds. This dish brings together the heart of Ligurian culture, where food is about sharing and savoring every bite with those around you.
To prepare the stuffed pinched focaccia, start with the dough. In a stand mixer equipped with a dough hook, pour the sifted flour, dry yeast , and sugar , and start the mixer on low speed. Then add the milk and room temperature kefir milk in a thin stream .
While continuing to mix, also add the vegetable oil in a thin stream . Then add the room temperature egg , and when it is absorbed, add the salt .
Continue to knead for about another 5 minutes until the dough is well caught on the hook . Then transfer it to a floured work surface and work it with your hands to give it a spherical shape .
Place the dough in a large bowl and cover with clear plastic wrap . Let it rise for 4 hours in an off oven with the light on (at a temperature of 78-86°F maximum). Meanwhile, proceed with the preparation of the filling. Take the Emmental and Caciocavallo cheese and cut them into small cubes , repeating the operation with the cooked ham .
After the rising time, retrieve the dough that will have doubled in volume and transfer it onto a slightly floured work surface; with a rolling pin, roll it out until you obtain a sheet with a thickness of approximately 0.2 inches . Then cover the dough sheet with a clean cloth and let it rest for 10 minutes . This operation is necessary to prevent the dough from retracting when cutting immediately.
Create dough discs using a pastry cutter with a diameter of 3 inches . The leftover dough can be reused to obtain further discs. You can fill half of the obtained discs with ham and Emmental cubes and the other half with a teaspoon of 'nduja and Caciocavallo cubes , being careful to leave a border space to avoid the filling spilling out during cooking.
Take one disc and fold it in half to obtain a half-moon shape , then bring the ends of the half-moon to the center to give the shape of a small rose . Press the ends firmly with your fingers to seal the dough. Repeat the operation with all the discs. Then take a pan with a diameter of 12.5 inches and line it with parchment paper. Arrange the stuffed roses in the pan, starting from the edges and alternating the different fillings.
Then fill the entire mold up to the center, layering the roses in the center with a second layer if necessary . Lightly brush the entire stuffed pinched focaccia with a beaten egg and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 20 minutes (or in a convection oven at 356°F for 10 minutes). Remove your stuffed pinched focaccia from the oven, let it cool slightly to room temperature, and... enjoy it while still warm !
The stuffed pinched focaccia can be stored covered in a glass dome for a maximum of 2-3 days in the refrigerator. Before enjoying it, warm it up slightly.
It can be frozen once cooked if only fresh ingredients have been used. It can also be frozen raw. To finish cooking, defrost the focaccia at room temperature, brush it with egg, and cook as indicated.
The filling is the fun part of this focaccia: let your imagination run wild! Experiment with combinations of cheeses and cold cuts that you and your guests will enjoy the most!
The Kefir milk used in this recipe is a beverage derived from the fermentation of milk and is widely used in Eastern European regions, especially in Russia and the Caucasus.
Traditionally, it is prepared with fresh milk to which Kefir grains or cultures are added, which is where the name of this beverage comes from. The use of fermented milk has very ancient origins that are lost in time: similar beverages are also mentioned in Marco Polo's "The Travels of Marco Polo".
Kefir milk can be purchased in well-stocked grocery stores, stores selling ethnic foods, or organic food stores.
