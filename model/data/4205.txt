instructions:
The caipirinha is a beverage that symbolizes Brazil, loved for its lively freshness. The lime is the main ingredient: its wedges, cut and muddled, release the juice and essential oils, infusing the cocktail with an intense citrus note. The white cane sugar partially dissolves when muddled with the lime, creating a sweet and sour mixture. The cachaça, derived from the fermentation and distillation of sugarcane juice, has a unique aromatic profile that adds depth and complexity to the cocktail. This simple yet effective combination is what makes the caipirinha such a beloved cocktail and representative of Brazilian culture... the perfect choice to bring a touch of festivity and joy to any occasion!

To prepare the caipirinha, first, slice the lime and place it in an old-fashioned glass . Add the white cane sugar and, using a muddler, gently muddle the lime. Then add crushed ice to fill the glass .
Pour the cachaça , gently stir one last time , and your caipirinha is ready to be enjoyed !
The caipirinha must be consumed immediately upon preparation and cannot be stored.
Muddle the lime and sugar gently; the goal is to extract the juice and essential oils: over-muddling the peels risks releasing the bitter part, ruining the perfect balance of the cocktail.
