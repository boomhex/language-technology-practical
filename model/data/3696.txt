Do the same with the orange and add the citrus fruits to the bowl . Add the grapes ; if the grapes are too large, you can cut them in half.
Cut the strawberries into pieces and put them in the bowl . Add the cinnamon sticks and give it a stir.
Now pour the prosecco and stir one last time . Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it macerate in the fridge for at least 1 hour and up to 6-8 hours.
Once the maceration time has passed, put a ladle of sangria at the bottom of the glasses, add ice , and adjust with seltzer to taste . Your white sangria is ready to be served !
White sangria can be stored in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, for one day.
You can experiment with different types of fruit and liqueurs: for example, you can add tropical fruit like pineapple or mango for an exotic touch, or use lemon liqueur instead of orange for a twist. Some variations also use white wine instead of prosecco!
Taste the sangria during preparation and adjust the level of sweetness and acidity to your liking.
