instructions:
To make homemade panko, first remove the crust from the sandwich bread , then cut the crumb into chunks .
Transfer the bread into a mixer and blend : you should obtain coarse crumbs, not too fine .
Spread the bread crumbs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, making sure to distribute them evenly . Bake in a fan oven at 250°F for 5 minutes: after this time, the panko will be light and dry but still a little soft. Let it cool completely on the tray , after which your homemade panko is ready to use !
Once dried and cooled, homemade panko can be stored in an airtight container for up to 6 months in a cool, dry place.
If, after baking, you find that the bread pieces are too large, you can crumble the panko with your hands until you get crumbs of the desired size.
