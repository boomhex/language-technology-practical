instructions:
To prepare the fried mozzarella, first cut it into slices of 3/4 inch and then into cubes . Place it in a sieve to drain .
Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat the eggs with salt and pepper , then also add the milk .
Drain the mozzarella well, then coat each piece first in flour , then in the egg , and then in breadcrumbs .
Make a double coating only in the egg and breadcrumbs . In a saucepan, heat the seed oil, and when it reaches 340°F-356°F, dip the breaded mozzarella pieces a few at a time.
Fry for a couple of minutes . When they are golden, drain them on absorbent paper . The fried mozzarella is ready to be enjoyed.
We recommend consuming the fried mozzarella immediately. It cannot be frozen.
Instead of cutting the mozzarella into cubes, try using ready-made small mozzarella balls. To enjoy this tasty finger food, prepare small cones of parchment paper, the kind used for fried foods, fill each with 3-4 mozzarella balls, and decorate with rosemary sprigs; they will be perfect for your home aperitifs!
