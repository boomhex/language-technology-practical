With the recipe for seabass stuffed ravioli with arugula sauce, you will elevate your holiday menus to a gourmet level, making everything with your own hands! This first course, so refined and elegant, will be the highlight of the Christmas table, especially the perfect choice for Christmas Eve dinner. This culinary delight skillfully combines high-quality ingredients to create an unforgettable gastronomic experience. The seabass filling, a delicate-flavored fish, harmoniously blends with creamy ricotta, which gives a soft and velvety note to the dish. The touch of lemon adds a citrus freshness that perfectly balances the rich taste of the seabass ravioli, creating a symphony of delicious flavors. The arugula sauce, with its bright green color and slightly spicy aftertaste, adds a lively note that completes this delicious dish.
To prepare the seabass stuffed ravioli with arugula sauce, start with the fresh pasta: sift the flour into a bowl, pour the eggs into the center of the flour and start mixing first with a fork and then with your hands . Transfer the mixture to a work surface and knead vigorously until you get a smooth, homogeneous dough ball . Cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes, away from drafts.
In the meantime, proceed with the filling: take the seabass fillets and ensure there are no bones, removing them with tweezers if necessary. Sear the seabass fillets in a pan with garlic and oil on the skin side for a couple of minutes . Once colored, add salt, flip, and continue cooking on the other side over medium-high heat until cooked through . Remove the skin and, if desired, set aside some pieces of fillet to garnish the plates.
Chop the fish with a knife and place it in a mixer with ricotta , almonds , and oregano.
Flavor with grated lemon zest , salt, and pepper. Blend to obtain a smooth cream, then let it cool and transfer to a piping bag. Take the fresh pasta, divide it into two equal parts with a dough scraper and cover one part with plastic wrap so it doesn't dry out .
Work the other part of the dough by rolling it out with a pasta machine to a thickness of about 1/32 inch (up to number 8 on the machine). You will get a long sheet to be divided into two equal parts. Sprinkle the ravioli mold with flour, then take one of the two sheets (cover the other sheet with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out), roll it slightly with a rolling pin so that it has the same width as the mold, then lay it on the mold and gently press down to create the indentations . Fill the pasta with the filling , being careful not to overdo it to avoid them bursting during cooking.
Brush the edges with water to help the pasta adhere better, then cover with the second sheet and press with your fingers to seal . Finally, roll the rolling pin over the mold to further seal the two pasta sheets .
Gently remove the excess pasta, then flip the mold to release the ravioli and transfer them to a tray lined with parchment paper or a cloth dusted with flour . Prepare the sauce: in a mixer, combine cleaned arugula, almonds, oil, and salt .
Blend until you get a sauce . Cook the ravioli for about two minutes in boiling salted water , then drain them into a pan .
Add some cooking water and, off the heat, also add the sauce . Mix well and serve the seabass stuffed ravioli with arugula sauce, accompanied by the reserved fish fillets .
Once prepared, we recommend cooking the seabass stuffed ravioli immediately; alternatively, you can store the raw ravioli in the freezer for up to 1 month.
To freeze the ravioli, you can proceed as follows: place the tray with the ravioli in the freezer for a couple of hours or until they are hardened, then transfer them to food-safe freezer bags. When you want to use them, cook them in plenty of salted water while still frozen.
If you don't have a ravioli mold, you can make them by hand following the instructions found here: ricotta and spinach ravioli !
