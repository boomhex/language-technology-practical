instructions:
To prepare the pastries with sautéed Jerusalem artichokes, start by peeling and cleaning the Jerusalem artichoke, then cut it into slices and then into regular cubes . Chop the aromatic herbs very finely and set them aside . Put a drizzle of oil in the pan and add the Jerusalem artichoke cut into cubes. Let it cook for a couple of minutes, then salt and pepper to taste ;
add the chopped herbs to the pan and mix well to combine everything. Let it all cook over medium heat for 15 – 20 minutes until the Jerusalem artichoke has softened . Once the Jerusalem artichoke is cooked, place a teaspoon on each pastry , then finish with a grind of black pepper on each pastry.
We recommend consuming the pastries as soon as they are ready. If you want to prepare them in advance, once ready, store them in the fridge in an airtight container for a maximum of 2 days.
If you want to give your pastries a more pronounced flavor, crush a clove of garlic and sauté it for a few seconds in the oil before adding the Jerusalem artichoke cubes!
