instructions:
To prepare the whole wheat plumcake, start with the batter. Take the ricotta and place it in a bowl with the granulated sugar , begin to beat with a mixer until you obtain a smooth cream , then add the eggs one at a time .
Wait until they are well incorporated before adding the next one . With the mixer still running, gradually add the sunflower oil and the milk .
Also add the vanilla extract and the pinch of salt and continue mixing for about 1 minute. Sift in the baking powder to eliminate any lumps.
Continue working with the electric mixer and, while it's running, begin to gradually add the whole wheat flour . Mix for about a couple of minutes, until you obtain a homogeneous batter. Pour the batter into a 5.5x9 inch loaf pan lined with parchment paper .
Gently level the surface and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 45-50 minutes. When ready, remove from the oven and let cool. Then unmold it onto a serving plate and sprinkle with powdered sugar . Your whole wheat plumcake is ready to be enjoyed!
The whole wheat plumcake can be stored for several days under a glass dome. Alternatively, you can freeze it after baking, if you prefer already cut into slices.
For a more indulgent touch, you can add chocolate chips to the batter!
