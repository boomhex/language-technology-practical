Escarole fritters —I mean, who doesn't love them?—are these super tasty bites from Campania in Southern Italy. Known as frittelle di scarola, they're crispy, and truthfully, just plain good. The star here is escarole, which has this bold, bitter taste that really really pops. When you mix this tender green with salty capers and briny olives, it’s like a flavor explosion—seriously good. You’ll see these at buffets or family gatherings, and look, they make a killer Italian escarole fritters appetizer. They take a cue from scarola affogata, a popular Neapolitan way of prepping escarole. But here, everything's wrapped in a crunchy package that just works great.
Now, when you talk about the escarole frittelle recipe , it's kind of fun. You know, every family in Naples might put their own twist on it. Some toss in more olives, others up the capers, and hey, a few might even sneak in some chili for a tangy surprise. These fritters—one of those traditional Italian appetizers —pretty much shine at any party. People are into the crispy outside and the moist inside. For sure. They totally fit with other vegetarian Italian dishes , especially if you want easy recipes that don't take a ton of effort but still wow your guests.
Whether you’re making a big batch for a buffet or just a handful for yourself, homemade escarole fritters are a clever way to use up greens. And you know what? They’re amazing hot out of the fryer or even after they’ve cooled a bit—either way, the mix of tender greens and a crispy shell is unbeatable. So here's the thing: whether you're hosting or just craving something tasty, these fritters will definitely hit the spot. Bring the authentic taste of Campania right to your kitchen, and enjoy that touch of Italy with every bite. Can't go wrong.
To prepare the escarole fritters, clean, wash, and julienne the escarole lettuce , then slice the black olives into thin rounds . In a non-stick pan, brown 2 cloves of garlic with a little oil over low heat , and,
when it has turned golden, remove it and add the escarole . Cook it over medium heat for 15-20 minutes, or until all its water has evaporated: the escarole should become almost browned ; once cooked, turn off the heat and place it in a bowl along with the olives ,
the capers , and Parmesan cheese . Mix all the ingredients well and start preparing the batter: beat the eggs
together with the baking soda and flour, sifted together , then add the mixture to the escarole and mix well (11-12).
In a pan, heat the vegetable oil, and when it has reached a temperature of 356°F, start frying . If you don't have a kitchen thermometer, to check the oil temperature, take a teaspoon of batter and drop it into the oil: if it floats and starts to fry, the temperature is correct. Using a spoon, form balls of batter, which you will drop into the oil and cook for a maximum of two minutes. Drain the escarole fritters with a slotted spoon and place them on a tray covered with absorbent paper to remove excess oil, then let them cool slightly and serve.
We recommend consuming the escarole fritters immediately. We do not recommend freezing the escarole fritters.
Be careful not to let the oil for frying the escarole fritters get too hot, or else the fritters will cook only on the outside and remain raw inside. If you wish, to add more flavor to the fritters, you can cook the escarole with some smoked bacon. If you don't like garlic, you can omit it or replace it with finely chopped white onion. If you wish, you can bake the escarole fritters in the oven at 356-392°F until they are golden brown. To check the cooking, we recommend doing the toothpick test: pierce the fritters with a wooden toothpick and check that it comes out dry; if not, continue cooking.
