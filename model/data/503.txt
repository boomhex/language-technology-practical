instructions:
To prepare the rice omelette, first prepare the vegetables: shell the peas and gather about 80 g in a bowl, then do the same with the fava beans and remove the skin ; you will need about 50 g of shelled fava beans.
Remove the toughest part of the asparagus stalk and cut the rest into slices . Finally, clean the spring onion and slice it finely .
Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the rice for the time indicated on the package . Drain the rice and transfer it to a bowl, season with a drizzle of oil and mix well . Set aside.
Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan, add the spring onion and sauté over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add the asparagus and fava beans and sauté for another couple of minutes.
Add the peas , salt, and sauté everything for another 2 minutes, then pour in a splash of water , lower the heat, and cook covered for 5-7 minutes. Turn off the heat and let cool .
Crack the eggs into a bowl, then add the cream and grated Grana Padano DOP and mix well with a whisk .
When you have obtained a homogeneous mixture, add the rice , sautéed vegetables , and marjoram leaves .
Mix everything with a whisk , then salt and pepper. Take a deep pan (the one we used measures 19 cm in diameter at the base), heat a generous drizzle of oil, and pour the mixture inside .
Cover with the lid and cook over medium-low heat for about 35 minutes , then flip the omelette to the other side and continue cooking for another 6 minutes, still with the lid on . Transfer the rice omelette to a serving dish and serve !
The rice omelette can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, in an airtight container.
You can replace the Grana Padano DOP with grated Pecorino for a stronger flavor.
As an alternative to marjoram, you can use mint or oregano, fresh or dried.
Don't throw away the fava bean and pea shells, they are great for making other delicious recipes like Fava Pod Omelette or Pasta with pea pods !
