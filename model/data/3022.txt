Insalata di ceci gamberi e rucola is the kind of chickpea shrimp arugula salad that really hits the spot when the weather gets warm. Straight from Italian summer tables, this shrimp and chickpea salad blends flavors that just work together—tender shrimp, hearty chickpeas, and arugula with that little peppery kick. Really, it’s super tasty. There’s a fresh and almost tangy vibe thanks to a mix of extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and those toasted pine nuts tossed in at the end give the whole thing a crunchy edge. A little paprika in the sautéed shrimp makes things interesting and gives you a pop of color. The arugula stands out with its slightly spicy bite, balancing out the earthiness of the chickpeas—pretty much grounding the salad and making it filling enough to eat on its own.
In Italy, this type of healthy chickpea salad is a go-to when folks want something light but still satisfying. You know, you can enjoy it as a main meal or as a side when you’ve got fish or something else light on the table. Picture having this arugula and shrimp salad at lunch, dinner, or even as part of a picnic spread, since it travels pretty well and doesn’t get soggy right away. And the garlic? It makes the shrimp really, really juicy and moist after a quick toss in the pan.
Italian summer cooking is all about keeping things simple and letting the fresh stuff shine—this salad totally nails that. If you’re into more quick arugula salad dishes, there’s a similar one with tuna and beans that’s also pretty hearty and perfect for mixing up your summer routine. Also, another great addition could be pairing it with some crusty Italian bread. For sure, it gives you that authentic experience. Either way, this is one of those protein-packed meals that keeps you feeling good without slowing you down. It's the kind of dish that not only satisfies your taste buds but also makes you feel like you're enjoying a little piece of Italy right at home.
To prepare the chickpea, shrimp, and arugula salad, start by cleaning the shrimp (or prawns), remove the head , the shell , and the intestine using a wooden toothpick . For all the details of this procedure, consult our guide How to clean shrimp from the Cooking School.
Now toast the pine nuts: place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake them in a preheated static oven for about 10 minutes at 300°F (or in a convection oven at 265°F for 5-6 minutes) and set them aside. If you prefer, you can also toast them in a pan. Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan with garlic , add the prawns
salt , pepper, and finally add paprika. Cook them over high heat for 5-6 minutes (adjust the cooking time based on the size of the prawns; if they are very large, they will need a few more minutes). Once cooked, transfer them to a small bowl to cool.
Now drain the precooked chickpeas . We used precooked chickpeas, but you can also use dried ones, making sure to soak them for 12 hours; after the necessary time, drain the chickpeas, rinse them, and cook them in a pot for at least 3 hours or in a pressure cooker for one to one and a half hours, preferably over low heat. Once cooked, they will be ready to be added to the preparation. In the same pan used for the prawns, heat the chickpeas so that they absorb the flavor of the crustaceans). Now that all the ingredients are ready, you can assemble the salad: in a large bowl, put the washed and dried arugula .
Add the chickpeas , the prawns , and the toasted pine nuts .
Mix the salad . Finally, take care of the dressing: prepare an emulsion with oil , salt , and pepper.
Squeeze the juice of half a lemon , strain it , and add it to the emulsion ,
finish with a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar . Dress the salad with the prepared dressing . Your chickpea, shrimp, and arugula salad is now ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the shrimp, chickpea, and arugula salad immediately. It can be stored in the refrigerator for one day if not dressed.
Soft: check. Meaty: check. Salady: check. If you miss a crunchy note, fix it with corn or carrots cut into very thin julienne strips.
