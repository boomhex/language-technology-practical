To prepare the monstrous meatballs, prepare the vegetable broth needed for the meatballs and for cooking the potatoes, then start with the dough: in a bowl soak the bread crumbs in the milk , making sure it is completely absorbed. Meanwhile, in another bowl pour the ricotta, grated cheese , grated nutmeg; also add the lightly squeezed soaked bread and the egg.
Salt to taste and knead with your hands . If the dough is too soft, add 2 tablespoons of breadcrumbs. Slightly wet your hands to prevent the mixture from sticking and form 20 meatballs of about 20 grams each and set them aside. Continue the preparation starting with the potato cream: peel the potatoes, cut them into pieces
then cook them over medium heat in a large pan with the shallot , a drizzle of oil. Pour in the vegetable broth to cover them just barely to facilitate cooking (it will take about 40 minutes). Once ready, mash them with a food mill
and collect them in a small bowl . Then also prepare the tomato sauce by pouring the tomato puree into a pan with a drizzle of oil ; cook it for about 15 minutes over low heat and when it is ready, adjust the salt and add 3 leaves of fresh basil. Then bring the broth needed for cooking the meatballs to a boil and immerse a few at a time for a few minutes .
Then drain them and let them dry on a tray lined with absorbent paper. At this point, assemble your plates: pour the tomato sauce on each , place 3-4 meatballs and on each one position a slice of pitted green olive to simulate the eye .
Next to the meatballs, pour one or two teaspoons of potato cream (you can also use a piping bag to create a little cloud of potato cream), shaping them into ghosts and make the eyes with black sesame seeds. Here is your recipe for monstrous meatballs ready !
Store the monstrous meatballs in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. Separate preparations can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days in small bowls covered with plastic wrap.
If you want to save time, you can simply boil the potatoes or cook them in a pressure cooker. If you prefer a colorful version of the ghosts, you can divide the potato cream into small bowls and add spinach to one, and pureed pumpkin or beetroot to another!
