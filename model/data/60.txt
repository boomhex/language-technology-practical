instructions:
To prepare the water and flour gnocchi (without potatoes), start by combining the flour and a pinch of salt in a bowl . Add the water gradually , first mixing with a fork and then kneading with your hands .
Move the dough to the work surface and knead it until you get an elastic and homogeneous consistency ; if it's too soft, incorporate a bit more flour. Cover it with a bowl and let it rest for 5 minutes. Take the dough and work it with your hands to form a log .
Now, with a dough scraper, divide it into smaller portions . Form small logs about 0.5-1 inch thick . Then cut them into pieces about 0.75 inches .
At this point, you can mark each gnocchi with the tines of a fork or use a gnocchi board to get the typical ridged shape . The water and flour gnocchi are ready to be cooked !
If you don't cook the water and flour gnocchi immediately, place them on a tray with parchment paper and semolina. Let them dry in the air for about 30 minutes, then transfer them to the refrigerator, covering them with a cloth. You can store them this way for up to a day. Alternatively, after laying them on the tray, you can freeze them. Once frozen, you can transfer them to food bags and store them in the freezer for 2-3 months. In this case, we recommend cooking the gnocchi while still frozen.
To cook the gnocchi, drop them into abundant salted boiling water. When they float to the surface, they are cooked, which takes about 2-3 minutes.
