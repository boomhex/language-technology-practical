instructions:
To prepare the torn casatiello, first, add the fresh yeast to the room temperature water and stir to dissolve it . Pour the mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a hook .
Also, add the other fats: oil and lard . Start mixing the ingredients at low speed and gradually incorporate half of the flour using a spoon . Once the flour is absorbed and you have a sort of batter, add the salt .
At this point, add the remaining flour all at once and continue working at medium speed. The dough should have a soft consistency, but not overly so. It will take about 10 minutes of mixing with the stand mixer . Alternatively, you can work with the stand mixer for 5 minutes and the remaining 5 by hand on the work surface. Once the mixing is complete, stop the mixer and transfer the dough to the work surface just long enough to shape it into a ball; leave it to rest on the work surface while you prepare the filling, there will be no need to cover it.
Remove the skin from the salami and cut it into cubes . Use a knife to remove the rind from the pecorino and cut it into cubes of the same size as the salami .
Take the dough , take a small piece (about 80 g) , and set it aside: you will need it later to seal the eggs on the casatiello. Slightly flatten the dough .
Place the cubes of pecorino and salami in the center , and work it with your hands until all the ingredients are evenly incorporated .
Sprinkle generously with black pepper (preferably freshly ground) and knead until fully absorbed . Now shape the dough to form a loaf .
When it is long enough , place the loaf into a pre-buttered 9.5-inch diameter bundt pan , joining and sealing the two ends .
Now place the raw eggs vertically in 4 well-spaced points of the casatiello, pressing them lightly . Take the reserved dough and work 8 pieces to form small cords . Place the cords over the eggs to cage them and create a cross .
Once finished, cover the casatiello with a clean cloth and let it rise at room temperature away from drafts for about 1 hour to 1.5 hours. Once the volume has almost doubled , bake your Neapolitan casatiello in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 75 minutes, placing the pan at the bottom of the oven. Once cooked, let it cool slightly, then gently remove it from the mold and place it on a serving plate. Your torn casatiello is ready to be shared with the whole family !
The torn casatiello can be kept well-covered for 3-4 days at room temperature in a cool place but well-covered with plastic wrap or under a glass dome.
If desired, it can be frozen once cooked and completely cooled with the eggs included.
For the filling, you can choose to add other cured meats such as bacon or ham and other cheeses such as scamorza cheese. It's best to avoid fresh cheeses with a stretched texture like mozzarella.
