instructions:
To prepare the magic ricotta cake, first drain the sheep ricotta so it won't release liquid during baking. Pour the slightly beaten eggs into a large bowl , add the brown sugar .
Start working with a hand whisk . Add the orange zest and pour in the ricotta a little at a time with a spoon .
Now incorporate the cornstarch . Continue mixing with the whisk until you get a homogeneous mixture . Add the chocolate chips and mix with a spatula to combine.
Pour the mixture into a 8-inch diameter cake pan lined with parchment paper or greased and floured . Level the surface with a spatula . Bake in a static oven at 340°F for about 80 minutes. The magic ricotta cake will deflate a little once removed from the oven, but this is normal because it doesn't contain flour, only a little cornstarch. Once baking is complete, take the magic ricotta cake out of the oven and let it cool before removing it from the mold.
The magic ricotta cake keeps in the fridge for 2-3 days. We do not recommend freezing.
You can replace sheep ricotta with cow ricotta for a milder taste. Alternatively, you can use granulated sugar instead of brown sugar while keeping the same measurements.
