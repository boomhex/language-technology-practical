Potato frittata is an even richer version of the classic frittata and is a quick and nutritious dish par excellence! To make it more appetizing, we have added slices of potatoes that will enrich the dish with taste and add softness. This dish with simple flavors is perfect for the whole family thanks to its genuineness and heartiness. Excellent served hot, the potato frittata can also become an appetizer to be enjoyed cold in small squares and is also a practical idea for picnics!
To make the potato frittata , first finely chop the parsley with a knife . Then peel the potatoes and cut them into slices 2/5 inch (1 cm) thick . Bring a pot full of water to a boil and then blanch the sliced potatoes for 4-5 minutes .
Now pour the eggs into a bowl, add the grated cheese , chopped parsley then salt and pepper .
Mix the ingredients . Drain the potatoes that have finished cooking , let them cool and then add them to the egg mixture .
In a pan heat a drizzle of seed oil, and once it is hot, pour in the mixture . Cover with the lid and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes, turning the pan occasionally. When the surface is not very soft but still moist, carefully flip the frittata onto the lid by turning the pan with a firm and rapid movement .
Slide the frittata back into the pan so that the other side is also cooked, cover again with the lid and continue cooking for another 5 minutes. After this, the frittata will be ready , you can serve it hot or cold .
You can refrigerate the potato frittata in an airtight container for up to a day .
Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of blanching the potatoes, you can sauté them in a pan with a little oil to make the dish more appetizing.
