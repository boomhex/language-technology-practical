To prepare the potato muffins, start by boiling the potato in slightly salted water ; cook it until you can pierce it with the prongs of a fork (this will take about 30 minutes, but you can halve the time using a pressure cooker). Meanwhile, in a pan, heat a drizzle of oil and pour the diced smoked bacon ; let it render for a few minutes and season it with thyme leaves .
Once the potato is cooked, mash it while still hot with a potato masher (or let it cool slightly and peel it, then mash it with the prongs of a fork) and collect the pulp in a small bowl; add the rendered bacon cubes and the eggs . Mix the ingredients with a fork,
then add the milk and the grated Grana Padano cheese , after which sift the flour into the bowl
and carefully mix everything with a spatula . Salt, pepper to taste, and season with grated nutmeg . Finally, also add the baking powder for savory preparations .
Mix everything again with the spatula and transfer the obtained mixture into a piping bag. Line a muffin tray with colorful paper cases and fill them with the batter to the brim (so that they rise in the typical mushroom shape when baking). Bake them in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 20 minutes (320°F for about 15 minutes if using a convection oven). Once baked, take the potato muffins out of the oven and let them cool slightly before serving!
The potato muffins can be stored under a glass dome for 2-3 days. You can freeze and thaw them in the fridge when necessary if you have used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
Want to make these muffins even more delicious? Let your imagination run wild then: how about adding provolone cubes for a gooey center? Or you can replace smoked bacon with diced cooked ham or create a vegetarian version by replacing the cold cuts with cubes of sautéed zucchini or peppers!
