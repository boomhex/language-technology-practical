In a bowl, pour the all-purpose flour , add the buckwheat flour, then add the eggs, salt, and water: start by adding 1/3 cup and gradually the rest, because it might be necessary to add a bit less than indicated . Mix well with a whisk to obtain a smooth and homogeneous batter , which should be thick and detach from the spoon forming large drops (adjust accordingly with the water to add). Let the batter rest for 10 minutes in a cool place.
In the meantime, put a pot of water on the stove to boil for cooking the spatzle. Place the batter in the appropriate tool positioned over the pot of boiling water and release the spatzle, which will fall into the water below. (5-6)
Place the smoked bacon in a pan and fry it over low heat until it becomes golden and releases some of its fat: once golden, add the fresh cream, ground pepper , and then, as soon as the cream reaches a simmer, turn off the heat. As soon as the spatzle float to the surface, cook them for one more minute, then drain them and add them to the sauce in the pan , tossing them for a minute. Plate the spatzle and serve immediately.
