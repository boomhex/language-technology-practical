instructions:
To prepare the asparagus and shrimp velouté, wash the asparagus well and with a knife remove the lower part, the lighter one. Then, using a potato peeler, also remove the outer part at the base of the stalk . Cut the asparagus into 3/4-inch slices and set aside the whole tips . Transfer the asparagus scraps into a pot , add 500 g (2 cups) of water, heat everything and let it boil for about ten minutes, adding a pinch of salt.
Peel the potato and cut it into chunks about 3/4-inch in size . In a saucepan add the asparagus slices (but not the tips) and the potatoes .
Add a drizzle of oil , a pinch of salt and let it brown for a couple of minutes. Then add the broth made with the asparagus base, filtering it . Cover with a lid and let cook for 20 minutes over moderate heat.
In a non-stick pan, pour a drizzle of oil, add the asparagus, a pinch of salt and a few marjoram leaves . Add 2-3 tablespoons of water , cover with a lid and cook for 3 minutes. They should remain crunchy.
Clean the shrimp by removing the shell and the black vein . Wrap half a slice of bacon around each shrimp and prepare the others in the same way.
Cook the shrimp in a pan , turning them on all sides for a total of 3 minutes, until they are crunchy. Then pour the asparagus and potatoes into a mixer, add the sour cream and blend everything until you get a cream. If it should be too thick, add 1-2 tablespoons of warm water. Transfer the velouté into the plates, decorate with the asparagus tips and the shrimp . Add a sprinkle of pepper, a drizzle of raw oil, and sesame seeds.
The asparagus velouté keeps in the refrigerator for 1-2 days, closed in an airtight container. We recommend cooking the shrimp at the last moment.
Freezing is not recommended.
You can also use langoustines instead of shrimp. You can enrich the velouté with croutons flavored with a little garlic and aromatic herbs.
