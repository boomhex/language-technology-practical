To prepare rigatoni with porcini and berries, first start by gently washing the porcini mushrooms (for more details on cleaning porcini mushrooms click How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms ). Place the washed porcini mushrooms on a cutting board and slice them . Now take a non-stick pan, drizzle with a bit of oil, and brown a clove of garlic . When the garlic is golden, remove it from the heat .
Then add the previously washed and sliced porcini mushrooms to the pan and cook them over medium-high heat for 6 minutes. Then take the parsley, rinse it, place it on a cutting board, and finely chop it . Add the parsley to the mushrooms that are cooking . Adjust with salt and pepper. Use a wooden spoon to mix the ingredients well. Then turn off the heat.
At this point, take a pot and fill it with water. Heat it up, and when the water is boiling, add salt. Then pour in the rigatoni . While the rigatoni is cooking, rinse your mixed berries thoroughly in water . When the rigatoni is al dente, drain them using a slotted spoon, so as not to discard the pasta cooking water .
Pour the al dente rigatoni into the pan where you cooked the mushrooms and mix the ingredients to combine them uniformly . If the sauce is too dry, add a bit of pasta cooking water. A few minutes before removing the pan from the heat, add the berries , leaving some aside for decoration, and blend them into the pasta very gently so they remain as whole as possible. Then serve the rigatoni with porcini mushrooms and berries, decorating them with a handful of fresh berries, and enjoy the compliments of your guests !
Rigatoni with porcini and berries should be consumed immediately after cooking. They can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to one day. Freezing is not recommended.
