Spaghetti con pesto alla trapanese is a super tasty blend of Sicilian pesto pasta traditions with a unique twist from Northern Italy. Really. This flavorful dish hails from Trapani, a charming port town in western Sicily, where local chefs have transformed the classic Ligurian pesto into something super super special. And look, what sets this traditional Italian pasta recipe apart is the almond pesto sauce—locals swap out pine nuts for almonds, giving it a richer and slightly nutty flavor.
Juicy, fresh tomatoes are added to the mix, creating a sauce with a sweet and colorful kick that you won't find in the usual Genovese pesto. In Sicily, they often use busiate, a twisty pasta shape, but spaghetti works just as well. Which is great. It allows all that sauce to beautifully coat the noodles. This dish feels really summery—perfect for when you want something light yet full of bold taste.
And here's the thing: what makes spaghetti con pesto alla trapanese really be different is the use of Trapani almonds. These have a crunchy texture and mild flavor, resulting in a pesto that's both creamy and tender at the same time. Sicilians sometimes enhance the dish by adding grilled eggplant or confit cherry tomatoes, making it even more special. Imagine the soft, almost melty eggplant soaking up that bold almond and tomato basil pesto.
Using fresh basil, ripe tomatoes, and quality olive oil is essential if you want to capture the true authentic Sicilian cuisine vibe. You know, you can also experiment with different pasta types, like short shapes or even whole wheat, to create your own unique pesto variations. Thing is, that's the beauty of this recipe: it's traditional, yet there's plenty of room to play around and get creative. Whether you're a fan of the classics or eager to try something new, this Sicilian pesto pasta is a summer go-to that brings a touch of the Mediterranean right to your table. I mean, it's not just a meal; it's a little taste of Sicily's rich culinary heritage, perfect for enjoying with friends and family. For real.

In Sicilian dialect, this pesto is called “agghiata trapanisa” or garlic sauce from Trapani because the recipe includes red garlic, a type of garlic common in Sicily, characterized by having the tunics of the cloves of a purplish red color. Particularly famous is the Nubia garlic grown in the Trapani area.
