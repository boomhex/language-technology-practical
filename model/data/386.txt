instructions:
To prepare Ligurian style stuffed onions, first boil the potatoes in a pot starting from cold water for about 30-40 minutes from boiling . Meanwhile, cut the ends off the onions and remove the skin .
Blanch the whole onions for 5 minutes in salted boiling water, just enough time to soften them . Drain the onions and cut them in half , then gently peel them and set aside the larger layers .
The smaller onion layers and broken ones will be used for the filling, so put them in a mixer along with the mortadella and marjoram .
Blend and transfer the mixture to a bowl, then add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano DOP , salt, and pepper .
Also add the mashed potatoes and the eggs , then mix everything with a spoon .
You should obtain a homogeneous mixture . At this point, line a baking tray with parchment paper and place the onion layers inside , then fill them with the mixture using 2 spoons .
Sprinkle the surface with breadcrumbs and drizzle with some olive oil , then bake in a convection oven at 355°F for 25-30 minutes; if desired, you can turn on the grill during the last 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve your Ligurian style stuffed onions, hot or at room temperature !
Ligurian style stuffed onions can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container.
You can also enrich the filling with vegetables, such as zucchini or green beans.
