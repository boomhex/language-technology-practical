Caffè alla Salentina is a super cool take on Italian iced coffee that comes from the beautiful Salento area in Apulia. You know, instead of the usual cold brew or chilling coffee ahead of time, folks in Lecce came up with something different in the 1950s. And look, Antonio Quarta figured out that pouring hot coffee over fresh ice keeps the aroma and cuts down on any bitter or acidic notes, making every sip taste just right.
This Caffè alla Salentina recipe steps things up with almond milk for sweetness, which is a classic move here. But wait—it's not just any almond milk. You take fior di latte gelato, blend it with almond paste and milk, and let two scoops soak in a strong shot of espresso. That creamy, cold swirl mixed with the punch of hot coffee and some toasted almonds on top makes every glass special and a bit rich. Seriously good.
Throughout Southern Italy, this drink shows up on hot days, especially after big meals or when friends gather for a sweet treat. It's not just an iced espresso drink —it's a piece of regional tradition. For sure, it's become a favorite summer coffee beverage for those who love a little sweet in their coffee.
People really really love how the almond milk coffee twist adds a nutty touch and smoothness. So, it’s not just another plain coffee over ice. Plus, the toasted almonds sprinkled on top bring a little crunch and make it smell awesome. Which is great. Some folks compare it to other Italian cold coffee drinks, but this one stands out because of its Salento coffee roots and how it mixes dessert with coffee culture.
If you’re into trying regional Italian coffee drinks, this is a fun and tasty way to see what makes Apulia’s food scene unique. And here's the thing, it’s easy to see why this drink caught on and keeps showing up at family gatherings, cafés, and even at home. Really, you want to feel like you’re on vacation in Southern Italy. Every sip gives you a taste of Southern Italian tradition that’s refreshing and satisfying. Pretty much a must-try.
To prepare Salento-style coffee, place the almond paste and almond milk in a bowl and blend them with a whisk . Add the fior di latte ice cream and mix it with the other ingredients.
You should obtain a soft and homogeneous mixture which you will place in an airtight container and let it set in the freezer overnight (12 hours). Toast the almond slivers arranged on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper for 1 minute in a static oven at 392°F .
Once the ice cream is firm, prepare the coffee with the coffee maker. To obtain excellent coffee, fill the boiler of your coffee maker with cold water, preferably low in limescale, making sure not to exceed the safety valve (otherwise you will get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee, forming a mound that you will level by tapping the filter on the table with decisive movements (8-9). Do not press with a teaspoon or make holes on the surface.
Close the coffee maker very tightly , so that the coffee does not spill from the sides as it rises, and place it over a low and steady flame to obtain a full-bodied coffee. As the coffee rises, a thick foam will form : we recommend not letting it bubble for too long to maintain its sweetness and aroma. Your coffee is ready: before using it, stir it directly in the moka pot with a teaspoon to make the coffee more homogeneous .
Form two scoops of almond-flavored fior di latte ice cream and place them in a medium glass. Pour 1 oz of coffee into the glass and garnish with toasted almond slivers . Here's your Salento-style coffee!
Consume the Salento-style coffee immediately.
If you have leftover ice cream, you can serve it on other occasions.
