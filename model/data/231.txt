To make vanilla kipferl, pour the sugar into a mixer , add the almonds , and blend to a powder .
Transfer the mixture to a bowl, then add the vanilla bean seeds , all-purpose flour , and cold cubed butter .
Quickly work the ingredients first in the bowl and then on the work surface until you get a homogeneous dough. Form a dough ball , wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest in the refrigerator for an hour.
After this time, divide the dough into pieces weighing about 0.35 oz each , form a small roll and bend it into a crescent shape . Place the cookies on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for at least an hour .
After the chilling time, bake in a preheated static oven at 330°F for about 16 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack , then dust with plenty of powdered sugar . Your vanilla kipferl are ready to be enjoyed !
Vanilla kipferl can be stored for about a week in a tin box.
If you prefer, you can make the kipferl with blanched almonds.
