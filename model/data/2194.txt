instructions:
To prepare fregola with Romanesco broccoli, first start making the vegetable broth; once it's ready, keep it warm and focus on cleaning the broccoli. First, remove the outer leaves and then use a knife to separate the florets , cutting the larger ones in half ; you should obtain about 11 oz.
At this point, finely chop the shallot and transfer it to a pot where you have already slightly heated the oil . Let it sauté for about 5 minutes and in the meantime, separate the thyme leaves
and finely chop them . Add the broccoli to the pot , add the chopped thyme
and mix everything . Wait about 2 minutes and then add the fregola , then mix and also add a bit of hot broth .
Continue to cook the fregola for 25-30 minutes (following the timing indicated on the package) stirring often and adding more hot broth only if needed. Once cooked, turn off the heat and add the Parmesan cheese , stir again and serve your fregola with Romanesco broccoli hot .
Fregola with Romanesco broccoli can be stored for 1-2 days in the refrigerator. Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer, you can cook fregola and broccoli separately, then blend some of the latter and combine everything only at the end!
