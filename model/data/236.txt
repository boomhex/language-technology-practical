instructions:
To prepare the baked scampi, first cut the cherry tomatoes in half , transfer them to a baking dish, and season with lemon thyme and garlic .
Continue with salt, pepper , and oil . Bake in a fan oven at 392°F for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, thoroughly wash the scampi under running water, then make an incision starting from the tail up to the head . Butterfly the crustaceans and remove the intestines.
Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with oil and bake when there are 3 to 5 minutes left for the tomatoes to finish cooking. The larger the scampi, the longer they will need to cook.
Remove both the scampi and the cherry tomatoes from the oven. Plate them by placing the cherry tomatoes at the bottom of the plate, then arrange the scampi on top .
Add some of the liquid released by the cherry tomatoes during cooking and finish with a sprinkle of lemon zest . Your baked scampi are ready to be served !
Baked scampi should be consumed as soon as they are ready, but if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for up to 1 day.
If you love intense flavors, you can add Taggiasca olives and capers to the cherry tomatoes for a more Mediterranean taste. If you want to turn baked scampi into a main course, you can use the cherry tomatoes and cooking juices to dress long pasta, like linguine or spaghetti, to be completed with the freshly baked scampi. A real delight!
