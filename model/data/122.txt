instructions:
To prepare the spinach burgers, first peel and finely chop the onion . Then wash the spinach, drain it, and chop it coarsely . Peel the potatoes and grate them raw .
In a pan, pour two tablespoons of oil, add the chopped onion , and let it soften over low heat for about 5 minutes. Then add the potatoes and spinach .
Cook for about 5-6 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally and adjusting with salt and pepper . When the mixture is soft and dry, turn off the heat and let it cool slightly.
Meanwhile, blend the cooked chickpeas until you get a coarse cream. Transfer the chickpea puree to a large bowl and add breadcrumbs and nutmeg .
Add the turmeric and 2 tablespoons of oil . Then add the spinach and potato mixture .
Knead with your hands until you get a soft and moldable mixture . Form 4 burgers of about 6 oz each and place them on a tray lined with parchment paper. Press them lightly with your hands .
Cook the burgers in a lightly greased non-stick pan for 10 minutes, flipping them halfway through cooking so they are well browned on both sides. Serve your spinach burgers immediately .
Cooked spinach burgers can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days well covered. Alternatively, they can be frozen raw.
The burgers can also be baked in the oven at 400°F for about 15-20 minutes.
