instructions:
The decadent caprese is like a culinary dream from the beautiful island of Capri. You know, where the Mediterranean air is filled with stories and sea salt. Traditionally, a caprese salad recipe features tomatoes, mozzarella and basil lined up in simple elegance. And but this version—oh boy—steps into the realm of the dramatic and artistic.
It starts with a creamy burrata base instead of the usual mozzarella. And here's the thing, it’s topped with tomatoes crusted in poppy seeds. But these aren’t just any tomatoes. They’re paired with black basil leaves and sprinkled with black Cypriot salt, giving each bite a tangy twist and a hint of something moist and mysterious. Really, it’s so so unique.
This gourmet caprese salad embraces deep, tender flavors. It's almost like a poetic nod to fin de siècle Paris, all while staying true to its Italian roots. And the black rice pastry underneath? Super crispy. It is a secret delight waiting at the bottom of every forkful. In Capri, back in the 1920s, this dish first appeared as a simple, patriotic symbol. Today, with its layers and contrasts, the decadent caprese rewrites the rules—blending art and a touch of rebellion.
For those who love caprese salad variations , it’s a nod to the Futurist movement. Sharpness reigned back then, but here, it’s all about slow, lush indulgence. Imagine the aroma of black basil and the sight of poppy seeds clinging to juicy tomatoes, with the golden crust of rice pastry holding it all together. Pretty much perfect.
Each bite feels sweet yet edgy, thanks to the salt flakes and burrata. Honestly, this dish is perfect for sharing at the start of a meal, especially if you enjoy discussing art, history, or what makes Italian cuisine special. It shows that a caprese salad with burrata isn’t just an appetizer—it’s an experience. A reminder of how a classic can keep on surprising. Whether enjoyed with friends or during a quiet moment of reflection, this dish captures the heart of Italian innovation and the charm of Capri. Really really amazing.
To prepare the decadent caprese, start with the black rice sheet dough. In a bowl, combine the white flour with the Artemide or Venere rice flour and mix them together . Then add the salt and 1 tsp of oil
And finally the water , and mix. As soon as the dough reaches a sufficient consistency, transfer it to a work surface lightly dusted with black rice flour and knead for 5-6 minutes creating folds. When the dough is firm and elastic, roll it out with a rolling pin to form a thin sheet as if preparing fresh pasta. To assist you in this operation, you can roll out the dough between two sheets of parchment paper, removing the top one only when the sheet is thin enough.
Using a pastry cutter about 3.75 inches in diameter, cut out 4 disks and remove the excess dough, which you can choose to re-knead and re-roll to obtain more sheets. Transfer the sheets to a baking tray lined with parchment paper. In a small bowl, place some extra virgin olive oil, dip a kitchen brush into it , and brush the surface of your sheets .
Bake them in a preheated convection oven at 350°F for 12-14 minutes, until they wave slightly . Then proceed with the cherry tomatoes: wash and dry them thoroughly . Prepare a batter by combining flour, water
And salt in a bowl and mix well . Then prepare 2 more bowls: one with a bit of flour, another with poppy seeds. Take each cherry tomato and first coat it in flour
Then, using a pair of tongs, dip it in the batter to coat it evenly and finally roll it in the poppy seeds , shaking the bowl to help create an even crust. Fry a few cherry tomatoes at a time in plenty of hot seed oil (do not exceed 338°F, you can measure with a kitchen thermometer) for about half a minute
Then drain them on absorbent paper and salt their surface . Now focus on composing the plates: place half a burrata on each plate, spreading it on the bottom with the back of a spoon . Gently lay a sheet on top
And then distribute around 4-6 fried cherry tomatoes , the black basil leaves , and finally sprinkle with a grind of black salt flakes . Your decadent caprese is ready to be served!
The decadent caprese should be consumed immediately. You can store the black rice sheets in a tightly closed tin for 2 days before they lose their fragrance.
