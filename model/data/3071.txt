It's tied to weddings where it’s a sweet treat for celebrating joy and new beginnings. The name, meaning "the temptation of the wife" in dialect, adds a fun mystery. Often called an Italian wedding cake or traditional Italian dessert , there isn’t one fixed recipe. Pretty simple, right? Every family in Valle Camonica and Alta Valle Trompia has their own version, which is great. Keeps things interesting.
The dish? It's tender and moist, leaving quite the impression. The stories behind it make every bite feel special. Folks here love sharing meaningful stuff, especially during weddings. And the sauce? Nah, just kidding. While many outside Northern Italy might not know about tentasiù de la spusa , locals cherish it. It's this sweet reminder of how Italian wedding traditions unite communities.
Instead of fancy Italian wedding cake ingredients or layers of Italian wedding cake frosting , it’s simple. Really, it reflects what was in old farm kitchens. Not about looks—more about comfort and rustic crispy goodness. Super tasty. Sometimes, people add nuts or dried fruit, making each batch unique, kinda like Italian wedding cake variations from town to town.
It's a dish passed down generations, always evolving but keeping that golden celebration feel. Rediscovering this piece of Italian wedding cake history is a chance to taste a genuine slice of Lombardy’s past. And honestly, it’s just a really, really tasty way to connect with those old-school party vibes. Seriously good.
To make the tentasiù de la spusa, first prepare the dough: melt the butter in a bain-marie or microwave and let it cool. In a large bowl, mix the sifted flour and salt , add the melted butter and mix with a fork. Gradually add the water at room temperature and knead until all the ingredients are gathered together. If the dough is too dry, add more water; if too liquid, add more flour. (Alternatively, you can prepare the dough by placing the flour and cold butter pieces in a mixer to obtain a sandy mixture and then continue kneading by hand, incorporating the water).
The dough will be ready when it detaches from the sides and your hands . Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Now prepare the garnish: coarsely chop, preferably with a knife, the pine nuts ,
the walnuts , and raisins , place the dried fruit in a bowl and set aside .
Prepare the honey glaze: melt 1 oz of butter in a bain-marie , when melted, add the honey and finally the previously chopped dried fruit mixture . Leave everything on the heat in a bain-marie, so the mixture remains liquid and doesn't thicken.
Take the dough, place it on a sheet of parchment paper and cover it with another sheet of parchment paper , so it doesn't stick to the work surface and there's no need to add flour to the dough. Roll out the dough with a rolling pin ,
creating a round and quite thin sheet, about 1/16 inch . Cut the sheet in half with a smooth pastry cutter and cut strips of dough 3/8 inch wide and 4 inches long . Starting from one corner of the strips, roll them up to create compact spirals (or twists) but with a diameter not too small (if the dough becomes too soft to work with, you can refrigerate the dough strips before shaping them into spirals).
To maintain the curl during cooking, roll the spirals tightly . Place a pan with a high bottom on the heat with the seed oil, check with a kitchen thermometer that the oil temperature reaches 338°F, and immerse the tentasiù in the pan using a slotted spoon to preserve the spirals' shape . Fry the tentasiù a few at a time , the temperature must never exceed 338°F, or they will burn; conversely, if the temperature falls below 338°F, they will be too dry. (If you want, you can also use a fryer or alternatively bake the tentasiù de la spusa in a static oven at 392°F for about 15 minutes or convection oven at 356°F for 10 minutes).
The tentasiù will be ready when they are nicely golden , it will take a couple of minutes. Drain them on a tray covered with absorbent paper, then place them on a serving plate, and using a teaspoon, drizzle them with the honey and dried fruit mixture you have kept warm , finally dust them with powdered sugar . Enjoy the tentasiù de la spusa warm to prevent them from absorbing the moisture from the honey, making them too rubbery.
Consume the tentasiù de la spusa immediately while they are still warm. As a fried dessert, it can also be consumed the next day, but the result will be different. You can freeze the raw dough and defrost it the day before in the refrigerator.
Fundamental rules to keep the tentasiù de la spusa in shape! The first: equip yourself with a kitchen thermometer to ensure the oil's temperature is exactly 338°F (if possible, don't cheat: slightly higher or slightly lower are not valid alternatives...). The second: the dough must be cold, so if it becomes too soft, immediately put it back in the refrigerator and take it out only when it has firmed up!
