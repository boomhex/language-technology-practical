instructions:
To prepare the gluten-free mini pizzas, start with the dough: pour the flour mix and the extra virgin olive oil into a bowl , then add the salt and the instant yeast .
Finally, incorporate the Greek yogurt . Mix with a fork to combine the ingredients , then transfer the dough onto the work surface and start kneading it with your hands .
You need to obtain a smooth and firm dough . The dough is ready and can be worked immediately, no resting needed. Lightly dust the surface with some gluten-free flour and roll out the dough with a rolling pin until you get an even sheet about 1/8 inch (approximately 0.16 cm) thick .
With a round cookie cutter, about 2.75 inches (7 cm), cut out many discs and arrange them neatly on the surface . The dough scraps can be re-kneaded, yielding about 40 mini pizzas. Transfer the discs onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, well spaced apart, and brush the surface with extra virgin olive oil .
Season the mini pizzas with a teaspoon of tomato sauce in the center , add a pinch of oregano , and some mozzarella cubes .
Salt and bake in a preheated static oven at 410°F (210°C) for about 20 minutes, until the mini pizzas are golden and the mozzarella is well melted . Take them out and serve still hot, finishing with some fresh basil leaves .
The gluten-free mini pizzas can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
For a melty result, make sure to drain the mozzarella well and dry it thoroughly. Alternatively to cubes, you can slice it thinly or crumble it with your hands, depending on the result you want to achieve.
For an elastic and well-workable dough, choose a gluten-free flour mix specific for bread or pizza.
For gluten-free recipes, we recommend purchasing only products that have the crossed-out ear symbol on the package, certified gluten-free, recommended by the AIC Associazione Italiana Celiachia guide.
