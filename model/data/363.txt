instructions:
To prepare the blue crab risotto, first, clean the crabs very well, then cut them in half . Cook the whole crabs for 5 minutes in boiling water , then drain them .
Transfer the crabs to a bowl with ice water . At this point, remove the entrails, and with a spoon, extract the meat from the shell . Open the claws and extract the meat from them as well . Set aside both the shells and the meat.
Prepare the ingredients you will need for the broth and the cream, keeping them separate: peel the purple carrots and cut them first into strips and then into chunks .
Halve the cherry tomatoes , then cut the celery stalk and shallots into chunks.
Start with the broth: in a pot with a drizzle of oil, add the shallots and celery . Add the carrots , marjoram sprigs, and cherry tomatoes . Sauté for a few minutes.
Then add the crab shells and brown them for a few minutes over medium heat. Deglaze with rum and, when all the alcohol has evaporated, add the ice .
Cover with cold water , then season with salt and pepper . Cook for 30 minutes or until the liquid has reduced by half. Strain the broth and keep it warm.
Move on to the purple carrot cream: in a pot, pour a drizzle of oil, add the remaining shallot and sauté. Add the carrots , moisten with the crab broth , season with salt and pepper . Cook until the carrots have become tender.
Transfer everything to a blender and blend until you get a smooth and homogeneous cream .
Now you can start cooking the risotto: in a pot, put the rice, add a pinch of salt, and toast it dry for a few minutes. Moisten with the crab broth and cook the rice this way, adding a ladle at a time as soon as the liquid has been absorbed. When there are 2 minutes left until the end of cooking, add the purple carrot cream . Turn off the heat and stir in the crab meat .
Complete with grated citron zest , a drizzle of oil , and marjoram .
Plate and complete with more grated citron zest , a drizzle of oil and some marjoram leaves . The blue crab risotto is ready to be enjoyed !
If the blue crab risotto is left over, you can store it in a closed container for 2 days in the refrigerator. Freezing is not recommended.
If you do not have citron available, you can use lemon or orange zest.
If you like experimenting, you can enrich the risotto by adding other types of vegetables!
A pinch of saffron in the crab broth will add greater complexity to the dish.
