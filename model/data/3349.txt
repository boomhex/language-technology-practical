instructions:
To prepare the bell pepper flowers with eggs, start by washing the bell peppers well: choose peppers that do not have a straight and regular circumference but a “jagged” one , when cut into slices they should resemble the shape of a flower. Cut them into slices about 0.75 inches thick with a sharp knife and remove the central part of the slices .
Proceed in the same way with the red, yellow, and green peppers. Brush a non-stick pan with a little extra virgin olive oil and when it is hot, add the bell pepper rings , let them sear for a few seconds on one side, and then turn them over to the other side.
Crack an egg into a small bowl, being careful not to break the yolk, and then very gently pour it inside the bell pepper ring . Do the same with the other eggs. At this point, cover with a lid and let the eggs cook over medium heat, turning off the heat when the eggs have reached your desired level of doneness. Finally, salt and pepper to taste and, for a more precise result, remove any egg white that has spilled out from the edges of the bell peppers. Serve the bell pepper flowers with eggs immediately!
