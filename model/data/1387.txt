instructions:
To prepare the ferratelle, first, pour the sugar into a bowl , add the eggs , and the grated lemon zest .
Beat with an electric mixer for about 2-3 minutes . When you have achieved a frothy consistency, gradually add the oil . Then add the flour
and the baking powder . Work until the powders are completely absorbed to obtain a creamy consistency .
Heat the special griddle on the fire : we used one that is 6x4 inches. Brush both sides with melted butter and place a scant tablespoon of batter , about 1 oz, in the center.
Spread it a bit lengthwise , then close the two plates and use a spatula to remove any excess batter that has leaked out . Cook over low heat for about 50-60 seconds .
Flip the iron and cook for one minute on the other side as well . Remove from the heat and, without burning yourself, gently detach the wafer . Continue in this way until all the batter is used up. Let cool before serving your ferratelle !
You can store the ferratelle for 2 days at room temperature, sealed in an airtight container.
If you prefer, you can substitute the lemon zest with anise flavor!
