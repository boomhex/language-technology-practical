instructions:
To make the baked shrimp with pistachio crust, first prepare the breading: place the shelled pistachios in a food processor and blend to finely chop them, then add the breadcrumbs , parsley, sage, and rosemary .
Add salt and pepper as well and blend again to combine everything, then transfer the mixture to a bowl and set aside . Now take care of the shrimp: remove the head and shell, leaving only the tail attached .
Cut the back with the tip of a knife and remove the intestine . Rinse the cleaned shrimp under running water and pat them dry with paper towels .
Prepare the emulsion by mixing oil, the peeled garlic clove, rosemary, and salt in a small bowl. Dip one shrimp at a time into the emulsion, holding it by the tail , then cover it with the breading using a teaspoon . Place the breaded shrimp on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 428°F for 10 minutes, placing the baking sheet on the middle rack. After the cooking time has passed, remove from the oven and transfer the shrimp to the serving plate, then garnish with lemon slices and a few rosemary sprigs . Your baked shrimp with pistachio crust is ready to be served!
It is recommended to consume the baked shrimp with pistachio crust immediately. Alternatively, they can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
Do not throw away the heads and shells of the shrimp, but use them to make an excellent Shellfish Stock !
