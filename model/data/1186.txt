If you're craving a citrus fruit tart that really wakes up your taste buds, you've gotta check out this Italian delight. Originating from Italian kitchens, the orange mango tart uses a technique called "cottura alla cieca" to blind-bake the crust, ensuring a crispy shell. Really good stuff. What makes this orange mango tart different is the combo of fresh fruit—sweet mango and zesty orange—spread over a layer of tangy orange jam. Seriously good. In Italy, it's common to arrange thin slices of mango and orange in a rose pattern, creating a look that's as beautiful as it is tasty. And the taste? Each bite bursts with bright, sweet flavors. Pretty simple. The fruit makes it look kinda fancy, even though it’s easy to put together. This dessert fits perfectly at a special family meal or even just a regular afternoon when you want a treat that feels a bit special.
In different parts of Italy, you’ll notice some fun twists.

To prepare the orange and mango tart, first make the crust. Sift the flour and powdered sugar into a bowl, add the grated lemon zest and the butter cut into pieces .
Start kneading with your hands to form a coarse crumbled mixture . Add the eggs and mix them with a spoon into the rest. Transfer the dough onto a work surface and work it quickly with your hands until you get a soft dough ball.
Wrap it in a sheet of clear plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for an hour. Take the dough out and roll it onto the work surface to a thickness of about 1/8 inch . Butter a 7-inch pan and line it with the pastry dough. Trim the edges, cutting off any excess dough ,
prick the bottom with a fork and place a sheet of parchment paper inside. Proceed with blind baking by placing ceramic balls or beans inside the tart. Bake at 356°F for 15 minutes, then remove the base, eliminate the ceramic balls and parchment paper , and bake for another 15 minutes.
Once baking is complete, let the tart base cool completely and remove it from the pan. Fill with orange marmalade , spreading it well throughout the base of the tart .
Peel the mango and cut into thin slices . Arrange them inside the tart, starting from the outside ,
to create a rose . Brush the surface with cold jelly and let the tart rest in the fridge for 20 minutes . Serve and enjoy.
The orange and mango tart can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days under a glass dome.
If you wish, you can replace the cold jelly with more orange marmalade to brush the surface of the tart. You can serve this dessert accompanied by a scoop of vanilla or cream ice cream.
