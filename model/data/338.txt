instructions:
To prepare the orange and lemon marmalade, first, with the help of a zester, remove the zest from the citrus fruits , previously washed and dried, being careful not to take the white part which would give an excessively bitter taste to the final product. Using the specific tool, you will get thin strips; if you don't have it, you can use a peeler and then use a knife to cut the zest into strips. Put the zests in a pot with water and bring to a boil. Then drain the zests and repeat this process two more times, always starting with cold water.
Peel the oranges and lemons alive , cut them into pieces , removing all the white parts and any seeds. Put everything in a pot .
Add the sugar and cook, over low heat, stirring continuously, for 20 minutes or until the sugar starts to thicken . Add the zests and continue cooking, over medium heat, for another 10 minutes.
Do the plate test: put a teaspoon of marmalade on a plate and let it cool, if tilting it doesn't slip away then it's ready. Put it immediately in the jars , previously sterilized, leaving a space of 0.8 inches from the top of the jar. Seal tightly and turn them upside down . Let them cool completely and your orange and lemon marmalade is ready .
Orange and lemon marmalade can be stored for 6 months in a cool, dry place, always check before consuming if the jar has maintained the vacuum seal. Once opened, it can be stored in the refrigerator for 4-5 days.
Homemade preparation of preserves and marmalades can pose health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the necessary conditions and measures to ensure the safety and suitability of the food, which industrial procedures, on the other hand, can ensure to prevent dangerous contaminations. It is therefore important to follow food safety guidelines meticulously to reduce risks, but always keep in mind that you will never achieve the same food safety as preserves and marmalades produced at a professional level. For a correct preparation of homemade preserves, refer to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
