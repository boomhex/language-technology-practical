instructions:
To make Shirazi salad, first prepare the vegetables: trim the cucumbers, then peel them in alternating strips with a vegetable peeler . Cut them in half lengthwise and remove the central seeds, then dice them into fairly small cubes .
Cut the tomatoes in half as well and dice them after removing the seeds . Peel and dice the onion as well .
Transfer the cucumbers to a serving platter along with the tomatoes and onions , then mix well .
Proceed with the dressing: pour the oil into a small bowl , add salt and pepper .
Add the lemon juice , then chop the parsley and basil . Add the chopped herbs and dried mint and emulsify everything.
Drizzle the dressing over the salad and mix well . Shirazi salad is ready to be served !
Shirazi salad can be stored in the refrigerator for one day, but in this case, it is recommended to add the salt just before serving.
Long Dutch cucumbers are the most suitable for this preparation because they are less watery and have fewer seeds; alternatively, you can use regular cucumbers.
Plum tomatoes can be replaced with beefsteak or cherry tomatoes, always making sure to remove the seeds.
