instructions:
With the leftover rib roast from your dinners , begin to prepare the mixture for the boiled meat and ricotta balls. Remove the bone from the meat, obtaining about 14 oz. Cut the boiled meat into pieces, finely chopping them with a knife (2-3).
Transfer the minced meat into a bowl and add the egg , the Parmesan cheese , the breadcrumbs , and mix everything well.
Finely chop the parsley and add it to the mixture . Salt the resulting mixture and work it with your hands. Take about 1 oz of the mixture, gently spread it on the palm of your hand
and place about 0.4 oz of sheep ricotta in the center . Close the meatball, giving it a round shape and ensuring the filling is well-sealed inside : with these quantities, you will obtain about 15 meatballs. Now pour the pistachio flour into one bowl and beat the eggs in another; roll each meatball first in the pistachio flour ,
then in the eggs , and finally again in the pistachio flour . Now your meatballs are ready to be fried .
Immerse them in plenty of oil already hot at about 340°F and cook for a couple of minutes or until they are golden brown. Drain them on paper towels, salt, pepper to taste, and serve your boiled meat and ricotta balls hot !
Store the boiled meat and ricotta balls in the refrigerator and consume them within a day. We do not recommend freezing.
For these boiled meat and ricotta balls, use any type of boiled meat: chicken, hen, beef for boiling, capon. Feel free to fill them with gorgonzola or a soft cheese of your choice.
