Do you remember our baked feta recipe? It is so delicious and captivating that we decided to turn it into a sauce for a first course: baked feta pasta ! Mediterranean flavors have always been a source of inspiration and feta, borrowed from Greek cuisine, seemed the natural choice, paired with sweet cherry tomatoes and our very own taggiasca olives, for a tasty match made in heaven that will win you over as soon as you take your first bite.
To prepare baked feta pasta , place the whole feta on a tray , then add the washed and dried tomatoes , seasoned with the fresh basil leaves .
Drizzle with olive oil and season with black pepper . Bake in a ventilated oven preheated to 392° for 25 minutes. In the meantime, bring some water to the boil in a pan, add salt and cook the pasta until firm to the bite .
In the meantime, remove the tray from the oven , then drain the pasta and add the pitted olives .
Stir to amalgamate the flavors and crumble the feta. Finish by garnishing with dried oregano to taste . Serve the baked feta pasta right away .
Feta tends to dry pasta out so the dish is best enjoyed freshly prepared.
If the pasta is a little dry, add some of the cooking water for a more enveloping sauce.
