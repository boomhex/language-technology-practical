instructions:
To prepare the soft turkey in the pan, first take care of the meat. Cut the turkey breast into chunks of about 3/4 inch . In a well-heated non-stick pan, pour the oil, add the clove of garlic, sage, and rosemary .
Let it brown over low heat. Add the turkey and let it brown over medium heat on both sides , then add salt .
Deglaze with white wine . Let it evaporate, then remove the rosemary branches, sage, and garlic . Add the light cream .
Stir , cover with a lid, and let it cook for about 10 minutes over medium heat. When it is tender and the sauce is creamy , the turkey will be ready, and you can serve it hot .
You can keep the soft turkey in the pan for 1-2 days maximum in the fridge. Alternatively, it can be frozen.
You can replace the cream with:
Plain Greek yogurt : it is the most common substitution for those who want a creamy but light result. Choose it natural, unsweetened, and add it off the heat to prevent it from separating.
Sifted ricotta : gives a delicate creaminess and a slightly sweet taste; you can thin it with a couple of tablespoons of milk or hot broth.
Milk and flour (or cornstarch): thicken 7 oz of milk with a teaspoon of flour or cornstarch, obtaining a velvety sauce similar to cooking cream.
