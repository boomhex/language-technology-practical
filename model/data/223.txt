instructions:
To prepare the stockfish and potatoes stew, first bring some water to a boil. Make a cross cut on the bottom of the tomatoes and immerse them in the boiling water for 1-2 minutes. Drain them and cool them in cold water .
Peel the tomatoes , cut them in half, remove the seeds then finely chop them with a knife and set aside.
Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch cubes . Finely chop the onion .
Do the same for celery and carrots . Cut the stockfish into 2-inch pieces .
In a pan, pour the oil, add the onion and minced garlic . Pour in some water, taken from the total, and stew for 5-6 minutes over medium heat. Place the stockfish in the pan, skin side down .
Sauté for 2-3 minutes. Flip the fish over and sauté for another 2-3 minutes. Deglaze with white wine and let all the alcohol evaporate. Add the tomatoes and potatoes .
Continue with the olives, previously desalted capers , pine nuts , carrots, and celery .
Pour in the remaining water . Season with salt and pepper and mix .
Cover with a lid and cook over medium-low heat for 30 minutes. When cooking is finished, turn off the heat and add the chopped parsley . Mix and plate. Your stockfish and potatoes stew is ready to be enjoyed .
Stockfish and potatoes stew can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days in a closed container. Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer a milder flavor, omit the tomatoes and cook everything in fish broth, perhaps adding a bit of saffron for a more intense aroma. If you don't like garlic, you can omit it. To calculate the weight of the unsoaked stockfish, you can divide the amount by 3. You can soak it in cold water for about 3 days, changing the water every 12 hours.
