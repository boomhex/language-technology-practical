Alright, so here's the deal: gluten-free pastina meatballs bring this fun twist to classic Italian comfort food. I mean, seriously, it’s a creative take from the Italian kitchen. We’re talking tiny star-shaped gluten-free pastina —you know, ‘stelline’—cooked in a flavorful meat broth. This stuff soaks up all that delicious taste. Really good stuff. Instead of using bread or regular pasta, the recipe rolls the pastina into small, bite-sized gluten-free meatballs . And these aren’t just any meatballs: each one is packed with pistachio bits, giving a nutty surprise in every bite—so so tasty. A quick roll in cornmeal makes them crispy, turning them golden and irresistibly fun to eat—una tira l’altra, as they say in Italy. Pretty much means you can't stop at just one!
These little meatballs are really popular in Italy as finger food at parties or as a fun snack that keeps kids coming back. And look, they fit perfectly at a family dinner but are casual enough for movie night too. The soft inside pairs with the crispy outside, and the pistachios blend seamlessly with the savory broth notes. In northern Italy, some folks add a sprinkle of grated cheese or a touch of fresh herbs—really ups the flavor—but the star is always the pastina. And especially when it's gluten-free, so everyone can enjoy it.
These gluten-free meatballs are perfect for anyone looking for new gluten-free pasta dishes or wanting something different for their next gathering. Seriously good stuff. Whether you're planning a party or just making snack time more exciting, these meatballs are sure to delight both kids and adults. With their moist inside, crunchy outside, and nutty finish, it's easy to see why this dish is becoming a favorite for gluten-free comfort food in Italian homes. And you know what? You can’t go wrong with these.
To prepare the gluten-free star pasta balls, start by making the Beef Broth . Clean, cut the vegetables, and transfer them into a pot, also add the meat, and cover everything with 3 liters (3.2 quarts) of water . Let it cook for two hours over medium-high heat, add another 1 liter (1.1 quarts) of water, and finish cooking for an hour over low heat . At the end of cooking, strain the broth
and pour it back into the pot. Bring it back to a boil, take the pasta, and pour it into the pot . Let it cook for about 8 minutes , drain, and let it cool .
Then pour the pasta into a larger bowl, add the eggs , grated cheese , and mix everything. Also add the pistachio crumble
corn flour and cornstarch . Mix the ingredients until you get a uniform mixture and with a spoon take about 0.5 oz (15 g) of the mixture , with wet hands try to get as much as possible a spherical shape by gently pressing the mixture.
As you make the balls, place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper , then roll them in the corn flour and place them again on another tray, also lined with parchment paper . Pour the seed oil into a pot and bring it to a temperature of 338°F (170°C) (in this phase use a kitchen thermometer to measure the exact temperature). Only when the oil is hot, immerse 3-4 balls at a time
and fry them for 4-5 minutes until they are well browned, only then can you drain them . Continue frying the balls in this way, placing them one by one on a tray lined with paper towels, which will serve to absorb the excess oil . Once cooked, serve your gluten-free pasta balls still hot !
It is recommended to consume the gluten-free pasta balls just fried. If you prefer, you can prepare the mixture a few hours in advance, shape them, and store the balls in the refrigerator. When it's time to fry them, it will be enough to roll them in corn flour before frying!
Instead of pistachios, you can use another type of dried fruit, such as almonds, hazelnuts, or pine nuts! You can also flavor the mixture with lemon zest, orange, paprika, or nutmeg!
For gluten-free recipes, we recommend purchasing only products that display the crossed-out wheat symbol on the package, certified gluten-free, recommended by the AIC (Italian Celiac Association) guide.
