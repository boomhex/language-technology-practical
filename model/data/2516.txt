Oh, let me tell you, this mini strudel filanti con verdure is such a treat, especially up in Northern Italy. It's like this perfect blend of a little bit fancy but really, really easy to share. Seriously good. And you know what? People just can't get enough of the crispy pastry and that tender veggie filling. We're talking green beans, carrots, eggplants, zucchini—so moist and lightly cooked.
But honestly, the best part? Those little cubes of provola cheese inside. They melt beautifully when baking, creating this creamy, flavorful center that’s just wow. You get that verdure filanti vibe with gooey, stretchy cheese goodness. And when you bite into the golden puff pastry, it’s like the perfect mix of crispy outside and cheesy-soft inside. Pretty simple.
In places like Trentino or South Tyrol, they love dishes like this, thanks to a cool mix of Italian and Austrian influences. Here, the strudel gets a unique twist with local cheese and veggies. This ricetta strudel salato is awesome for a quick snack, a fun antipasto, or even a second course. People just grab one and, honestly, want more. The flavors are simple, but really hit the spot. For real. That tangy kick from the melted provola in every bite? Can't go wrong.
Whether it's strudel di verdure or just mini veggie strudels, these disappear at any family dinner or party. Which is great. People just love the whole pasta sfoglia ripiena vibe—tender but still crunchy. It’s one of those easy Italian recipes that makes you look like you put in tons of effort, but really, it’s all about good ingredients and classic cucina italiana style. It’s a win for anyone who loves their food a bit cheesy, a bit crunchy, and always ready to share. Perfect for those who dig both tradition and a modern twist in their meals. Really.
To prepare the mini stringy strudels with vegetables, start by cleaning and chopping the vegetables, keeping them separate. After removing the ends, peel the carrots with a vegetable peeler , cut them into long strips , and then dice them .
Continue with the green beans: remove the ends from these as well and cut them into small rounds . Trim the zucchini and slice them lengthwise, reducing each slice into sticks .
Dice these as well . Finally, the eggplants: remove the ends and, like the zucchini, slice them lengthwise, reduce the slices into sticks , and dice them .
Finely chop thyme and rosemary , then move on to the provolone: slice it into fairly thick slices, reduce them into sticks , and finally cube them . Proceed to cook the vegetables.
In a non-stick pan drizzled with olive oil, cook the carrots and green beans and, over moderate heat, sauté them . Now add the zucchini
and the eggplants , then season with salt and pepper . Drizzle the vegetables with water ,
add the chopped herbs and cook for 10 minutes, keeping the vegetables at rest once cooked . Take the dough discs from the package and remove the paper they rest on .
Place a disc on the work surface and fill it with a portion of warm vegetables placed in the center , add the provolone , and moisten the edges with a little water using a pastry brush .
Now fold two sides of the dough inward , then roll the dough disc until you obtain a mini strudel .
Once you have made the 16 mini strudels, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush the surface with beaten egg . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 10 minutes (if using a fan oven, 356°F for 8 minutes): they should be lightly golden . The mini stringy strudels with vegetables are ready : serve them piping hot.
The mini strudels should be consumed as soon as possible, but you can store them in the refrigerator for 2-3 days in an airtight container.
You can also make the mini strudels with homemade or store-bought puff pastry, rolling it out and using a pastry cutter to carve out thin dough discs with a diameter of 4 inches.
