Start the preparation of pan de mej by melting the butter over low heat in a saucepan, then let it cool slightly. Crack the eggs into a large bowl, where you'll add the sugar and seeds from the vanilla bean; beat the ingredients with an electric mixer or whisk until you obtain a creamy mixture, then add the melted, now cool butter, a pinch of salt, and mix.
Mix the cornmeal with all-purpose flour and the packet of baking powder, then sift everything into the bowl containing the liquid ingredients. Mix and combine all the ingredients well until you get a soft but workable dough. Take about 2-2.5 oz of dough at a time and form a ball that you will flatten into a circle 3 inches in diameter; proceed this way until you finish the dough, and place the obtained shapes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and, if you find them available, sprinkle the sweets with elderflowers.
Sprinkle all the shapes with granulated sugar and then with plenty of powdered sugar, then bake in a preheated oven at 355°F for 20 minutes. After the necessary time has passed, take the pan de mej out of the oven and let them cool.
