instructions:
To prepare the pasta with broccoli pesto, start with the pesto: wash the broccoli, divide the florets from the central stem and blanch them for 5 minutes , then drain and put them in a bowl full of ice water to cool and keep the color vibrant.
When the broccoli has cooled, drain them from the ice water and dry them with a paper towel. Transfer the broccoli to a blender, add the basil leaves , peeled almonds, pine nuts, grated Grana Padano PDO , a pinch of salt, and half of the extra virgin olive oil . Blend all the ingredients, and add the remaining oil gradually. If the mixture is too dry, add more oil.
The pesto should be creamy, place it in a small bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling water, salted to taste . Meanwhile, put the pesto in a large pan and dilute it with a ladle of cooking water to make it softer.
Drain the farfalle al dente and transfer them to the pan with the pesto , let it absorb the flavors over low heat for a few minutes, stirring with a spoon. The pasta with broccoli pesto is ready to be served , enjoy it immediately!
Store the pasta with broccoli pesto in the refrigerator for a couple of days covered with plastic wrap; alternatively, you can freeze the pesto in small jars.
You can also replace the farfalle with a long pasta shape, and if you like experimenting, you can try making a version of lasagna with broccoli pesto, with lots of melted cheese!
