instructions:
To make the yogurt naan bread, pour the flour into a bowl, then add the yeast , the plain yogurt , and the water .
Add the salt and mix everything with a spoon, then transfer the dough onto your work surface and knead by hand until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough . Let the dough rest in the bowl, covered with plastic wrap, for about an hour .
After this time, divide the dough into 6 portions , form balls , and roll them out with a rolling pin to form disks approximately 1/8 inch thick . If the dough tends to retract, let the disks rest for a couple of minutes and roll them out again, also using your hands.
Cook the naans in a non-stick pan over high heat for about 3-4 minutes on the first side and 2 minutes on the other side, or until golden brown . Serve your yogurt naan bread while still warm !
The yogurt naan bread can be stored for one day at room temperature.
You can freeze it after cooking.
If you wish, you can flavor the dough with a pinch of turmeric.
Do you have more leftover plain yogurt? Season it with oil, salt, and spices and serve it as a dipping sauce!
