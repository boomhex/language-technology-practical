To prepare the Russian cake from Verona, start by melting the butter over very low heat and let it cool slightly. Then blend the almonds in a mixer with a little sugar taken from the total amount . Also crumble the amaretti cookies with your hands in a small bowl .
Using an electric mixer, beat the eggs with the remaining sugar until you get a frothy, light mixture . Pour the melted butter, now slightly cooled, in a thin stream ,
the crumbled almonds mixed with the sugar , the flour , the baking powder ,
the crumbled amaretti cookies , the sweet almond flavoring , and a pinch of salt .
Mix with the beaters to obtain a homogeneous mixture . Line a 20 cm (8-inch) diameter, high-sided cake pan with parchment paper and arrange the puff pastry inside
so that it overhangs a little from the edge . Pour the mixture , fold the edges inward , and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 60 minutes.
If the cake darkens on top, you can move it to the lower rack of the oven or cover it with aluminum foil until cooking is finished. Once baked, take it out of the oven, let it cool completely before removing from the pan . The Russian cake from Verona can be served decorated with powdered sugar to taste .
The Russian cake from Verona can be kept for 2-3 days under a glass bell.
Freezing is not recommended.
