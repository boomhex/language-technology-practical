Let's start our recipe with cooking the lobsters: throw the four lobsters (each weighing 10.5 oz) into salted boiling water, and after five minutes, drain them. Split them in half lengthwise, remove the vein, take out any sandy sac from the head, and keep the creamy yellow part and, if present, the roe. At this point, detach the meat from the shell without breaking it, and place it back inside. Put the halved lobsters in a pan with a drizzle of oil over high heat and pour champagne over them. Add the well-cleaned and sliced mushrooms, then sprinkle with pepper and adjust the salt. Reduce the champagne by half and pour in the liquid cream, then place in a preheated oven at 428°F for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and sprinkle your lobster with finely julienned truffle. Sprinkle everything with chopped parsley, and here is your lobster with champagne ready. Meanwhile, while the lobster cooks, prepare the Pilaf Rice following the recipe we provide.
In the Mediterranean Sea, there are two different species of lobster: the Palinurus mauritanicus, which is distinguished by the presence of numerous white spots on the shell, and the Palinurus regius, recognizable by its green body, which is said to have been accidentally introduced into the Mediterranean.
If you have some savings and want to impress, lobster with champagne is what you need. If you want to go overboard, you'll need the best ingredients, namely the tail of 'Cuban lobster' from South Africa and Alba truffle. Pay attention to the cooking: respect the indicated times, otherwise you risk ruining such goodness, turning it into tough and stringy meat.
