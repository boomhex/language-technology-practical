To prepare the pasta and fish stew, start by cleaning all the fish: rinse the mussels very well under cold water, discarding any broken or open ones, then remove the beard that protrudes from the shells and scrape the shell with a knife or a new steel wool pad ( How to Clean and Open Mussels ). As for the veraci clams, here's a tip to eliminate the sandy ones: arm yourself with patience and take them one at a time, tap the clam with the edge above a wooden cutting board and check if anything black comes out. If it does, throw away the clam as it will be full of dark sand. Rinse the mantis shrimp under cold water and the razor clams . At this point, fillet the turbot, first remove the dorsal fin with scissors .
and the two lateral fins ; then with the tip of a knife, make a small incision in the stomach to remove the innards . Then skin it with the sharp blade of a knife, at this point bone it and obtain 4 fillets .
In a large pan, prepare a sauté with a crushed garlic clove and some extra virgin olive oil, add the mussels and clams , cover with a lid, and let them open. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, dissolve the tomato paste with a bit of water and add the white wine vinegar . Add the whole mantis shrimp to the now-opened mussels and clams ,
the turbot fillets, and the razor clams , salt, pepper, and add the tomato paste. Cover the pan and cook for about 5/7 minutes. Then add the cherry tomatoes cut into cubes and the chopped parsley. Drain the pasta you have cooked in salted boiling water (we used fresh pasta), add the fish cooking sauce, two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, and toss the pasta . Serve the pasta and fish stew by placing a slice of turbot fillet on each plate, then the pasta, and finally mussels, clams, mantis shrimp, and razor clams.
