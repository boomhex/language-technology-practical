Among the no-bake desserts, it is certainly the most loved for its simple goodness! Today we offer it in a lighter version: we are talking about the sugar-free chocolate salami ! We usually prepare the classic chocolate salami, perhaps with milk or dark chocolate left over from Easter eggs, a simple recipe without cooking with very few ingredients. No oven, no mixer (or whisk) and in this case also no added sugar, just a sprinkling of icing sugar to simulate the external patina of real salami! The result will be a sliced dessert that will tempt all your guests!
To prepare the sugar-free chocolate salami , toast the hazelnuts in a pan for a few minutes, turning them often to brown them evenly . Chop them with a knife .
Chop the dark chocolate , place it in a saucepan to melt it in bain-marie , over moderate heat. Once ready, let it cool.
Let's crumble the dry cookies and pour them into a bowl. In the same one, add the chopped toasted hazelnuts and the yogurt .
Pour the melted chocolate and cocoa powder . Mix until you get a homogeneous mixture .
Transfer the mixture on a parchment paper sheet , wrap the paper around it and compact it to give it a cylindrical shape .
Wrap the chocolate salami in plastic wrap. Close the ends and let it rest for 3 hours or more in the refrigerator. After this time, remove the wrap and sprinkle with icing sugar to taste .
Sugar-free chocolate salami can be kept in the fridge for a couple of days.
You can freeze it.
We recommend using a 65% dark chocolate for an optimal yield in terms of taste.
