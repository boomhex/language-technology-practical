To prepare the purple carrot cupcakes, start by peeling the purple carrots , remove their ends and finely chop them in a mixer . With a stand mixer, beat the eggs together with the sugar until you get a well-light and frothy mixture ;
at this point add the chopped carrots to the mixture , the cornstarch and all-purpose flour, almond flour, well-sifted baking powder , and the vanilla seeds extracted from the pod. Blend the mixture and also add the grated lemon zest (or orange) .
Lastly, add the seed oil little by little , mixing well. The batter should be very soft; if it isn't, add 1-2 tablespoons of milk at room temperature. Let the batter rest for about 30 minutes at room temperature; this way, the color of the purple carrot will blend with the other ingredients. Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners and with the help of two spoons fill each liner , leaving an inch from the top to prevent the mixture from spilling over during baking . Then bake at 356°F for about 25 minutes, checking the cupcakes' doneness with a wooden toothpick. Remove the purple carrot cupcakes from the oven and let them cool completely before decorating.
To make the frosting for the cupcakes, mix 7 oz of mascarpone with 7 oz of cream cheese (like Philadelphia) and 1.75 oz of powdered sugar. Put the mixture into a piping bag with a star nozzle and decorate your purple carrot cupcakes!
