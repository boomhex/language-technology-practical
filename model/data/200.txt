instructions:
To prepare the savory potato and bacon pie, start with the potatoes: wash them, peel them , and cut them into cubes . Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the potatoes for 2-3 minutes .
Drain the potatoes and let them cool. Meanwhile, cut the bacon into small cubes . In a bowl, pour the eggs and cream .
Beat the mixture with a whisk , then season with salt and pepper and mix again. At this point, unroll the puff pastry and place it with its parchment paper in a mold with a diameter of 11 inches .
Spread the cooled potatoes , grated cheese , and bacon over the base.
Finally, pour the egg and cream mixture . Fold the edges of the puff pastry inward to create a decorative pattern and bake in a preheated convection oven at 355°F for about 30 minutes . When the surface is golden brown, remove from the oven and garnish with fresh oregano if desired . Your savory potato and bacon pie is ready to be served!
The savory potato and bacon pie can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, but keep in mind that the puff pastry will tend to lose its crispness.
If you prefer, you can replace the bacon with pan-fried sausage pieces.
For a vegetarian variant, you can enrich the filling with cheeses and aromatic herbs!
