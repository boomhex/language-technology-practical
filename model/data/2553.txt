To prepare the lollipop cookies, start with the dough: in the bowl of a mixer, pour the sifted flour and cold butter cut into pieces . Then turn the blades on and create the sabling ; transfer everything onto a work surface. Sift the powdered sugar .
Extract the seeds from the vanilla bean and add everything to the rest of the mixture. Pour the eggs into the center of the well and start mixing first with a fork , then by hand, kneading very quickly so as not to warm the dough too much . When you have obtained a compact mixture, form a ball, flatten it slightly, and wrap it in plastic wrap . Let it firm up in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
After the necessary time, take the dough again, lightly flour the work surface, and roll it out with a rolling pin into a disc about 3/8 inch thick (7-8). Then, using cookie cutters in the shape of flowers, hearts, and stars, cut out the dough : with these doses, you will get 12.
Skewer the obtained cookies with a stick then place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 25 minutes (320°F for about 15 minutes if using a fan oven) ; when they are cooked, you can take them out of the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack.
While the cookies are baking, prepare the decoration: take the marzipan and divide it into 4 equal parts . Color each piece with the yellow, blue, red food colors, and one with yellow and blue to create the green color . Mix the colors well and form marzipan balls .
Roll out each ball into a thin disc and cut them with the same cookie shapes to decorate them . Spread a little edible glue on the marzipan shape and lay it on each cookie (the cookies must be completely cold) .
At this point, you can decorate them however you prefer, for example with gel decorations to finish the edges of the cookies ; then enrich them with chocolate confetti to always lay with edible glue for a great effect. Your lollipop cookies are ready to be enjoyed .
The decorated cookies can be stored for 2-3 days under a glass dome.
The dough can be frozen and defrosted in the refrigerator before using it.
If you prefer, you can also make the cookies with orange or lemon-flavored dough!
