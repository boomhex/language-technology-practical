instructions:
To prepare the lemon plumcake without butter, start by working the eggs and 6.3 oz of brown sugar in a bowl . Beat for a moment with a whisk before adding the oil in a steady stream .
Once the fat has been absorbed, add the lemon juice and grated lemon zest . While continuing to stir, add the salt ,
the almond milk , type 2 flour, baking powder , and almond flour .
Always working with the whisk, mix everything well to obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture . Pour it into an oil-greased and floured mold. The dimensions of the mold are 8.7x3.1 inches at the bottom and 10x4 inches at the top . Sprinkle the surface with coarsely chopped almonds .
and the 0.7 oz of brown sugar for the surface . The olive oil and lemon plumcake is ready to bake in the middle shelf in a preheated static oven at 356°F, for about 55-60 minutes. Always do the toothpick test before taking it out, and if after 30-40 minutes the surface browns too much, cover with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Once cooked, let it cool before unmolding .
You can store the plumcake for 2-3 days under a glass dome.
If you want, you can also freeze it, preferably already sliced.
Do you want to enrich your lemon plumcake without butter even more? Add pieces of candied ginger on top. Instead of almonds, you can use hazelnuts, and finally instead of olive oil, use corn or sunflower oil!
