instructions:
To prepare the apricot and cream tart, start by making the shortcrust pastry using the sablage method. Pour the flour into a mixer with the cold butter cut into pieces . Pulse the blades several times to obtain a sandy mixture. At this point, add the sugar, the slightly beaten egg , and the grated lemon zest . Pulse the blades again for a few seconds at low speed.
When the mixture is blended , transfer it to the work surface. Quickly compact it with your hands to form a dough and wrap it in plastic wrap. Let it rest in the refrigerator for at least half an hour. Meanwhile, prepare the custard. Pour the whole milk into a saucepan with the zest of half a lemon and heat it over low heat .
In a bowl, combine the sugar and egg yolks , whisk them together until you obtain a smooth and light cream. Also add the sifted flour and continue to mix until you have a homogeneous mixture. Gradually add the warmed milk, filtering it with a strainer , and mix the cream with the whisk.
Pour the mixture into a non-stick saucepan and stir with a spoon while cooking over low heat . Let the custard cook, stirring constantly, until it thickens . This will take a few minutes. Transfer the cream to a bowl, cover with cling film in contact, and let it cool .
Take the shortcrust pastry and roll it out between two lightly floured baking sheets with a rolling pin . Line a tart pan with a diameter of 9 1/2 inches (24 cm), previously buttered. Trim the excess pastry with a small knife. Prick it with the tines of a fork .
Then cover the shortcrust pastry with a sheet of baking paper and pour dried beans or ceramic baking weights over it . Bake the shortcrust pastry in a preheated static oven at 355°F (180°C) on the middle rack for about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, remove the baking paper with the dried beans , and let it cool. Wash and dry the apricots well. Cut them in half and remove the stone .
Spread the cooled cream in the center of the tart and level it using the back of a spoon . Place the apricot halves with the skin side facing up . Sprinkle with brown sugar. Bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F (180°C) for about 25 minutes; this way, the apricots will become softer and slightly caramelized. Remove from the oven and let cool completely. Transfer to a serving plate and decorate the apricot and cream tart with mint leaves .
The apricot and cream tart can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days. You can prepare both the shortcrust pastry and the cream in advance.
You can replace the mint leaves with chopped or flaked almonds. To make the shortcrust pastry, you can use a stand mixer instead of a mixer, or you can knead by hand, being careful to work the pastry quickly to avoid overheating it. If you have one, use a pan with a removable bottom and perforated surface, but other glass, ceramic, or non-stick pans suitable for oven baking will also work.
