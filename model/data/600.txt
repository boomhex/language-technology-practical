To prepare the Lodi Easter lamb, start with the puff pastry: in the bowl of the stand mixer equipped with a hook, pour the flour, fresh liquid cream and salt , then turn on the machine until you obtain a soft and homogeneous dough .
Transfer it to the work surface and knead it briefly to form a dough ball . Let it rest in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, take a sheet of parchment paper and place the butter in the center .
Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and roll out the butter with a rolling pin to make it thinner , then transfer it to the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Once rested, roll out the dough on the floured work surface with the rolling pin .
Roll out the dough to reach a size sufficient to insert the butter block diagonally , then fold the edges of the dough towards the center one over the other to perfectly enclose the butter .
Dust the surface with a little flour, put just a bit on top of the dough block as well, and using a rolling pin, roll only in the direction in front of you, to obtain a rectangle that extends only in length and not in width : Fold the two side edges of the short side towards the center .
Press the dough block with your index finger to mark the first rest . Place it on a tray, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rest for 30 minutes in the refrigerator . Meanwhile, prepare the pastry cream: soak the gelatin in cold water .
Heat the milk with the vanilla bean, without the seeds, and lemon zest . Meanwhile, pour the eggs, the vanilla bean seeds removed earlier, and the sugar into a bowl. Mix with a whisk to combine, then incorporate the starch .
Pour the hot milk over the egg mixture through a strainer to catch the lemon zest and vanilla bean , mix to combine , and return to the heat .
Thicken the cream, stirring constantly with the whisk, then turn off the heat and add the drained and squeezed gelatin . Stir to dissolve it, then transfer the cream to a baking dish. Let it cool, then cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge to set . Take the dough block and make the second fold of the puff pastry in the direction of the folds .
You need to achieve a thickness of 0.4 inches , then refold the side edges as the first time and mark with two fingers the second rest .
Let it rest again for another 30 minutes in the refrigerator, wrapping the dough block with plastic wrap . Meanwhile, take the cream and soften it with the whisk . In a separate bowl, whip the cream with the beaters .
The cream should be semi-whipped . Gradually fold the semi-whipped cream into the cream stirring from bottom to top with a spatula until well incorporated .
Transfer the diplomatic cream into a piping bag without a nozzle and keep it in the refrigerator until ready to use. Take the dough block and roll it out to make the third fold : form a rectangular puff pastry again, 0.4 inches thick .
Fold the edges towards the center , then mark with 3 fingers the third and final rest . Always let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes covered with plastic wrap. After this time, take the dough block and roll it out with the rolling pin on the work surface .
Now you need to obtain a puff pastry approximately 0.3 inches thick. Place the cardboard shape of the lamb here, we created a 8x8 inches drawing. Use a craft knife to cut the puff pastry . Place the puff pastry shapes on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, brush the surface with some egg yolk and dust with granulated sugar .
Bake the puff pastry lambs in the preheated fan oven at 350°F for 20 minutes. Once baked, remove from the oven and let cool completely . Cut the lambs in half horizontally , so they can be filled .
Now fill the base of the lamb with cream by piping dollops with the piping bag . Close with the top half and serve the Lodi Easter lamb immediately !
Once filled, the Lodi Easter lamb will retain its crispness for a few hours but should be stored in the refrigerator. The next day it might be less crispy.
The cream can be prepared a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap.
The puff pastry can also be baked a day in advance and stored sheltered from air under a glass dome.
If you are familiar with these preparations, you can knead by hand instead of using the stand mixer.
