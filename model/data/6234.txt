instructions:
To prepare lemon scalloppini , start by squeezing the fruit to obtain the juice . Then cover the meat with parchment paper, so as not to tear the fibers , and beat using a tenderizer. Strike firmly but not too hard, to tenderize the tissues without tearing the pulp .
Coat the sliced veal in flour , remove any excess flour, then melt the butter on a low flame in a capacious pan and add the sliced veal. Turn up the flame and brown for a couple of minutes on one side and then on the other .
Add salt and black pepper to taste , then add the lemon juice to the pan and cook on a low flame for 2-3 minutes . As soon as the sauce thickens and becomes creamy, remove from the flame and serve the lemon scalloppini immediately !
Lemon scalloppini are best enjoyed right away. If you want to store them, leave them in the refrigerator for no longer than 1 day, inside a resealable glass container.
Freezing is not recommended.
Add some flavor to you lemon scalloppini with some aromatic herbs to taste, such as rosemary or thyme. For an even creamier sauce, simply add a teaspoon tip of corn starch! For a gluten-free version, coat the sliced veal in corn flour or rice starch!
