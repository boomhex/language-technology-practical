instructions:
To prepare the baked zucchini meatballs, start by washing the zucchini and trimming one end , then grate them using a large-holed grater and set aside. If your zucchini seem particularly watery, place them in a colander with a weight on top to drain the excess water. Then, cut the bread into cubes .
Transfer it to the mixer bowl and blend to create crumbs. Add the egg and grated zucchini .
Also add the grated cheese , chopped parsley , and season with salt and pepper .
Close the mixer and blend briefly, just enough to mix . Now, take about 0.6 oz (18 g) of the mixture, compact it between slightly oiled hands, and shape into round meatballs .
Arrange them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and drizzle with a bit of oil . Bake on the middle rack of a static oven at 392°F (200°C) for 20 minutes. Then, move the baking sheet to a slightly higher rack and continue baking for another 8-10 minutes for a perfect golden finish . Serve your baked zucchini meatballs warm or hot, with a pinch of salt on top and yogurt sauce to taste .
The baked zucchini meatballs can be stored in the fridge, covered, for 2 days. They can be frozen after being cooked.
For a simple and tasty dipping sauce, mix plain yogurt, extra virgin olive oil, salt, and a bit of parsley!
