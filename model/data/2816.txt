It's not just a sidekick; those crisp artichoke hearts are sliced thin and tossed with a simple vinaigrette. So fresh. They bring a crunch that perfectly balances the richness.

To prepare the potato flan with artichoke salad, start by boiling the potatoes : cook them until you can pierce them with a fork (to shorten cooking times you can use a pressure cooker). Once cooked, drain them and let them cool slightly. Then mash them with a potato masher, collecting them in a bowl ; separate the whites from the yolks and add the yolks to the potatoes , stirring with a wooden spoon to absorb them.
Take the Tilsit cheese and cut it into cubes , then add it to the bowl with the potatoes . Also add the Pecorino, then the lukewarm milk gradually ,
salt and pepper to taste and chopped chives . Also grate the nutmeg to flavor the mixture . In a separate small bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff with electric whisks ,
until they are white, firm, and frothy . Gently fold them into the potato mixture and mix with a spatula from top to bottom to avoid deflating them .
Once you have incorporated the egg whites, take 6 molds with a capacity of about 5.4 oz each; butter them and line them with parchment paper, then divide the mixture into six equal parts, filling the molds to the edge . Place the molds in a high-rimmed baking dish and fill it with hot (but not boiling) water up to 3/4 , to cook in a bain-marie in the oven: this way the right humidity will be created so the flans remain soft and don't dry out too much during cooking. Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 1 hour (if using a fan oven, at 320°F for 50 minutes). Meanwhile, prepare the artichoke salad: clean the artichokes by cutting off the sharper top part and peeling them until you reach the more tender leaves .
Then clean the stem by removing the outermost part and immerse the cleaned artichokes in a bowl with water and lemon to prevent them from darkening . At this point, cut the artichokes in half and with a knife remove the inner fuzz , then cut them into julienne strips
and drizzle them with a little olive oil ; you can season to taste with salt and pepper to flavor them. Distribute the artichoke salad on a serving plate . Once the potato flans are cooked, take them out of the oven and let them cool slightly.
Turn the potato flan over in the center , take the Parmigiano Reggiano and make shavings to distribute over and around the potato flan with artichoke salad !
Keep the flans in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 1 day. You can slightly warm them in the microwave or oven before serving. You can freeze the flans if you have used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
If you prefer, you can flavor the flans with chopped rosemary, sage, or marjoram instead of chives!
