instructions:
To prepare the seven-layer salad, start by placing the eggs in a saucepan and boiling them to harden; once the eggs are cooked, let them cool. Place the bacon slices on a grill and cook them until they become crispy. Meanwhile, cook the frozen peas , being careful not to overcook them; they should remain whole. Slice the tomatoes and cut the Cheddar slices into thin strips.
At this point, start assembling the salad: take a large bowl with a diameter of about 8 inches and start composing the seven layers, starting with the tomato slices which should cover the base of the bowl, add the peas trying to distribute them evenly, continue by placing the Cheddar strips in a radial pattern ,
add a layer of olives and a layer of bacon strips , cover with lettuce leaves . Finish the composition with the hard-boiled eggs cut into quarters. Serve the seven-layer salad and dress it to taste with oil, salt, and vinegar.
The seven-layer salad is generally accompanied by sauces very popular in the USA, such as Ranch dressing made with buttermilk, mayonnaise, salt, garlic, onion, mustard, herbs (commonly chives, parsley, and dill), and spices (black pepper, paprika). Alternatively, you can dress the salad with a simple vinaigrette made by emulsifying oil, salt, vinegar or lemon juice, pepper, herbs, and spices. You can also replace Cheddar cheese with another type of sliced cheese of your choice. Have fun personalizing the salad with the ingredients you prefer.
