instructions:
To prepare the pasta with potato cream and sausage, start by boiling the whole potatoes for about 40 minutes , or until they are soft. Use a potato masher to puree them , then add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano DOP .
Add powdered saffron , salt, and pepper. Mix to obtain a rather thick and homogeneous mixture .
Remove the casing from the sausage, crumble it, and place it in a slightly heated skillet (without adding any fats) . Brown it for a few minutes, stirring often , until it becomes golden .
In the meantime, cook the pasta for the time indicated on the package . While it cooks, soften the potato and saffron mixture with cooking water , then blend with an immersion blender .
You should obtain a smooth and rather fluid cream . Drain the pasta into the pan with the sausage , add the potato cream .
Also, add a ladle of cooking water , or as much as needed to dilute and mix the sauce . The pasta with potato cream and sausage is ready to enjoy !
We recommend consuming the pasta with potato cream and pancetta immediately.
You can also cook the potatoes in the microwave or steam them.
