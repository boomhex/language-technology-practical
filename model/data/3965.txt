Nice for both kids and adults who love garlic, cheese, and a crispy bite they can dip, share, and enjoy together.
To make the fried bombs, start by sifting 3/4 cup of flour into a bowl , then dissolve the sugar and dry yeast in 1/2 cup of warm milk and mix with a spoon (alternatively, you can use 0.42 oz of fresh yeast instead of dry yeast).
Add the milk and yeast mixture to the flour and mix with a spoon until you obtain a homogeneous batter. Seal the bowl with plastic wrap and let the mixture rise in the oven with the light on for an hour or until its volume has doubled. Meanwhile, sift the remaining flour (3 1/2 cups) into a bowl, add the grated peel of a large lemon , and the seeds from a vanilla bean.
Transfer the mixture to a stand mixer with a paddle attachment , retrieve the now-risen batter , and incorporate it into the dough ,
separately dissolve the salt in the remaining 1/2 cup of milk and add it to the dough . Turn on the mixer to knead the ingredients. Lastly, add the softened butter .
When you have gathered all the ingredients and the mixture detaches from the sides of the bowl , knead the dough ball on a floured surface for at least ten minutes until you get a soft, smooth, and elastic dough, form a ball and place it in a bowl that you will seal with plastic wrap and let rise for two hours. After the necessary time has passed, take the bombs dough that will have doubled its volume and gently roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured surface until it is about 1/2 inch thick .
Using a circular cutter (or a glass) about 3 inches in diameter, cut out many discs from the sheet , trying to make the most of the dough surface, considering that you cannot knead the leftover scraps together: to avoid wasting them, you can still fry them as they are. Place the obtained discs on a clean, dry, and lightly floured towel, spacing them at least 1 inch apart ; cover them with a cloth, waiting about 30 minutes for the second rise. After the rising time, you can cook the bombs: one of the secrets to successful fried bombs is the temperature of the oil, which must be hot but not boiling (around 340°F); you could test by frying a piece of dough: if it slowly turns golden, the oil is ready. If the piece of dough darkens too quickly, the oil is too hot and there is a risk that the inside of the bombs will remain raw while the outside burns. Immerse the fried bombs in the oil and cook them until they are golden brown ,
once cooked, drain them and let them drip on a tray covered with parchment paper and then pass them while still hot in plenty of granulated sugar , making it adhere to the entire surface. Place the ready fried bombs on a tray and serve immediately . If you wish, before rolling them in sugar, you can fill the fried bombs with jam, custard, or chocolate cream, using a pastry syringe.
It is recommended to consume the fried bombs as soon as they are made or to store them under a glass dome for a day at most. It is possible to freeze the fried bombs raw.
When you dip the bombs in hot oil, wait 5 seconds and then turn them to the other side; turn them several times on both surfaces until optimal golden brown is reached, to avoid unsightly bulges. Fried bombs should be consumed while still warm or at most within a few hours of preparation, to retain all their fragrance.
