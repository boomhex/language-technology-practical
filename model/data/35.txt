instructions:
To prepare the baked cod gratin, first pour the breadcrumbs , capers , and well-drained anchovies into a mixer.
Add also the chopped chives , a pinch of salt , a grind of pepper, and blend everything .
Set the breading aside and move on to the potatoes: peel and cut them first in half and then into cubes . Wash and also halve the cherry tomatoes .
Transfer the cherry tomatoes to a bowl, season them with oil , powdered sugar , salt, and oregano .
Mix well . Now pass the cod in the breading to coat all sides well .
Place it in a large baking dish (we used a 12x8 inch one) previously greased with a drizzle of oil , then distribute the potatoes and cherry tomatoes with all their juice around it .
Season with another drizzle of oil and bake at 374°F for about 45-50 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve your baked cod gratin immediately !
The baked cod gratin can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of 1-2 days in an airtight container. If you used all fresh ingredients, it can be frozen.
Enrich the breading with grated cheese, Grana or Pecorino for a stronger flavor. Scent it with a small clove of garlic or grated lemon zest!
