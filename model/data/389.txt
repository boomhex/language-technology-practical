To clean and fillet the greater amberjack, you will need: a pair of kitchen scissors, a sharp knife, and a "scaler," very useful for removing the fish scales. If you don't have one, you can make do with a simple kitchen knife. Place the greater amberjack on the cutting board and begin to gut it. Using the scissors, make a cut along the belly and go up to just below the head , remove the viscera , and rinse the inside under running water to remove all impurities. With the scissors, cut off the side fins .
Also remove the fins located on the back and belly . Carefully scale with the appropriate tool , or with the back of a knife. Once washed, both inside and outside, the greater amberjack is ready to be seasoned and cooked. If you need the fillets, make a diagonal cut, just after the gills, starting from the back and connecting with the cut previously made on the belly .
Cut along the tail and dorsal side of the fish following the backbone , once you have obtained the first fillet , proceed in the same way for the second .
Remove the lowest part of the belly , use pliers to remove any bones , being careful not to tear the flesh. Hold the fillet by the tail, make a small incision, and slide the knife to remove the skin . The greater amberjack fillets are ready to be cooked.
You can store the greater amberjack fillets in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for one day. Alternatively, if you have used fresh fish, you can freeze the fillets.
With the head and bones, you can make a great fish stock or to add flavor to a broth.
