Salmon bites with grapefruit salad totally bring a whole new vibe to the idea of a salmon appetizer . And these little pieces of smoked salmon? Really good stuff. They're a super easy and fresh option, especially when you want something lighter than the usual sushi scene. In Japanese-style eating, these salmon bites fit right in, but with a twist. Thing is, instead of raw fish, smoked salmon gets used—so you skip any worry about freezing or handling super fresh seafood. This swap makes the dish extra convenient and kind of tender too, because the smoked fish has a moist texture and a slightly salty flavor. Seriously good with the pop of citrus.
The grapefruit salad part is all about that tangy taste, mixing juicy grapefruit with greens and maybe a bit of onion or fresh herbs. And listen, people in Japan sometimes pack these up in little glass jars for picnics or friendly get-togethers—pretty much perfect for sharing.
If you love a good citrus salad or are always searching for a healthy salmon recipe , this one really really stands out. The way the sweet notes of grapefruit play with the savory salmon?

Friends will probably ask for the recipe, honestly, since it works for anyone looking for a quick appetizer that's both light and full of flavor. Instead of the usual grilled or baked salmon bites, this recipe makes the most of simple, fresh stuff. Sometimes the best food is the one that's easiest to share and enjoy together.

To prepare the salmon bites with grapefruit salad, start by cooking the rice. Take a high-sided saucepan and add water and rice . Cover with the lid and bring to a boil . When the water boils, lower the heat and let it cook on low heat for about 15 minutes. Never stir the rice while cooking. When it's cooked, transfer the rice to a bowl and add the vinegar .
Gently stir the rice with a spoon or wooden spatula until it reaches room temperature (you can fan it with a small fan or a plastic plate to cool it and let the vinegar evaporate faster) and set it aside. At this point, prepare the dressing. Take one of the grapefruits, squeeze it to obtain the juice . Then transfer it to a small bowl
and whisk it quickly while pouring the oil in a thin stream to better emulsify the mixture. Season with salt and pepper . Then peel the other grapefruit
and slice it first into rounds , then into strips , and finally into small cubes .
Rinse, dry, and transfer the salad greens into a large bowl, add the grapefruit cubes and mix . Dress with a bit of the grapefruit dressing you prepared earlier (try to dress at the last moment so the salad doesn’t wilt) and mix again .
Then divide the salad into 4 glass jars (or in 4 small bowls) and assemble the salmon bites: place a slice of smoked salmon on the surface, add a bit of rice lightly pressed with your hands and roll it to create a roll .
Do the same for the others, then divide them in half with a very sharp knife and place 3 in each jar. Dress with the remaining grapefruit dressing and serve your salmon bites with grapefruit salad .
It is recommended to consume the salmon bites with grapefruit salad immediately. Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of the grapefruit dressing, you can make a citrus mayonnaise: check out the procedure and ingredients in this recipe: Shellfish with steamed vegetables and citrus mayonnaise
