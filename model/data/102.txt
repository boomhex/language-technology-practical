instructions:
To prepare the stewed squid, start by How to clean squid : separate the bodies from the tentacles and remove the pen, the thin transparent cartilage stick found inside the mantle . Extract the entrails and rinse the body and tentacles under running water . Once cleaned, cut the bodies into regular rings .
Divide the tentacles in half or quarters, depending on their size . In a large pan, pour a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, add the garlic and chili pepper , and sauté for a few minutes over low heat until the garlic is golden. Add the squid and let it flavor well.
Also add the desalted capers . After about two minutes, deglaze with the white wine and let the alcohol content evaporate completely. At this point, incorporate the tomato paste .
Pour in the tomato puree , then season with salt and pepper .
Stir, cover with a lid leaving just a small crack for the steam to escape , and continue cooking for about twenty minutes, until the squid is tender and the sauce is thick and flavorful . Serve the stewed squid piping hot, accompanied by toasted bread to soak up the tasty sauce .
You can store the stewed squid in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
If you have used fresh ingredients, it is also possible to freeze them.
To make the sauce even more flavorful, add some Taggiasca olives or a pinch of oregano during cooking: the Mediterranean aroma will be irresistible.
