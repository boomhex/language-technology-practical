Pasta with fava beans and guanciale? It’s that dish you’ve just gotta try if you’re ever in Rome, especially in the spring. You get this amazing mix of fresh flavors and a little crunch that makes it impossible not to grab another serving. Really. It belongs right there in a cozy osteria, where bowls of pasta with fava beans get topped with Pecorino romano—sounds perfect, right? And the laughter, echoing off those checkered tablecloths, adds this charming touch.
The folks in Lazio are big fans of mezze maniche pasta. Why? Because it lets the tender broad beans and those bits of guanciale snuggle into each bite. Plus, when the guanciale gets crispy, you get this salty, savory punch that pairs so, so well with the sweet and earthy taste of fresh broad beans. Honestly, a sprinkle of fava bean pasta recipe magic—basically that perfect balance of cheese, beans, and pork—ties everything together, making it pretty simple yet seriously satisfying.
In Rome, meals like this aren’t rushed. Nope. People love passing around a big bowl of pasta with guanciale , sipping some red wine, sharing stories, and enjoying the moment. It's special, but not too fancy, you know? This dish is all about spring, when broad beans are at their absolute best—green, moist, freshly picked, and packed with flavor. That rustic vibe, with chunks of crispy pork cheek and sharp cheese, really shows why traditional Italian pasta has such charm.
Now, some families might swap in pancetta if they can’t find guanciale, but nothing beats how the real stuff melts and turns golden at the edges. With this recipe, you’re getting the heart of Roman cuisine—simple, honest, meant for sharing. So when the weather warms up and those broad beans hit the market, this is the fava bean pasta recipe that brings everyone together. It captures everything about spring in Italy: good company, good food, and all those rich flavors. A truly beautiful culinary experience that sticks with you long after the meal’s done. For sure.
To prepare pasta with fava beans and guanciale, start with the latter. Cut the guanciale into strips , then place it in a slightly heated pan without adding any extra fats , allowing it to render: it will release all the fat and become very crispy . It will take about 15 minutes over medium heat: stir often with a spatula.
Meanwhile, bring some water to a boil in a saucepan: you'll need it to blanch the fava beans for about 3 minutes , just enough time to soften the outer skin. Drain them, leaving the cooking water in the saucepan, which you'll use to boil the pasta . After blanching the fava beans, shelling them will be easier .
In the same water where you cooked the fava beans, cook the pasta al dente for a few minutes less than the time indicated on the package. Then add it to the pan with the now crispy guanciale , turn on low heat and add the shelled fava beans , grated Pecorino , and pepper to taste.
Add some cooking water to blend and stir for a few moments to flavor all the ingredients and let the Pecorino melt. Your pasta with fava beans and guanciale is ready to be enjoyed; serve it while still hot !
Store pasta with fava beans and guanciale in the fridge for up to 1 day.
Freezing is not recommended.
You can use sweet pancetta instead of guanciale and flavor with thyme or chives if you prefer!
