To prepare the savory ball-shaped pie, start with the brioche bread base: in the bowl of a stand mixer, pour the sifted flours, grated Grana cheese, sugar, and instant yeast ; also add the milk at room temperature gradually and start activating the paddle attachment. When the milk has been absorbed, add the water at room temperature .
Then also add the whole eggs and the yolk little by little , grate the nutmeg, and when the eggs have been absorbed, replace the paddle with the hook attachment. Add a pinch of pepper for flavor and the room temperature butter in pieces, waiting for each piece to fully incorporate before proceeding . Finally, add the salt to the dough and continue working it for at least 15 minutes.
When the dough is smooth and cascades like a ribbon , stop the mixer and place it in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap . Let it rise for at least 30 minutes in a warm place (under a woolen blanket or in a turned-off oven with the light on). In the meantime, dedicate yourself to the filling: finely chop the basil ,
the prosciutto (you can set aside 2 whole slices of prosciutto), slice the tomato , and wash the lettuce leaves. In a bowl, pour the fresh spreadable cheese and soften it by mixing with a whisk, season with a drizzle of oil, add the fresh cream to thin and the grated Grana cheese .
Sprinkle the cream with nutmeg and mix everything. Then divide the mixture into two equal parts in two small bowls and add the chopped basil to one , and the prosciutto to the other . Mix and transfer the two creams into two separate piping bags to store in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Take the dough that has doubled in volume Handle it briefly to give it a round shape then place it in a 1.8 qt capacity mold (you can use a zuccotto mold if you don't have a ball-shaped one) and let it rise in a turned-off oven with the light on for at least 2 hours; after the necessary time, the dough should have reached the edges of the mold. Then bake the brioche bread in a preheated static oven at 340°F for about 60 minutes (300°F for 50 minutes if using a fan oven).
Once cooked, take it out of the oven and let it cool slightly, then gently unmold it and let it cool completely on a wire rack. When it is cold, cut around the entire perimeter of the pie with a small knife, leaving about 0.6-0.8 inches from the edge . Scoop out the inside reaching the bottom to form a cavity (being careful not to pierce it). You can make 2 slices with the inner part , which will be the layers alternated with the creams (with the leftover brioche bread, you can make cubes to toast in the oven).
Then take the piping bags with the creams and start filling the ball-shaped pie with all the basil cream at the bottom , then add the whole slices of prosciutto , cover with a layer of brioche bread and continue with all the prosciutto cream.
Place the lettuce and tomato slices . Then close with the base of the ball-shaped pie . Now place the pie in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, covered with plastic wrap, and in the meantime, dedicate yourself to the covering: in a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat, then sprinkle in the sifted flour and mix with a whisk to obtain the roux. When it is golden, add the milk gradually , mix, and let it heat up.
When the mixture thickens and boils, adjust the salt and add the grated Fontina cheese . Turn off the heat and stir to melt it completely; you can adjust the salt if necessary. Let the béchamel cool slightly and then pour it over the ball-shaped pie placed on a wire rack . Place the pie back in the refrigerator to firm up for at least 1 hour. While it solidifies, prepare the garnish: remove the tops from the red and green peppers, eliminate the seeds and internal filaments, and cut into strips ;
you will need to obtain 11 hexagons about 2 inches on each side (31-32). Blanch them for a few moments in boiling water, then drain them and let them cool completely on absorbent paper.
Then place the ball-shaped pie on a serving dish, and start placing the hexagons alternately on the pie, starting from the central hexagon, to create the typical ball surface; also leave some empty spaces (34-35), to get a tricolor pattern. Serve the savory ball-shaped pie with curly parsley or salad around it to simulate the green soccer field !
You can store the ball-shaped pie in the refrigerator in a container for 1-2 days. The brioche bread can be frozen after rising and thawed as needed.
If you don't have a stand mixer, arm yourself with patience: you can knead by hand on a work surface or a large bowl! For the dough of the pie, you can also use fresh brewer's yeast: in this case, use 12 grams.
