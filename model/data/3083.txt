Sfoglia alle olive con cipolle caramellate is a real gem in Lombardy, especially around the Lodigiano area. It’s where the olive and caramelized onion tart gets that unique twist. I mean, this thing’s got golden layers of puff pastry, briny olives, and a heap of sweet, slow-cooked onions that just melt in your mouth. Really, it’s amazing. What makes this puff pastry tart with olives and onions special is the Raspadüra—those delicate, tender shavings of Grana cheese, sliced straight from the wheel.
In Lombardy, they use a special knife—seriously—to make cheese that’s light, a bit nutty, and strong enough to stand up to those onions. If Raspadüra isn’t around, regular Grana flakes will do, but trust me, capturing that authentic Lodigiano flavor is a special treat. You end up with a snack that's crispy at the edges, chewy in the middle. And the flavors? Super, super good.
Across northern Italy, this kind of savory puff pastry recipe is a hit at parties, for quick lunches, or just chilling with friends. It’s the type of food you'd find at local events—way better than boring old breadsticks. Plus, the combo of olives and tangy onions gives it this Mediterranean vibe. The cheese on top? Ties it all together beautifully. Some folks even throw in rosemary or try different onions to mix it up, but the heart's always that balance—moist and sweet onions, salty cheese, and the olives’ bite.
This is one of those vegetarian tart recipes that really hits the mark. Easy to eat with your hands, kinda rustic, and seriously delicious. For real. If you're hunting for easy appetizer recipes with that Italian flair, this savory pastry is a top choice. Whether you're serving a crowd or just treating yourself, it’s the perfect pick. It’s one of those go-to snacks, bringing a little piece of Lombardy right to your table. And here's the thing: it’s really, really good.
To prepare the olive puff pastries with caramelized onions, start by caramelizing the onions: melt the butter in a pan over low heat , add the onions and let them brown for a few minutes , then add the granulated sugar . Stir occasionally with a wooden spoon, being careful not to let the sugar stick to the bottom of the pan;
while the sugar melts, enhance the onions by adding the soy sauce . Let it cook over moderate heat for about 20 minutes, or until the onions are well caramelized (stirring occasionally) . At this point, you are ready to assemble your finger food: take the olive pastries
and place a few flakes of Raspadura and a couple of still-warm caramelized onions on each . Finally, garnish everything with a sprig of chives . The olive puff pastries with caramelized onions are ready to be served!
We recommend consuming the olive puff pastries with caramelized onions as soon as they are ready, but if you wish, you can store them in the refrigerator, sealed in an airtight container, for a maximum of one day, or they will lose their crunchiness.
If you cannot find Raspadura, you can also garnish the pastries with parmesan flakes, on which you will place the caramelized onions as per the recipe.
