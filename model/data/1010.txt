instructions:
To prepare the raspberry jam, make sure you have sanitized the jars you will be using, following the instructions at the end of the recipe. Wash the raspberries well under running water. Then let them drain in a colander and place them in a baking dish. Squeeze the lemon juice, strain it, and drizzle it over the raspberries , add the sugar , and mix well.
Cover with plastic wrap and let the raspberries macerate for at least 4 hours in the refrigerator (or better yet, overnight). After this time, retrieve the mixture and transfer it to a pot .
Start cooking the jam and skim it as soon as necessary with a skimmer . The jam typically needs to cook for about 50-60 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally. The jam is ready if, when you drop a bit on a saucer and tilt it, it remains stable and doesn't run. If you prefer to remove the raspberry seeds, pass the jam through a sieve or food mill. Then proceed to pour the still-hot raspberry jam into the sanitized jars , being careful to leave 0.4 inches from the jar's edge. Lightly tap the containers on a surface to settle the plum and ginger jam. Close the jars and let them cool. If you use jars with rubber seal closures, you can test the vacuum by pulling the tab: if pulling it produces a sharp noise, it means the content has been properly vacuum-sealed. On the contrary, if pulling the tab the seal feels "soft," it means the vacuum wasn't created correctly, and it's better not to consume the content. If you use jars with screw caps, after inserting the hot jam, screw the lids on well, but not too tightly, and let the jars cool. You can turn them upside down or skip this step: the heat will create a vacuum anyway, which will allow the product to preserve for a long time. Once the jars have cooled, check if the vacuum has formed correctly: you can press the center of the cap, and if you don't hear the classic "click-clack," the vacuum has occurred. Once you have verified that the storage was successful, your raspberry jam is ready to be stored in the pantry!
Homemade raspberry jam lasts about 3 months in a dark, dry place if the jars were sterilized correctly and if a vacuum was created. Once opened, store in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.
Always remember that the jam should not harden completely during cooking. The compote, in fact, achieves a firmer consistency as it cools, so if you cook it too much, you risk getting a jam that's too hard.
The homemade preparation of preserves and jams can pose health risks. In a home environment, it is not possible to create the conditions and measures necessary to ensure the safety and suitability of foods, which, on the contrary, industrial procedures are able to assure to prevent dangerous contaminations. It is therefore important to scrupulously follow food safety guidelines to reduce risks, but always keep in mind that the same food safety as professionally produced preserves and jams cannot be achieved. For proper preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
