When the ingredients are combined, first incorporate the salt and then the oil slowly . Finish the kneading phase on the work surface until the oil is completely absorbed .
Create a smooth and homogeneous sphere and place it in an oiled bowl, covering it with plastic wrap . Let it rise for about 2 hours, or until the dough has doubled, under a wool blanket or at a constant temperature of 79-82°F .
In the meantime, cut the cheese and salami into cubes about 0.2 inches each. Lastly, clean the zucchini flowers by cutting the base .
When the dough has risen, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and roll it out with a rolling pin to obtain a rectangle about 27.5 inches long and 11.8 inches wide . Sprinkle with a little pepper .
Leave a couple of centimeters from the edges and pour the cheese and salami cubes in the middle , finally open the zucchini flowers in half and cover the dough .
Close the short side over itself from one side and the other and start rolling the long side .
You'll get a nice thick roll and then roll it up to form a snail shape . Transfer to a 9-inch mold with parchment paper at the base and greased around the circumference . Cover with a clean cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
After the time has passed, brush the surface with mixed egg yolk and a splash of milk , sprinkle with poppy seeds, and proceed with baking : the savory pie with salami and zucchini flowers bakes in a static oven, already hot at 356°F, for about 45 minutes. Enjoy it warm.
