Cut the cod fillets into pieces . In a pan, heat the oil and place the cod . Cook over medium-high heat for 2 minutes, then season with salt and pepper .
Carefully turn the fish fillets and deglaze with about 1 cup of citrus juice . Add a few marjoram leaves and cook for 7-8 minutes.
Finally, add the balsamic vinegar , the citrus zest and let it flavor for a moment. Plate and garnish with a few marjoram leaves. Your citrus cod is ready to be enjoyed warm !
It's recommended to consume the cod with citrus as soon as it's ready; if necessary, you can store it in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 2 days.
You can vary the type of citrus to create new combinations!
Instead of cod, you can use other white and delicate fish like croaker, hake, or sea bass, adjusting the cooking times based on the thickness of the fillets or pieces.
If you wish, you can enrich the dish by adding Taggiasca olives, desalted capers, or toasted pine nuts.
