instructions:
To prepare the salmon trout with orange, start by cleaning the trout: make a lengthwise cut on the lower part of the fish and remove the entrails, then rinse it well under running water and dry it (1-2). Sprinkle the trout's flesh with salt and
season it with chopped parsley and a piece of butter . Then take a baking dish and oil it . Place the two stuffed salmon trout inside and season them with salt and pepper on the outside as well .
Bake the two trout at 350°F for about half an hour: during cooking, occasionally move the baking dish to loosen the fish from the bottom (without touching it) and baste it with the released cooking juices . Five minutes before the end of cooking, squeeze the juice of an orange and pour it over the trout . Finish cooking in the oven, and once ready, remove the trout and place them on a serving platter.
Collect the cooking juices from the trout in a small saucepan and add a few tablespoons of cream . Let the sauce reduce over very low heat for a few minutes, adjust seasoning with salt if necessary, and once ready, pour it into a gravy boat. Serve your salmon trout with orange along with the accompanying sauce!
Salmon trout with orange can be stored in the refrigerator, sealed tightly in an airtight container, for 1 day.
If you want to make the accompanying sauce thicker, add a tablespoon of flour dissolved in a little water. You can garnish the serving dish of this dish with an orange, peeling the fruit and removing the white membrane, then slicing it thinly and cutting the slices in half, arranging them along the entire edge of the plate. You can also use the fruit peel, using a tool called a zester, to create very aromatic and elegant-looking strands to place on top of the fish as decoration.
The salmon trout owes its name to the particularly pink color of its flesh, which resembles that of salmon; the pink color depends on what the trout eats, especially crustaceans or meals made from them, and in fish farms, great importance is placed on its diet to achieve this particular coloration.
