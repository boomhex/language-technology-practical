instructions:
To prepare the sushi rice at home, first rinse the nishiki rice thoroughly in cold water to remove impurities. You will need to change the water until it becomes clear. Then soak it for an hour. Drain it and let it rest in a colander placed over another bowl for 5 minutes . In a high-sided pot, pour 17.6 oz of water .
Add the cleaned rice . Usually, the rice-water ratio is 1:1, but it may vary depending on the season: less is needed in fall, more in spring. Turn on the heat and cover the pot with a lid: we used a wooden one , but alternatively, you can use a regular one. When it starts to boil, stir the rice once with a wooden spoon for even cooking. Cook on medium heat for 5 minutes, then reduce the heat and cook for another 7 minutes on low.
At this point, remove the pot from the heat without removing the lid and let it rest for another 6 minutes. Then return the pot to the heat on medium-high for another 30 seconds . The consistency should be slightly al dente. Then turn it off. Prepare the rice vinegar mixture, which will give a slightly tangy taste. In a small saucepan, pour the rice vinegar and add the salt . Heat on medium-low to dissolve the salt until it reaches a boil .
Then add the sugar , stir , and turn off the heat. Let cool and add the kombu seaweed . A tip is to wash the kombu seaweed before adding it to the mixture to remove the white coating sometimes present on the outside and reduce the salty intake.
Now that the rice is ready, take the hangiri (or alternatively a low and wide wooden container or another material that isn't steel), used to season the rice. Wet it with water and then empty it: this way the wood won't absorb the vinegar. Pour the rice inside
and add the filtered vinegar mixture, letting it drip on the spoon to spread it over the rice . Stir the rice by moving it gently so as not to crush it . It's important to stir until it appears shiny and well-seasoned. To cool it, fan it so the vinegar evaporates quickly.
Once seasoned, transfer the rice to the ohitsu , the wooden container to maintain the rice temperature. Cover it with a damp paper towel to keep the heat constant . Alternatively, you can use a wooden or steel container covered with a damp cloth. When the rice is at about 97°F, you can use and serve it for your sushi .

The fish must be extremely fresh and frozen. Follow the health guidelines for safe consumption.
Sushi should be made and served immediately . Any form of preservation is not recommended.
The choice of rice is crucial for sushi preparation: we used rice grown in Lombardy using the Japanese method with a grain that undergoes 20% polishing for a rounder taste. At home, you can use nishiki rice.
In autumn , using freshly harvested rice, you can use water at 85% of the rice weight for cooking; in spring , more water is needed (about 90% of the rice weight) because it contains less moisture.
We do not recommend replacing rice vinegar as it gives sushi rice its characteristic flavor.
Sushi rice can be prepared in advance : it can also be reheated in the microwave before use. The important thing is that it maintains a temperature equal to body temperature, about 97°F.


The essential tools for making artful sushi are:
_Special knives with sharp blades to cut the fish and rolls cleanly.
_Makisu , the mat for making sushi.
_Hangiri , the untreated wooden bowl for seasoning the rice once ready. Any low and very wide container made of any material but not steel can be used.
_Shamoji , the flat and rounded spatula for gently stirring and seasoning the rice. Alternatively, a wooden spoon can be used.
_Fan to cool the rice and quickly evaporate the vinegar.
_Ohitsu , the untreated wooden container where the rice is rested and stored for use. Alternatively, a wooden or steel container can be used, always covered with a damp cloth.

Sushi originated as a preservation method: as early as the 5th century BC, fish was fermented wrapped in rice and salt.
Over the centuries, the technique has been refined more and more, thanks also to the introduction of other ingredients such as rice vinegar, which is still part of the preparation today.
The first sushi bar dates back to the early 1800s when Yohei Hanaya began serving nigiri sushi at his stand, a bite of rice flavored with vinegar topped with a slice of raw fish. Hanaya's merit was drastically reducing the preparation times of traditional sushi, and for this reason, his sushi quickly spread throughout Japan.
