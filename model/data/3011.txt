To prepare the balsamic vinegar chicken breast, start with the marinade: in a bowl put the olive oil , then squeeze the juice of half a lemon, filter it with a fine-mesh strainer, and add it to the oil in the bowl . Then emulsify the ingredients thoroughly with a whisk or fork. Then add the herbs: the rosemary sprigs, thyme
and the bay leaves . Then pour in the balsamic vinegar , the bitter , and emulsify thoroughly.
Now prepare the meat: take the chicken breast and remove the fat filaments (if any), then with a sharp knife start cutting it to obtain slices about 0.5 inches thick . Place the chicken breast slices in the marinade bowl
and moisten them well. Turn the slices to marinate them on the other side as well , then cover with plastic wrap and place them in the fridge for at least an hour. After the necessary time, take a large pan and pour in a drizzle of oil. Brown a clove of garlic and remove it when it is golden.
Place the chicken slices in the pan and brown them well. Then turn them over and continue cooking on the other side . Serve the chicken slices still hot!
