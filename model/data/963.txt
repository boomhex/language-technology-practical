instructions:
To prepare salted chestnuts, first score the base of the shell with a small knife . Place the chestnuts in a bowl, cover with water, and soak for 30 minutes: this will make them easier to peel after cooking . After this time, drain the chestnuts and pat them dry with a dish towel .
Now pour the coarse salt into a pan , distribute the chestnuts on top , and turn the heat to the lowest setting, covering with a lid .
Cook the chestnuts for about 20-25 minutes (the time varies depending on the size), turning them every so often with kitchen tongs . Once they are well roasted , remove the pan from the heat and serve your salted chestnuts hot !
It is recommended to consume salted chestnuts as soon as they are made.
The amount of coarse salt is equivalent to the weight of the chestnuts, so if you want to double the amount of chestnuts, you should also double the amount of coarse salt! Also discover how to prepare Air fryer roasted chestnuts !
