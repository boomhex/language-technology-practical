If you’re curious about how to make multicolor macarons , it's the perfect excuse to experiment with colors and flavors—seriously good—creating something unique that stands out at any party and brings that authentic French dessert vibe right to your home.
To prepare the basic meringue for the macarons, sift the almond flour with the powdered sugar into a bowl , then add half of the egg whites and mix with a spoon to combine the mixture ; incorporate, still stirring, the condensed milk and set the mixture aside.
In a separate small heavy-bottomed pan, add the granulated sugar and water , mix and start heating over low heat; check the syrup temperature with a thermometer until it reaches 250°F . Meanwhile, whip the remaining half of the egg whites (about 2.5 oz) in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment (or with an electric whisk) until stiff peaks form, then lower the whisk speed and slowly pour in the syrup
continuing to whip until the meringue has completely cooled down and has a dense, smooth, and glossy appearance . Add the whipped egg whites to the almond flour and powdered sugar in several additions: start with 1/3 and mix from top to bottom. Add the rest and once everything is incorporated, you can mix vigorously to give the mixture an elastic and glossy structure. Divide the batter into 4 separate bowls and add the different liquid (or powder) food colorings
gradually until you achieve the desired shade . Take a batter and transfer it to a pastry bag with a round tip of 5/16 inches in diameter and form small balls directly onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , let them rest for at least 20 minutes on the baking sheet, the balls will flatten slightly on their own and become perfectly smooth on the surface .
Bake one tray at a time in a preheated convection oven at 320°F for about 10 minutes (static ovens are not recommended); after that time, leave them in the semi-open oven for another 2 minutes. Remove the macarons' meringues from the oven and let them cool on a rack . Meanwhile, prepare the cream: soften the gelatin by placing it for 5 minutes in a bowl with cold water .
After this time, squeeze it well and add it to 1/4 cup of warm cream , stir with a spoon to combine it. Separately, melt the white chocolate in a bain-marie or in the microwave and then add the cream and gelatin mixture , stirring with a spoon to obtain a smooth sauce .
Meanwhile, whip the fresh cream to stiff peaks and finally add the condensed milk , stirring with a spoon until homogeneous. To finish, gently fold the whipped cream mixture into the chocolate mixture, being careful not to deflate the cream . Transfer the cream into a pastry bag fitted with a round tip .
At this point, you can assemble the macarons: place the white chocolate filling using the pastry bag onto the flat side of the small meringues and cover with the other half very gently ; repeat the same procedure with all the macarons and place them on a serving plate . It's advisable to refrigerate the multicolor macarons overnight before serving.
Store the unfrosted multicolor macarons under a glass dome or in a tin box for 2-3 days. You can store the cream separately in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for a couple of days.
For traditionalists, it's possible to fill the multicolor macarons with classic creams, such as dark chocolate, coffee, and raspberry, to create many delicious flavor combinations.
