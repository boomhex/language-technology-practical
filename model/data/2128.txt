instructions:
Pasta with zucchini cream and scampi is one of those Italian summer dishes that just feels like a breeze straight from the coast. In places like Liguria or along the Amalfi Coast, people love throwing together fresh veggies and seafood for something that's light yet super flavorful. Really good stuff. The magic? This shrimp pasta combines the gentle, slightly bitter zucchini taste—mellowed out into a smooth creamy sauce—with the sweetness of scampi. And then, it starts to taste pretty special.
The scampi don’t go in plain. Oh no. They get a quick splash of brandy while cooking, which brings out an aromatic punch that blends with the sauce beautifully. And look, with the green from the zucchini and the pink from the shrimp, this dish looks like a little summer celebration on your plate. Eating it on a sunny evening with a glass of chilled white wine really brings out those Mediterranean vibes. So good.
In Italy, folks get pretty serious about using super fresh, seasonal stuff. That's what makes this zucchini cream sauce and seafood combo stand out. I mean, the zucchini turns silky when pureed and wraps every bite of pasta in a delicate, light flavor that lets the seafood shine. For sure. You get that classic taste from a scampi pasta recipe —it’s rich without being heavy and always a bit moist from the sauce.
Some regional takes might use tagliolini or spaghetti for this, but really, any long pasta works. The dish is definitely fancier than your usual weeknight dinner, but honestly, it’s still easy enough to pull off. Perfect for impressing someone or just treating yourself. Most people pair it with a crisp white wine, making every bite taste extra fresh and cool, the way seafood pasta recipes are meant to be enjoyed when the weather’s warm. It’s one of those meals that’s both tender and refreshing, hitting all the right notes for anyone who loves Italian food and simple summer cooking. Whether you are by the sea or just dreaming of it, this dish brings a bit of Italy right to your table. Pretty much.
To prepare the pasta with zucchini cream and shrimp, start by cleaning the shrimp: use scissors to cut the shell to easily remove the carapace , remove the head
Then use kitchen tweezers to gently extract the intestine, or the black filament found on the back , set aside the cleaned shrimp and their scraps, which will be used to prepare the stock. Then prepare the fish stock: in a pan, heat 25 grams (about 2 tbsp) of olive oil with a clove of garlic peeled and halved, add the peeled and sliced carrot and then pour in the heads and shells of the cleaned shrimp , sauté everything for 5 minutes.
Cover the fish scraps with water , add the peppercorns and parsley stems . Cook over moderate heat for at least 20 minutes.
Once cooked, strain the stock through a sieve , set it aside, it will be used for cooking the pasta. Wash and trim the zucchini then slice them thinly . In a pan, heat about 25 grams (about 2 tbsp) of olive oil, then add the chopped shallot and sauté for 5 minutes,
add a scant ladle of stock and incorporate the zucchini slices . Cook for 10-12 minutes, adding stock as needed to prevent the zucchini from drying out,
when cooked turn off the heat and take ¾ of the zucchini place them in a blender cup and blend with an immersion blender to obtain the cream .
Meanwhile, bring the stock to a boil, cook the pasta in it for 9 minutes or as long as needed to be al dente salt as necessary considering the stock will flavor the pasta. While the pasta is cooking, heat 30 grams (about 2 tbsp) of olive oil in a pan with a peeled and halved clove of garlic , add the cleaned shrimp
deglaze with brandy and let it evaporate, cook the shrimp for 3-4 minutes at most. When the pasta is al dente, drain it and put it back in the pan where you cooked the zucchini , add the zucchini cream and mix to flavor it.
Then add the zucchini slices and the shrimp , finally chop the parsley leaves to add to the pasta, mix everything and serve the pasta with zucchini cream and shrimp hot .
It is recommended to consume the pasta with zucchini cream and shrimp immediately. If there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator in an airtight container for one day at most. Freezing is not recommended.
As an alternative to shrimp, you can also use prawns. If you don't like the aroma of brandy, you can deglaze the shrimp with dry white wine.
