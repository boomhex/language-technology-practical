instructions:
To prepare the carrots with milk, wash and peel the carrots , then slice them into rounds about 1/8 inch thick .
Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a wide, shallow pan, then add the flour , stir, and then add the milk and the water ,
nutmeg and salt : mix well with a whisk to avoid forming lumps and as soon as the liquid in the pan starts to boil, add the sliced carrots . Let the carrots with milk cook gently until they are tender but not mushy, and the cooking liquid has thickened and reduced significantly . Before finishing cooking, adjust the salt if necessary and then serve the carrots with milk hot and creamy. If you like, you can sprinkle them with chopped parsley, or (if not serving to children) dust them with white pepper.
Store the carrots with milk in the refrigerator, sealed in an airtight container, for a couple of days at most.
If everyone around the table is over fifteen, I recommend the adult version, flavored with some spices or a blend of aromatic herbs (such as chives or, even better, thyme). If, instead, you simply want to enrich the dish or offer a variant, you can sprinkle it with grated Parmesan or add some tender peas.
