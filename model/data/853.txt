instructions:
To make the risotto with baby spinach pesto, start with the cherry tomatoes: after washing them, cut them in half and place them on a baking tray, season them with oil , salt, powdered sugar ,
oregano and grated lemon zest . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F (200°C) for 30 minutes. In the meantime, boil the rice in salted water for 10 minutes or as indicated on the package.
Drain the rice and set it aside in a bowl with a drizzle of oil to prevent it from sticking . Now focus on the pesto. Put the baby spinach, almonds ,
cold water , Parmesan cheese , salt ,
oil , pepper in a tall and narrow container and blend everything with a hand blender . When the pesto is smooth, it will be ready; set it aside .
Drain the chickpeas and cut the quartirolo cheese into approximately 1/2-inch (1.3cm) cubes . Meanwhile, your cherry tomatoes will be cooked; take them out of the oven .
It's time to dress the rice. Put it in a large bowl and add the baby spinach pesto , give it a good stir, and if necessary, add a drizzle of oil. Add the chickpeas , confit cherry tomatoes, and quartirolo cheese
and the seed mix . Mix everything and your risotto with baby spinach pesto will be ready to be served .
The risotto with baby spinach pesto can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can replace the powdered sugar with brown sugar. Alternatively, you can use tofu or fresh cheese instead of quartirolo cheese.
