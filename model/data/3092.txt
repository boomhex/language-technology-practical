So, these whoopie pies are pretty much the best thing to happen when you mix some fun American dessert ideas with a twist from the kitchen. I mean, what you get with these Nesquik whoopie pies is a bunch of super soft, cake-like sandwiches that are almost moist and super light. Really, when you bite in—oh man, they’re good. The batter uses yogurt and a hefty scoop of Nesquik, so you end up with a chocolatey taste that's not too heavy. Makes the mini cakes extra tender.
The great part? You can fill them with just about anything, but the stracciatella filling here is where things get seriously exciting. That creamy center mixes whipped cream and condensed milk with tiny chocolate chips, so every bite is a mix of creamy and a little bit crispy from the chips. Really really good stuff. It’s the kind of treat that feels just as right for a birthday table as it does for an afternoon snack.
For folks who like to mix things up, these Nesquik whoopie pies are a winner. They show up at parties or family hangouts and—boom—always disappear fast, thanks to the combo of sweet cake and that cool, rich stracciatella filling . Kids usually go straight for the chocolate bits, while adults like how the filling isn't too heavy but still feels super indulgent. These are the sort of chocolate whoopie pies that really get people talking. Not hard to make your own with different fillings, but this version with the stracciatella cream kind of steals the show. Seriously, it does.
Everyone likes how easy they are to pick up and eat—no forks or plates needed, which is great. It’s really the kind of snack that works any time, whether you’re packing lunchboxes or putting something special out for a weekend crowd. Plus, being a classic from the world of American desserts —and look—they’ve got that cool, relaxed vibe that makes them fit right in anywhere. You get all the good stuff: soft mini cakes, a creamy middle, and a little chocolate surprise every time you take a bite. There’s not much better than that when you just want something tasty and fun, for real!
To prepare Nesquik whoopies with stracciatella cream, first prepare the cakes: mix the Nesquik and sifted flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt in a bowl and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with beaters, or alternatively, you can use an electric mixer, place the butter which should be at room temperature and the sugar , beat for a few minutes then add the egg ,
pour the yogurt while continuing to beat , when it has been absorbed into the mixture, also add the sifted Nesquik and flour and mix everything . Then add the dark chocolate that you have previously melted in the microwave and beat again to combine everything
until you get a homogeneous mixture . Put the obtained mixture in a piping bag with a smooth nozzle with a diameter of 0.8 inches. Squeeze out mounds of the mixture about 1.6 inches in diameter on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper (you should get quite high semi-spheres) for a total of about 15 mounds per baking sheet . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 13-14 minutes (320°F for 10 minutes in a fan oven), then remove the whoopies from the oven and transfer them to a wire rack . Let the whoopies cool.
In the meantime, you can prepare the stracciatella cream. Soak the gelatin in cold water for 10 minutes , then squeeze it and dissolve it in 1.8 oz of cream that you have heated in the microwave . In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with beaters, place the Nestlé condensed milk at room temperature ,
the warm cream in which you dissolved the gelatin , the vanillin , and the honey
and let the beaters run for 5 minutes . Then transfer the cream to a small bowl and cover it with plastic wrap and let it cool in the refrigerator for 5 minutes until it reaches the same temperature as the cream that you will whip later. This step is crucial to avoid creating lumps in the cream. Take the cold cream and whip it with a stand mixer fitted with beaters, or with an electric mixer
once whipped, add it to the previously prepared and cooled mixture , mixing it by rotating a rubber spatula from bottom to top to not deflate the cream. Chop the chocolate chips with a knife and add them to the cream, stirring to combine well .
Now it's time to assemble the Nesquik whoopies, transfer the stracciatella cream to a disposable piping bag with the tip cut off , or fitted with a smooth nozzle, and squeeze the cream onto the flat side of the cake and cover with the flat side of another cake . Continue this way until you finish the ingredients. Here are your delicious Nesquik whoopies with stracciatella cream ready to be devoured !
You can store Nesquik whoopies with stracciatella cream in the refrigerator for 2-3 days in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
