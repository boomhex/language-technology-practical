instructions:
To prepare Neapolitan zeppole, first prepare the Pastry cream ; you will need about 2 cups of it. Now prepare the dough. Pour the water into a pot and add the salt . Add the butter and stir continuously until it is melted . It should almost reach boiling point.
Add all the flour at once , lower the heat to the minimum, and stir with a wooden spoon for about 5 minutes. When the dough detaches well from the walls and a patina forms on the bottom, you can turn off the heat and transfer it to a bowl. While the dough is still warm, add one egg .
Stir with a wooden spoon to absorb it , then continue this way, adding one egg at a time and stirring until you get a creamy yet firm mixture . You may need to add an extra egg if the eggs are very small, so adjust according to the consistency.
Now transfer the dough into a piping bag with a 0.6-inch star nozzle . Grease a baking sheet and create the zeppole within it using the piping bag. Make two circles, trying to achieve a diameter of 4 inches, and ensure the zeppole are well spaced, as they will grow while baking . Bake the zeppole in a preheated static oven at 392°F until they have grown; it will take about 15-18 minutes. Meanwhile, pour plenty of oil into a saucepan and heat it to reach a temperature of 356°F. Then remove the zeppole from the oven .
Fry them immediately in the hot oil to prevent them from deflating . Turn them over often using the handles of two wooden spoons, and after about 2 minutes, when they are golden, you can drain them . We recommend cooking 2 or 4 zeppole at a time if you have a large enough pan. Then drain the zeppole with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a tray with absorbent paper to remove excess oil.
As soon as the zeppole are cold, sprinkle them with powdered sugar , add plenty of custard in the center , and garnish with syrupy cherries .
We recommend consuming the zeppole within 1-2 days at most.
For baking, it is preferable to grease the baking sheet rather than using parchment paper. This way, the zeppole will rise better.
