Pavlova is one of those desserts that really brings a bit of drama to the table. You know, straight from Australia and New Zealand , this pavlova recipe stands out with its mix of a crisp outer shell and that soft, tender inside. What makes this treat super special is the way you build it—stacking up a base of delicate meringue with a generous layer of chantilly cream . The best part? The finishing touch: a bright, tangy coulis of wild berries poured over the top, plus a handful of fresh berries for a pop of color and taste. People love the play of textures here—there’s the crunchy outside, the moist marshmallow center, and all that cream and fruit.

Throughout Australia and New Zealand , this berry pavlova often shows up at celebrations and special dinners. While folks sometimes swap in different fruit, the pavlova with berries and whipped cream remains a classic.

Once cooled, you top it with clouds of chantilly, spoon over cold berry sauce, and scatter on some fresh berries. It’s a dessert that always draws a crowd, partly because it just looks so elegant, but mostly because it tastes so so fresh and sweet. Those little details—piping the meringue, chilling the fruit, getting the cream extra light—make a big difference. With this pavlova cake , you get something that works for both casual get-togethers and more dressed-up meals. It's easy to see why pavlova with whipped cream and fruit is a favorite for people who want to end their night with a little style and a lot of flavor. Whether you're enjoying it on a sunny afternoon or at a festive evening gathering, pavlova offers a great combination of textures and tastes that feels both indulgent and refreshing. Really good stuff.
To prepare the pavlova with chantilly cream and berries, start with making the meringue shells. In a double boiler, work the egg whites with 150 g of granulated sugar , stirring with a whisk by hand until they reach 113°F. Remove from heat, add the remaining 150 g of sugar, and beat with electric whisks . Then add the shredded coconut and mix with a spatula from top to bottom.
Once completed, place the mixture in a pastry bag . Take a baking tray, line it with parchment paper, place the rings also lined with parchment paper, and distribute the meringue to create the bases and the edges, forming a shell . Bake in a preheated static oven at 203°F for 8 hours: the baking is gentle and long because the meringue needs to dry gradually. Meanwhile, prepare the chantilly cream by working the fresh liquid cream with vanilla syrup and powdered sugar until it is well whipped.
Also prepare the cold berry coulis by blending the berries with lemon juice and powdered sugar .
Pass the obtained puree through a fine sieve to make it smooth . You can assemble your pavlova: on the serving plates place the meringue shell, the chantilly cream in the center , and decorate with berries .

Top with berry sauce and powdered sugar as desired . Enjoy the pavlova with chantilly cream and berries as a delicious dessert !
