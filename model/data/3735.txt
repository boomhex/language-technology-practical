To prepare the chocolate eggs filled with pear mousse, start by peeling the pears and removing the core , cut them into cubes and place them in a saucepan where you will add the Moscato wine and the sugar . Cook the pears and let the wine evaporate. Meanwhile, soak the gelatin sheets in plenty of cold water for 10 minutes.
When the pears are cooked, puree them in a blender while still warm, adding a sprinkle of cinnamon powder if you like . You should obtain a smooth and lump-free puree; if necessary, pass the cream through a sieve. Squeeze the gelatin and dissolve it in the still warm pear puree, then place the puree in the refrigerator for about half an hour. Meanwhile, divide the chocolate eggs in half using a knife with a smooth and thin blade, slightly heated over a flame, to cut along the existing seam line .
Melt the dark chocolate in a double boiler or microwave and brush the edges of the eggs , then dip them in the chopped hazelnuts and let them harden in a cool place. Place the remaining melted chocolate in a piping bag and draw 8 shapes (bows, hearts, pinwheels) on parchment paper, which you will cool in the refrigerator .
Whip the cream and gently fold it into the previously prepared pear puree . Place the mousse in the refrigerator and let it cool for at least half an hour. With the mousse well chilled, fill the 8 half eggs and finally position a chocolate decoration on the top of each . Serve the chocolate eggs filled with mousse well chilled.
It is advisable to serve two mousse-filled eggs per person, given the small size of the chocolate shells. Alternatively, you could also prepare or purchase slightly larger chocolate eggs and serve just one per person.
