Golden color and creamy texture make mimosa risotto a favorite at many family tables, especially when everyone wants something that looks as beautiful as it tastes. The bright yellow hue from saffron in this creamy risotto brings a cheerful feeling—perfect for those International Women’s Day recipes or really any time you want to make an ordinary meal feel special. Home cooks usually appreciate how reliably this saffron risotto turns out with just the right soft , sweet notes and that pleasant aroma everyone notices even before the first bite. The appearance stays nice no matter the serving: a pop of golden color, a hint of moist richness, and, thanks to Arborio rice , every spoonful delivers that familiar rich body. Even picky eaters like the mix of Parmesan cheese and just enough subtle saffron to make things interesting without going overboard.
Busy families like knowing this risotto recipe fits lots of different occasions, whether you’re making it for Sunday dinner, early spring celebrations, or last-minute cozy evenings at home—it just works. Adding smashed boiled eggs on top for a little whimsy…kids and guests love the color and new textures, so it’s almost always worth trying something different with mimosa risotto (especially with a dash of extra Parmesan cheese ). With vegetable broth, it can work for everyone at the table, even those who don’t eat meat. Goes with simple salads or as a DELICIOUS side with light proteins, so you get real flexibility and don’t have to stress about fussy pairings. Since risotto classics like this often get requested over and over, it’s nice to see families smiling and asking for seconds. Great for serving at friendly gatherings, busy weeknights, or just anytime you want a dish that feels a little extra special—but still comforting, family-friendly, and EASY to love. Try it once and pretty much everyone will agree…it’s a keeper for all sorts of meals.
To prepare mimosa risotto, start by thoroughly cleaning the asparagus (click here for the procedure) and immerse them in a pot of lightly salted boiling water for 5-10 minutes (depending on the size of the asparagus). Drain the asparagus, cut off the tips, which you will set aside whole, and blend the remaining soft green part ; Meanwhile, in a pan, sauté the shallot with half a cup of extra virgin olive oil .
Add the rice to the shallot and toast it over high heat, then pour in the glass of white wine , letting it evaporate well. Add the asparagus cream .
Gradually add a ladle of broth to the rice each time it starts to dry out too much. A few moments before the end of cooking, add the stracchino cheese, allowing it to blend well with the rice, then remove from the heat and stir the risotto with butter and Grana Padano cheese , seasoning with pepper and adjusting the salt if necessary. Place the rice on a serving plate and complete the presentation by decorating your mimosa risotto with the asparagus tips set aside earlier and crumbling (using a vegetable mill or a garlic press) the hard-boiled egg yolk in the center of the plate .
If you have one at home, we recommend passing the egg yolks through a potato masher or a vegetable mill, you will achieve a sure mimosa effect.
The Mimosa Risotto, like all other risottos with a similar preparation, should cook in the pan, they should not boil; to obtain a crunchy and tasty rice, the broth should be added gradually, allowing the rice time to absorb the liquid without boiling.
