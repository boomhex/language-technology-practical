instructions:
To prepare the risotto with savoy cabbage and potatoes, start with the cabbage. After removing the stalk, cut it into 1.25-inch pieces . Then move on to the potatoes, peel them and cut into 0.5-inch cubes .
Finally, remove the rind from the Valtellina Casera cheese and cut into cubes of about 0.5 inches . Now move to the stove. In a pot of boiling salted water, pour the brown rice ,
along with the potato cubes and the cabbage pieces . Cook for 15 minutes, drain, and set aside .
In the meantime, prepare the seasoning. Crush an unpeeled garlic clove and throw it into a small pan with the butter and sage . Let it heat over low heat until the butter is melted and aromatic . Now that everything is ready, drizzle some oil in a pan and pour in the rice with potatoes and cabbage .
Heat over low heat, adding the Valtellina Casera cubes , the grated Grana Padano PDO cheese , and the butter seasoning (from which you will have removed the garlic) . Mix everything well, remove the pot from the heat, and serve your risotto with savoy cabbage and potatoes, garnishing with fresh sage leaves .
The risotto with savoy cabbage and potatoes can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
So delicious that it's almost impossible to give an extra touch of prestige to this wonderful risotto with savoy cabbage and potatoes. However, you could try adding some nuts, like chopped and toasted hazelnuts. Or how about adding some speck or sausage to make it an even more complete dish? Finally, if you want to reduce the fat content a bit, you can add some of the aromatic butter to the pan instead of oil.
