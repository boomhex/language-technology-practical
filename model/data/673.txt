To prepare the spinach crepes, first melt the butter (in the microwave or gently in a saucepan) and let it cool. Pour the baby spinach into a tall, narrow container. Add the milk , the now cool melted butter , and the eggs .
Add a pinch of salt and blend everything with an immersion mixer until you get a rather liquid mixture. Add the flour and blend again until you have a smooth batter without lumps.
Grease a 9-inch crepe pan with a little butter and heat it well over the fire. Pour a ladle of the mixture into the center and rotate the pan to cover the entire surface . Cook for about 3 minutes, then as soon as it detaches from the edges, flip the crepe and cook for another minute. Transfer it to a plate and continue cooking the others, greasing the pan with a little butter each time. Your spinach crepes are ready .
Spinach crepes can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Alternatively, you can freeze them.
If you prefer to use regular spinach, we recommend blanching them for a few minutes and squeezing them well before adding them to the batter.
