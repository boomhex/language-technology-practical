instructions:
To prepare the Gnocchi from Val Varaita, first boil the potatoes for 30-40 minutes until they are soft. Test their doneness by piercing with a fork . Pass the hot boiled potatoes through a potato ricer , then spread them out on the work surface. Add the Parmigiano Reggiano DOP .
Grated toma cheese , salt , and the egg .
Start kneading while gradually adding the flour . You should obtain a soft but non-sticky dough .
Shape the dough into logs , then cut into pieces of about 0.6 inches , and form them into the classic shape of ravioles .
As you form them, place them on a cloth sprinkled with semolina . Cut the Raschera DOP into cubes of about 0.4 inches .
Now, make the sauce: melt the butter in a pan until it becomes brown and takes on a nice amber color. Add the Raschera , stir for about thirty seconds, and then add the cream .
Cook on low heat until the cheese is melted . Then, boil the gnocchi in salted water , and as soon as they float, drain them directly into the sauce , allowing them to absorb the flavors in the pan for another minute.
Add cooking water if necessary and stir . Meanwhile, prepare the brown butter: heat the butter on low heat .
Heat gently until the butter reaches an amber color and serve immediately on the plates with a sprinkle of Raschera and brown butter to taste .
It's recommended to consume the Gnocchi from Val Varaita immediately.
Raschera is a mixed semi-hard cheese typical of the Cuneo area. To make brown butter, melt the butter in a saucepan on low heat until it reaches an amber color.
