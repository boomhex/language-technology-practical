instructions:
To make the one-pot rice, first prepare a light Vegetable broth and keep it warm. Cube the cooked ham . Remove the outer leaves of the leek, eliminate the base, and slice it thinly . Wash, trim, and slice the zucchini into rounds .
Clean the zucchini flowers by removing the stem and the internal pistil : you will get about 80g (2.8 oz). In a large pan, pour a drizzle of oil and sauté the ham cubes .
Add the leek , let it brown, and then cook for about 2 minutes with half a ladle of vegetable broth . Add the zucchini ,
the zucchini flowers , and the arugula, previously washed and dried . Finally, add the rice .
Cover the rice with broth, salt , pepper, and cook over low heat with the lid on for about 10 minutes . Once the broth is absorbed, uncover, add more broth , and cook for another 10 minutes over low heat.
Once the rice is cooked, flavor the dish with coarsely chopped mint leaves and grated lemon zest . Serve the one-pot rice directly in the pan !
Store the one-pot rice in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap and consume it within 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can make this one-pot with your preferred seasonal vegetables and try adding powdered saffron for a more vibrant color note.
