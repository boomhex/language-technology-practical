instructions:
To prepare eggs and peas, first clean and finely chop the onion . Pour a drizzle of oil into a saucepan and add the onion .
Let the onion soften over a low heat for a few minutes , stirring occasionally, then add the peas and season with salt and pepper . Cook for about 10 minutes over low heat, stirring occasionally.
At this point, gently break the eggs into the pan with the peas, taking care to keep them whole . Cook until you reach the desired degree of doneness: if you prefer a runny yolk, 5 minutes without the lid will suffice, until the egg white turns white. If you prefer the yolk to be firm, then cook for about 10 minutes with the lid on. Finally, season with another pinch of salt and pepper to taste: serve your eggs and peas hot !
It is recommended to consume immediately.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you want the egg white well cooked and the yolk soft, separate the egg whites from the yolks and pour in the egg whites first; once cooked, add the yolks and cook for a minute. You can add a few mint leaves to give a touch of freshness!
