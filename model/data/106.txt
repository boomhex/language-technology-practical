instructions:
To prepare the banana and blueberry loaf cake, start with the bananas, preferably very ripe: peel them and cut 13 oz of pulp into rough pieces , then transfer it to a bowl. Add the lemon zest and the squeezed and filtered juice .
Use a fork to mash until smooth . In a separate bowl, combine the eggs and sugar , then beat with an electric mixer for about ten minutes. When the mixture is fluffy and frothy, slowly pour in the vegetable oil while keeping the mixer on .
Once the oil is fully absorbed, incorporate the puree , then sift in the flour and baking powder .
Add the baking soda and mix briefly with the mixer, just enough to combine everything . Finally, add the blueberries .
Gently fold them in with a spatula to incorporate evenly. Grease and flour a 9x3 inch loaf pan, then fill it with the batter . Smooth the surface and cut it lengthwise with a greased knife; this will create the typical crack. Bake the loaf cake in a static oven at 340°F for about 70-80 minutes. Check the doneness with a toothpick, then remove from oven and let your banana and blueberry loaf cake cool before slicing and enjoying!
The banana and blueberry loaf cake can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days.
You can substitute granulated sugar with the same amount of brown sugar for a more intense flavor.
If desired, you can further flavor the batter with vanilla extract or enrich it with candied ginger cubes!
