To prepare the radicchio, sausage, and smoked cheese timbale, start with the sausage preparation. Make an incision in the sausage casing and gently pull it outward to remove it . Crumble the sausage with your hands or with a fork, then set it aside in a bowl.
Proceed by washing and drying the rosemary well. Then remove the leaves from the sprig and finely chop them with a knife . Add the fennel seeds .
Chop everything again and set it aside . Proceed with the radicchio, removing the harder white part and slicing it into strips .
Also cut the smoked cheese into not-too-large cubes . Now you have all the ingredients ready for the seasoning. Heat a pot with plenty of salted water to cook the pasta. Then take a non-stick pan and brown a clove of garlic in a drizzle of oil . When it turns golden, remove it .
Add the sausage and sauté it for about 4-5 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally for even cooking . Then season with the aromatic mixture .
Adjust with salt , pepper , and deglaze with white wine . Let it cook by lowering the heat for about 10-15 minutes.
If necessary, add a ladle of pasta cooking water . When the sausage ragù is cooked, turn off the heat and add the radicchio , mixing it with the other ingredients .
The water in the pot will now be boiling, and you can cook the pasta . Drain it still al dente and pour it directly into the pan with the seasoning and combine it with the other ingredients .
When you have combined the ingredients add the smoked cheese cubes and mix again . Set aside while preparing the pan to bake the timbale.
Take a bundt pan of 8.7 inches in diameter and 3.9 inches in height. Grease it , using a brush and sprinkle it with breadcrumbs
Transfer the pasta into the pan . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 20 minutes (if you have a convection oven, at 320°F for 10 minutes). After the cooking time, remove the pan from the oven . Finally, let it rest for a few minutes before unmolding your radicchio, sausage, and smoked cheese timbale onto a serving plate and enjoy it while still warm!
It is possible to store the radicchio, sausage, and smoked cheese timbale for a maximum of 1-2 days in the refrigerator, well covered with plastic wrap.
It is also possible to freeze it, once cooked, only if fresh and not defrosted ingredients have been used.
Do you want to give your sausage ragù an even more intense and rich flavor? Add peas and green beans. For an even tastier timbale, try adding grated Grana cheese before baking!
