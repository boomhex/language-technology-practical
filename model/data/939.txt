instructions:
To make the baked cassata, first drain the ricotta in a colander and leave it in the refrigerator for at least a couple of hours, or even overnight, so that it loses excess liquid. After this time, prepare the filling by placing the sheep ricotta and sugar in a bowl , flavor with the grated zest of half a lemon , and mix well .
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator. Proceed to prepare the shortcrust: in a mixer with steel blades, combine the flour, powdered sugar , and cold butter from the fridge cut into cubes .
Add the grated zest of half a lemon , a pinch of salt , 2 whole eggs, and one yolk .
Pulse to compact the mixture, then transfer the obtained mixture onto the work surface and form it into a dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour. After the resting time for the shortcrust, take back the ricotta cream and add the chocolate chips, then mix well to incorporate them evenly .
Roll out two-thirds of the dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/4 inch and line a 9.5-inch springform pan, including the edges, then prick the base with a fork . Crumble half of the dry biscuits over the base and pour in the ricotta and chocolate chip filling .
Level the ricotta with the back of a spoon and add the other half of crumbled dry biscuits , then remove the excess shortcrust from the edges with a knife .
Now roll out the remaining dough to the same thickness of 1/4 inch . Brush the edges of the shortcrust in the pan with the egg white and cover with the second disc of shortcrust, removing the excess and sealing the edges well with your fingers .
Prick the surface with a fork and bake in a preheated static oven at 338°F for 120 minutes, on the middle shelf. After that, move the pan to the lowest shelf and bake for another 10 minutes. Once cooked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool completely before turning it out onto a serving plate .
Dust with powdered sugar as desired, using a stencil to obtain a pretty lozenge decoration . Your baked cassata is ready to be served !
The baked cassata can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days, making sure to leave it at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving.
Don't worry if the cake tends to puff up during baking: it's normal, as it cools it will deflate and once turned over the surface will be flat!
With leftover shortcrust, you can make delicious cookies: it is not possible to reduce the doses, otherwise it would be difficult to work with.
