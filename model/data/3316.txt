To prepare the Mickey and Minnie whoopie pies, start by whipping the softened butter with sugar using electric beaters. Then add the egg and continue whipping the mixture, also adding honey and the vanilla bean seeds.
Sift the flour with cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and add half of it to the previously prepared mixture , blending it with a wooden spoon; then add half of the warm milk .
Repeat the process with the other half of the flours and the remaining milk. Place the mixture in a piping bag and, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, create mounds of batter about 1.5 inches in diameter, well spaced apart (you can also use a spoon), they will be Mickey and Minnie's face. Above each mound, make two smaller ones (the ears), spacing them about 0.5 inches from the larger one . Bake the treats for 10 minutes at 350°F, after this time remove them from the oven and let them cool.
If you wish to make the decorations, prepare royal icing by whipping 1 egg white and adding 5.3 oz of powdered sugar. Divide the mixture into 3 small bowls, one to leave white, 1 to color red , and 1 yellow using food coloring. Then make Mickey's red shorts with the corresponding yellow buttons and Minnie's bow, red with white polka dots. You should decorate only half of the cakes .
Whip the fresh cream and use it to fill the undecorated halves of the cakes , then cover with the decorated ones , forming delicious sandwiches . Enjoy your meal!
If you can find it, you can replace the granulated sugar and honey with 7 oz of granulated brown sugar, as suggested in the original whoopie pies recipe, it will make your cakes even more irresistible!
