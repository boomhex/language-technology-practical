To make the ricotta and lemon cream pasticciotti, start with the shortcrust pastry: in a mixer, place the sifted flour, a pinch of salt, the butter just taken out of the fridge, the seeds of a vanilla pod, and the powdered sugar . Blend to obtain a sandy mixture, then pour it onto a work surface, create the classic fountain shape and add the egg yolks . Knead everything quickly , just long enough to create a compact and homogeneous dough.
Form a dough ball and flatten it before wrapping it in plastic wrap ; put it in the refrigerator to solidify for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the custard cream: in a saucepan, pour the yolks and work them with the sugar, beating them with a whisk ; then add the sifted cornstarch ,
pour in the milk and cream and place everything over low heat, stirring with a whisk ; thicken the cream by stirring constantly, when it reaches the ideal consistency , turn off the heat and transfer it to a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap on contact and let it cool completely at room temperature and then in the refrigerator.
Sift the ricotta , which you have taken care to drain at least 2 hours before from the excess whey (better still if overnight). When the cream is well chilled, take it and add the ricotta ; mix and also pour in the lemon juice. Cover the cream with plastic wrap and take the shortcrust pastry: roll it out into a sheet about 0.2 inches thick .
Butter and flour the pasticciotti molds, cut out rectangles of pastry and lay them on the molds ; adhere well to the bottom and sides, eliminating the excess dough. Insert 2 teaspoons of cream into each mold , cover with another piece of shortcrust pastry , cut off the excess dough so that the edges are well squared.
Arrange the molds on a baking tray, beat an egg yolk and brush the surface of the pasticciotti . Bake them in a preheated oven at 355°F for 35 minutes (320°F for 25 minutes if using a fan oven). When the pasticciotti are nicely golden , take them out of the oven, let them cool, and enjoy them while still warm !
Store the ricotta and lemon cream pasticciotti in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 days and let them sit for about an hour at room temperature before eating them, or give them a light warm-up. You can freeze the pasticciotti raw, complete with cream, leaving them in their mold and baking them from frozen in the oven at 355°F for 40 minutes. The shortcrust pastry can be frozen wrapped in plastic wrap for about 1 month. You can store the lemon cream in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 1-2 days.
With the leftover egg whites, you can prepare a lemon meringue.
