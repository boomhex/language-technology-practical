instructions:
To prepare the chocolate salami cake, first focus on the base. Heat the milk in a saucepan, then add the butter , sugar , and cocoa .
Stir with a whisk to combine all the ingredients and bring to a boil . Turn off the heat and let it cool. Meanwhile, crumble the biscuits in a bowl to obtain a rustic mixture with not too large crumbs. Coarsely chop the hazelnuts and add them to the bowl .
Also add the now lukewarm milk and cocoa mixture and stir thoroughly to obtain a fairly solid dough .
Pour everything into a 9-inch springform pan lined with parchment paper . Press and level with your hands or a spoon , then place in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. Meanwhile, prepare the glaze by chopping the dark chocolate with a knife and transferring it to a bowl.
Pour the cream into a saucepan and bring to a boil, then add it to the chocolate , stirring with a whisk until it melts . Allow to cool until the glaze has slightly thickened.
Remove the base from the fridge, unmold it and place it on a serving plate. Spread the glaze over the surface of the base , decorate with some chopped hazelnuts , and return to the fridge for at least 1 hour. Your chocolate salami cake is ready to be served !
The chocolate salami cake keeps perfectly in the refrigerator for 4-5 days, well covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container.
For the base, you can use water instead of milk. You can replace the hazelnuts with almonds, pistachios, or pecans. If you don't like hazelnuts, you can omit them or replace them with cereals to maintain the crunchiness.
