instructions:
To prepare sun-dried tomatoes in oil, wash and cut the tomatoes in half lengthwise. Arrange them neatly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and sprinkle them with a little salt, sugar, and a drizzle of oil . Leave them in the static oven at 250°F for 8-10 hours . A baking sheet approximately holds 2 lbs of tomatoes. You can bake two sheets simultaneously, making sure to alternate them during the drying process.
Check them from time to time and remove those that dry faster than others . Once dried, remove them from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack . While the tomatoes are cooling, proceed with the sanitization of the jars and lids, following the guidelines from the Ministry of Health provided at the end of the recipe.
Let the jars dry on a clean cloth . Pack the sun-dried tomatoes in layers, adding a little extra virgin olive oil and pressing them down slightly . Continue layering and finally cover them completely with oil , ensuring to leave about 3/4 inch of space from the jar's rim. If air bubbles form inside, gently move the jar to release them: the oil must distribute evenly in the jar. Place the press to keep the tomatoes in place. If using jars with screw caps, screw them on tightly but not too tight. Proceed with the boiling of the jars, i.e., pasteurization, following the guidelines from the Ministry of Health mentioned at the end of the recipe. If using screw-cap jars, once the jars have cooled, check if the vacuum has formed correctly: press the center of the lid, and if you don't hear the classic "click-clack," the vacuum is successful. If after reboiling you notice the formation of small air bubbles, when the jar is still warm, tap it gently on a surface so the bubbles rise to the top and disappear naturally. If using jars with rubber seal closures, when consuming the sun-dried tomatoes, you can test the vacuum by pulling the tab: if it makes a popping sound, it means the content was preserved with the correct vacuum. Conversely, if the seal feels "soft," it means the vacuum did not form correctly, and it's better not to consume the contents.
Sun-dried tomatoes in oil can be stored for about 3 months, provided the vacuum has formed correctly and the jars are kept in a cool and dry place, away from light and heat sources. It is advisable to wait at least 1 week before consuming the tomatoes. Once a jar is opened, store it in the refrigerator and consume within 3-4 days, ensuring to add extra virgin olive oil to keep the tomatoes covered.
You can flavor the sun-dried tomatoes in oil by adding mint or basil to the jars. The traditional preparation of sun-dried tomatoes in oil involves sun drying; if you have the time and space, you can let them dry in the sun (it will take 7-10 days), turning them occasionally and covering them with a cloth to protect from dust and insects.
Homemade preparation of preserves and jams can pose health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the conditions and measures needed to ensure food safety and suitability, which industrial processes can guarantee to prevent dangerous contamination. It is important to strictly follow food safety guidelines to reduce risks, but it should always be kept in mind that the same food safety level cannot be achieved as with professionally produced preserves and jams. For proper preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the guidelines from the Ministry of Health .
