instructions:
To prepare the tuna amatriciana, first take the fresh tuna and cut it into cubes . In a pan, heat the oil, add the tuna , and let it brown well on all sides for just a few minutes. It should remain very pink in the center. Then transfer it to a small bowl and set it aside.
In the same pan, without adding any more fat, sauté the guanciale until it is golden brown ; it will take about 5 minutes. Transfer this also to another small bowl , trying to drain it from the fat, which should remain inside the pan.
In the same pan with the guanciale fat, add the canned tomatoes and crush them . Lightly salt and let the sauce cook for about 5 minutes. Then add the guanciale .
Also add the tuna cubes and mix . Turn off the heat and throw the bucatini into plenty of lightly salted water .
Cook them until al dente , then drain them, keeping some cooking water aside, and transfer them to the pan with the sauce . Sauté for a few minutes, adding a ladle of water if necessary . Serve the tuna amatriciana with a sprinkle of parsley.
We recommend eating the tuna amatriciana immediately.
Canned tomatoes can be replaced with tomato puree. You can add chili powder or pepper. I do not recommend adding Parmesan due to the presence of fish.
