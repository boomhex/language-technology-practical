instructions:
To prepare u' funnateglie, first peel the onions and slice them . Move on to the peppers, remove the top and the inner seeds .
and cut them into strips . Now cut the cherry tomatoes in half and roughly chop the chili pepper .
In a pan, pour a little oil, add the chili pepper, onion and sauté for a few minutes. When the onion is wilted, add the sausages, without cleaning off the lard in which they were preserved . As soon as the lard has melted, add the cherry tomatoes .
and the peppers . Season with salt , add the basil leaves , and let it cook for 25 minutes on a low heat.
After 25 minutes, if the sauce has reduced too much, add about 2 tablespoons of water and continue cooking for another 15 minutes . At this point, turn off the heat and place the eggs in the empty spaces between the sausage . To be sure not to break them, you can first crack them into a small bowl.
Once you have placed the 4 eggs , cover with a lid and leave like this for about 15 minutes until the egg white is cooked!
Once the eggs have been added, it is recommended to consume immediately. Alternatively, you can prepare the pepper and sausage sauce a few hours before and add the egg after reheating it.
For a tastier variant, try adding grated caciocavallo cheese on top of the eggs; it will melt with the heat and become stringy!
