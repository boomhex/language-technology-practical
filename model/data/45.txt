Seared scallops on a bed of pea puree ? It's like spring on a plate. Really. In northern Italy, especially along the coast, folks just adore dishes that flaunt what's fresh, and this scallop recipe is such a great example. The scallops are seared perfectly—like, super super perfect—keeping them tender on the inside with that golden crust outside. So good.
The sweet seafood bite pairs perfectly with the simple green pea cream underneath. The peas add just a hint of sweet flavor, and then there’s this splash of mint oil—aromatic and bright—that takes it up a notch. Oh, and the crispy prosciutto? Adds a fun salty crunch, contrasting with the soft scallops and smooth puree. And the colors pop—it's just beautiful—with that bright green puree and those slightly browned scallops. Looks as good as it tastes.
In some Italian regions, they love adding little twists—like saffron sauce for some color and earthiness. Or caramelized onions if you’re after something sweeter. And then there’s spinach and Jerusalem artichoke cream for more moist, earthy notes. These versions all keep it simple, focusing on classic scallop cooking techniques that really let the seafood shine.
