Add the onions and stew them over medium heat, then also add the bacon , and let the ingredients slightly wilt, stirring often .
Finely chop the herbs, thyme, and rosemary and mix them with the table salt. In another pan, melt the remaining oil and butter and add the pieces of chicken , sprinkle them with the herb mixture ; pepper and brown the chicken for 5-10 minutes over moderate heat,
turning the chicken pieces from time to time . Pour the onions with the bacon into the pan with the chicken , stir the ingredients a bit and add the beer .
Cover the pan with a lid, being careful to leave a vent and lower the heat to moderate. Let it cook for about 30 minutes, checking from time to time, until the beer is completely absorbed. Add a few bay leaves and when the beer chicken with onions and bacon is well-cooked and browned , serve it immediately!
Store the beer chicken with onions and bacon in the refrigerator, covered, for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
If the chicken you use for this preparation is free-range, you may need to extend the cooking time by a few minutes. In this case, add some hot liquid (broth or water) and continue cooking until the chicken meat is perfectly cooked (check by piercing the meat with the tines of a fork and ensuring no more liquid comes out).
