instructions:
Perch fish risotto? It’s like bringing Lake Como risotto magic right to your table. Really good stuff. Think of it as a delightful mix of Lombardy’s lakeside flavors with that classic Italian rice dish we all love. Around Lecco and Como, perch is a favorite freshwater fish—no question. Local cooks there have totally mastered keeping its tender meat from drying out, letting its mild, slightly sweet taste shine through.
Here's the deal, the base starts with a soffritto—carrots, onions, and celery diced up small and cooked just right to draw out all those moist, savory notes. The rice? It gets toasted, soaking up those veggie flavors before any liquid hits. Introducing some perch early means the rice absorbs that gentle fish flavor. Plus, holding back a few pieces until the end keeps things fresh, letting the fish stay nice and tender.
Not every Italian fish risotto is all about timing, but that’s what makes this one from Lombardy stand out—pretty much. Near the finish, lemon zest pops in, adding a tangy aroma that lifts the dish, making each bite feel light, even with the creamy rice. Locals around the lakes serve perch fish risotto for all sorts of occasions—sometimes a relaxed family lunch, other times dressed up for a fancy dinner.
Unlike some seafood risotto you’ll find by the coast, this traditional risotto recipe from the lakes uses freshwater fish. It’s a more delicate touch, letting those golden grains and subtle veggies shine alongside the mild perch. You might hear it called risotto al pesce persico, and the way it blends gentle flavors with a hint of citrus really really shows what’s special about Lombardy cuisine .
To be honest, this is the kind of dish for anyone who loves refined flavors but craves something creamy and comforting. It’s got just enough elegance for special occasions but fits right in at any table where really good food is enjoyed. So, whether you’re planning a cozy dinner or an elegant gathering, this dish is sure to impress. Seriously good.
To prepare perch fish risotto, start with the fish stock, using the perch fish scraps. Once ready, proceed with the preparation of the sauté. Wash and peel the carrots, onion, and celery, then chop them finely with a knife (1-2-3).
Heat the oil in a fairly large pan with the garlic clove, and as soon as it is browned, remove it with the help of a fork . Then add the finely chopped vegetables, stir , and let them stew for a few minutes adding a ladle of stock .
Once evaporated, add the finely chopped herbs . Add the rice and toast it for a couple of minutes , then deglaze with white wine and continue cooking by gradually adding the stock .
In the meantime, cut the perch fish into 0.2-inch pieces . Halfway through cooking, add half of the fish to the rice ; continue cooking with the stock, lightly salting and peppering .
Near the end of cooking (about 5 minutes before), add the reserved pieces of perch fish and add the grated zest of half a lemon . Once cooked, stir in the butter cut into cubes and serve your perch fish risotto piping hot !
Store the perch fish risotto closed in a container for up to 1 day in the refrigerator.
To further enhance this risotto, you can add other types of fish such as octopus, shrimp, and squid. Instead of fish stock, you can use vegetable broth!
