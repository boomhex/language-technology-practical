Fava bean, pea and artichoke soup? Yeah, it's the kind of dish that takes you straight to the Italian countryside in late spring. Everything's so fresh. Really, really fresh. In Lazio, folks call this classic mix 'vignarola romana.' The fava bean soup has this rich, earthy vibe, mainly because of those fresh fava beans. But—and here's the thing—it's the combo with peas and tender artichoke hearts that makes it shine. Each spoonful is packed. You've got tender beans, crispy peas, and these soft, earthy artichokes. Seriously good stuff.
This isn’t just any pea soup ; it’s more like a slice of Roman family tradition. People used to whip this up with whatever they could grab from the garden—pretty cool, right? In Lazio, it’s a must to toss a slice of toasted bread at the bottom of the bowl. And the egg on top? Makes it all warm and moist, which is great.
For modern family dinners, this artichoke soup keeps it rustic and cozy, but also fresh and new. You get all those old-school vibes from the Roman recipe, but it's pretty simple to make whenever spring veggies are around. It is light yet filling. Each bowl’s packed with greens and beans, and the soft egg? Adds a touch of richness without being heavy. Some folks in Lazio throw in local herbs or drizzle some good olive oil at the end for a golden touch. And look, this isn’t just one of those healthy vegetable soup ideas you try and then forget. It’s the kind of soup that gets everyone together—even the picky eaters.
Every bite? Feels straight from the garden—earthy, a bit sweet, and totally satisfying. Whether you're into vegetarian soup recipes or just craving something that tastes like spring, this easy homemade soup is always a winner. For real. It hits the spot, every time.
To prepare the broad bean, pea, and artichoke soup, first start by preparing the Vegetable broth . When it's ready, move on to cleaning the artichokes: first remove the outermost leaves , then cut off the tip and cut each artichoke in half .
Remove the inner fuzz , the stem, and as you go, place the artichokes in acidulated water (where you have squeezed 1 lemon) to prevent them from turning brown. Proceed to the How to Clean Fava Beans , then remove the outer skin .
Wash the head of escarole under running water and chop it roughly . At this point, take the green onions, remove the white root ends and the tougher green tops ,
then cut them in half lengthwise and into slices . Transfer them to a saucepan where you have poured the oil, let them soften for 1-2 minutes over moderate heat, and first add the crushed garlic and then the escarole . Stir everything and let it cook for 3-4 minutes,
meanwhile cut the artichokes into quarters . When the escarole has slightly wilted, add the artichokes , stir and wait 3-4 minutes before adding the broad beans
and the peas . Salt and pepper and pour in the hot vegetable broth .
Cover with a lid and cook your broad bean, pea, and artichoke soup for 30 minutes on low heat. When it is almost ready, make the croutons: slice the bread , place them on a baking sheet and drizzle with a little oil .
Toast the croutons for 2-3 minutes in a preheated static oven at 464°F in grill mode. When they are well browned, take them out of the oven and place one in the center of the plate . Crack the egg and gently let it slide on top of the crouton ,
keeping the soup warm . Then, using a ladle and very gently, pour the soup onto the serving plate all around the crouton, also pouring some broth (without vegetables) over the egg yolk so that it can cook slightly with the hot broth . Add a couple more croutons, a pinch of pepper, and your broad bean, pea, and artichoke soup will be ready to enjoy , just make sure to serve it piping hot!
The broad bean, pea, and artichoke soup alone can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days! When serving, bring it to a boil before pouring it over the egg!
A variation of this preparation involves beating the eggs with grated cheese and pouring them into the boiling soup, waiting for them to set without stirring; they are then served with a sprinkle of ground black pepper.
