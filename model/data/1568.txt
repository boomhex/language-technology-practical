Take the cod fillets and cut them first into strips and then into cubes, not too small . Pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, heat it, and add the cod . Let it brown on both sides for a total of 5 minutes, turning them gently.
Finally, salt and transfer to a plate . Then coat the cod cubes in the breading
to cover them completely . Lay the slices of speck on a cutting board and place each bite at the beginning of one of the slices . Roll up to get a roll .
Do the same for the others and place them in a baking dish . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 10 minutes. Then take them out of the oven and let them cool.
Arrange some lettuce leaves and a small bowl on a plate, then transfer the bites as well and fill the small bowl with mayonnaise . Your cod and speck bites are ready to serve !
