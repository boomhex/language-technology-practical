To prepare the honey caramelized salmon, start by placing a pan with a drizzle of oil on the stove, add the salmon fillets and cook them over medium-high heat for 10 minutes, without turning them . Meanwhile, sift the ricotta in a separate bowl, helping yourself with a spatula and a sieve ;
add the ground turmeric and fresh liquid cream to the ricotta, salt to taste, and mix well with a spatula to blend everything together .
Transfer the ricotta mixture into a siphon , screw on the cap , and insert the gas inside, then shake vigorously. After 10 minutes of cooking, gently turn the salmon fillets with a spatula ,
salt , pepper, lower the heat and cook over low heat for another 2-3 minutes. Then pour the honey into the pan and cook for about 2 more minutes. At this point, gently remove the salmon fillets from the pan, preserving the cooking juices ,
and transfer them to the serving plate, on which you have placed some lamb's lettuce leaves . Now deglaze the cooking juices by pouring a ladle of water into the pan where you cooked the salmon and bring it to a boil, stirring until it thickens to form a sauce .
To serve, add a dollop of ricotta foam next to the salmon and sprinkle with a teaspoon of the cooking juices : your honey caramelized salmon is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to serve the honey caramelized salmon as soon as it's ready. Freezing is not recommended.
If you don't have a siphon, you can whip the fresh cream separately and gently mix it with the ricotta and turmeric mixture. As an alternative to thyme honey, wildflower or acacia honey will also work well; you can also add lemon or lime zest to the salmon for an even more aromatic result!
