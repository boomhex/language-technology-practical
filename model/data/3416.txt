Aspic millecolori is one of those dishes that instantly grabs your attention as soon as it hits the table. Really good stuff. It’s got these layers of bright, crisp vegetables all set in a shimmering gelatina alla birra . You can’t miss this antipasto freddo —it's all about show-stopping looks and surprising flavors. And here's the thing, in Italy, folks from different regions pick their veggies based on what's fresh or what’s in their gardens. So, so clever. In the north, you’ll see tender asparagus or peas. Meanwhile, down south, they might use peppers or toss in a bit of seafood for extra color.
The secret ingredient? It's the beer-infused gelatina salata . I gotta say, it gives everything a little tangy kick, a taste you’ll remember, especially when you catch a bite with carrot or radish. This isn’t just any old salad, no way—it's a piatto scenografico that makes you stop and stare before you dive in.
Aspic millecolori is perfect for anyone who loves their food looking as good as it tastes. Really. The fun part? Picking the veggies. Go crazy with greens, or add sweet red peppers, maybe a touch of corn for a golden look. It takes some patience to arrange them, but trust me, it’s worth it when those layers pop against the clear gelatina alla birra . At summer parties, or even fancy Sunday lunches, this antipasto colorato gets people talking. It’s light, a bit cool from the fridge, and pairs well with just about anything else. And you know what? If you’re into creative cooking, the ricetta aspic lets you experiment—maybe different herbs or swap in local cheeses for a fresh twist. Whether you’re hosting a gathering or just treating yourself, aspic millecolori stays true to Italian summer style: fresh, colorful, and a little unexpected, making every meal feel special. Really, it’s super super exciting.
To prepare the multicolor aspic with beer gelatin, start with the vegetable broth, which will be used to make the gelatin. In a saucepan, place the water and the beer along with the already washed and cleaned carrot, celery, and onion , add salt, and bring to a boil, cooking over low heat for about 20 minutes. After this time, strain the broth and add enough water to bring the total liquid to 500 ml. Meanwhile, blanch the peas and diced carrots for a couple of minutes in boiling water.
Prepare the vegetables: cut the peppers into 24 strips from the yellow pepper and 24 strips from the red one and cut the remaining parts into cubes . Cut the olives into rings
and the hard-boiled eggs, making 8 slices . Meanwhile, soak the gelatin sheets in cold water and when they have softened, squeeze them well and dissolve them in 3-4 ladles of hot broth (which you can also put back on the heat) . Then add this liquid to the remaining vegetable broth and let the mixture cool at room temperature.
Now proceed with composing the aspic: prepare 8 steel molds with a capacity of 165 ml and note that each layer of beer gelatin, which will make up the multicolor aspic, will be 15 gr and will need 15-20 minutes in the fridge to set (or 10 minutes in the freezer). Start from the bottom by pouring a layer of gelatin equal to 15 gr (to be sure, place the mold on a scale, tare it, and weigh the gelatin as you pour it). When the bottom has set, place a slice of hard-boiled egg in the center, cover it with gelatin , and let it set. Continue with diced cooked ham, being careful to arrange the ham in a radial pattern around the mold for a very neat final effect, and complete with other cubes in the center.
Pour another layer of beer gelatin on top and let it set. Continue with a layer of peas, taking care to arrange them always in a harmonious way , cover with gelatin, and let it set .
Then proceed to the peppers: arrange 3 strips of red pepper alternating with 3 strips of yellow pepper along the perimeter of the mold and fill the center with pepper cubes . Always cover with gelatin and let it set. Finally, the final layer: arrange the olive circles alternating the colors around the mold
and complete the layer with carrot cubes . Cover with the last layer of gelatin and let everything set in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours. When it is well compact, unmold your aspic by quickly dipping it in hot water and releasing the edges from the mold with the help of a smooth-bladed knife . Your multicolor aspic with beer gelatin will be ready to be served.
To make your aspics even more beautiful, you can prepare small shapes (heart or flower) cut from carrots or celery and position them in the center of the mold before pouring the first layer!
