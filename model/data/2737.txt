Instead, you get this rolled creation that looks super cool and tastes way way better. The outside? All about those tender eggs—like a soft omelet—but the real fun begins with what’s inside. Prosciutto and smooth cheese create this creamy layer, paired with a bright green pea puree that offers a sweet pop.
And you know what? Just when you think that's it, you hit bits of salty black olives and sun-dried tomatoes . They add a tangy kick and a bit of chew. It's a whole new take on an egg dish, making it more interesting without being too heavy.

You'll find this kind of stuffed pork roll or egg roll at summer buffets, cut into neat slices that are moist and super colorful. Seriously good. It’s great for second courses, but, to be honest, it’s just as good as finger food when friends are over. That mix of prosciutto and cheese is incredible, but the peas and olives add that little something extra you don’t always expect.
Many regions in Italy have their own ways to fill these rolls—sometimes with spinach, sometimes with artichokes—but this pork roll with peas and sun-dried tomatoes is all about fresh flavors and keeping things balanced. And here's the thing: everything holds together so well, making each bite creamy, a bit crispy at the edges, and packed with flavor.

It's a proof of the Italian way of elevating simple dishes with rich flavors, keeping everything fresh and exciting. And, look, you can't go wrong with that.
To make the pea roll with prosciutto and sun-dried tomatoes, start by shelling the fresh peas , then heat a pat of butter in a pan, add the peas and cook them for 5-6 minutes over medium heat, pouring hot water or vegetable broth as needed to keep them from drying out .
Let the peas cool and transfer them to a blender, add the milk and blend until smooth sieve the cream to remove the pea skin and obtain a smoother mixture. Roughly chop the prosciutto and place it in the blender ,
add the Philadelphia , salt and pepper, and blend everything to obtain a cream . Take the sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drain them, and pat them dry with a paper towel ,
then cut them into small pieces , and slice the black olives into rounds. Now handle the omelet, separate the yolks from the whites, and whip the whites to stiff peaks with an electric whisk (11-12).
Beat the yolks and also add the grated Parmesan cheese . At this point, incorporate the pea cream and lastly the whipped egg whites, folding them gently from bottom to top to avoid deflating them .
Once you have a homogeneous mixture , heat a slightly buttered 13.5-inch pan, pour the batter with a ladle to distribute it better (17-18),
cook with the lid on over medium heat for about 5 minutes, then flip the omelet using the lid itself (19-20) and continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes or until the omelet is nicely golden. Cover it with plastic wrap, and let it cool (this way it will remain soft and easier to roll). Fill the omelet with the prosciutto cream
the sun-dried tomatoes and the black olives . Roll up the omelet ,
then sprinkle the plastic wrap with grated Parmesan and wrap the plastic wrap around the roll, tightly sealing the ends to ensure it compacts well. Place the pea roll with prosciutto and tomatoes in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to firm up, then serve it sliced and enjoy it at room temperature.
You can store the pea roll with prosciutto and tomatoes in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 2-3 days. You can freeze the roll if you've used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
For a sea-flavored version, you can replace the prosciutto with smoked salmon. As an alternative to Philadelphia, you can also use Robiola or ricotta.
