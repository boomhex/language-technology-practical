Linguine con pesto di mandorle is a standout dish from Liguria , Italy, that really spices up the usual pesto vibe. And listen, instead of the usual pine nuts, this almond pesto recipe uses both peeled and unpeeled almonds—makes it super interesting. You get that sweet kick from the white almonds and, oh man, that slightly bitter edge from the skins. Plus, fresh mint and lemon add this bright, fresh vibe you just don’t see every day. Linguine or bavette is the go-to here because their shape just grabs all that creamy pesto, keeping every bite super tasty.
Folks in Liguria love showing off this dish. It looks fancy but is actually pretty simple—just throw it together, and you’re set. It always manages to wow with its tender noodles and creamy sauce. For sure. Pairing this easy almond pesto with a chilled, soft white wine really really brings out all those flavors. I mean, the almond mix is more than just a swap; it gives the sauce a rich, nutty taste that’s kind of addictive. Really.
The fresh mint and lemon peel don’t just add aroma—they actually cut through the richness and make everything feel lighter. So you get that creamy mouthfeel without feeling weighed down. This is one of those quick pasta dishes that comes together fast but feels so special. Pretty much perfect if you want to impress guests or just make dinner a bit more fun. Even picky eaters tend to go for it. Seriously good. Thanks to the moist, glossy sauce and how the noodles get totally coated in flavor.

To prepare the linguine with almond pesto, start by finely blending the blanched and unblanched almonds in a food processor . If you don't have a food processor, you can crush the almonds with a pestle or chop them with a knife. Once the almonds are chopped, add the basil leaves and oil ; season with salt and pepper. Wash a non-treated lemon well, remove the two ends, and grate the zest to add to the almond pesto .
Then squeeze the lemon and filter the juice through a fine mesh strainer . Add the filtered lemon juice to the pesto and finally the fresh mint leaves . Then turn on the food processor to blend the ingredients.
Thin out your almond pesto by adding hot water , enough to make it a smooth, dense cream with a lighter color . Then, place a large pot on the stove, fill it 3/4 full with water, salt to taste, and bring it to a boil; cook the bavette until al dente .
When the pasta is ready, drain it, reserving a glass of the cooking water. Transfer the pasta to a large non-stick pan and pour in the pesto to dress it . To prevent the pasta from drying out too much, you can add a little of the reserved cooking water . Sauté it for a few seconds and serve it hot. You can garnish your linguine with almond pesto with a sprinkle of pecorino cheese and some fresh mint leaves .
If you have leftover almond pesto, it can be stored in the refrigerator in a jar for 4-5 days. The pesto can be frozen in a jar.
A friendly tip: if you like cheese, add a sprinkle of pecorino or grana! If you want to enhance the almond flavor, well, what could be better than some toasted almond slices?
