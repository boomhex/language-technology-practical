instructions:
To make the gravy sauce, first prepare the Beef Broth using our recipe. Once the broth is ready, place the butter in a small saucepan and let it melt gently over low heat , to obtain a smooth and uniform base. When the butter is completely melted, add the flour and immediately mix with the hand whisk to create the roux .
Continue to work it over the heat, always stirring, until it starts to darken slightly and takes on a nice hazelnut color. At this point, incorporate the hot meat broth little by little , pouring it in a thin stream while continuing to stir vigorously to prevent lumps from forming . You will see that as you add the broth, the sauce will begin to thicken just like a béchamel, becoming soft and glossy. Continue cooking until you obtain a smooth and uniform creamy texture .
When the sauce has reached the desired consistency, transfer it to a heat-resistant bowl to serve . At this point, you can adjust the salt, if the broth is not already savory, and add a generous grind of black pepper to enhance the flavor of the sauce . Stir again and your gravy sauce is ready: warm, fragrant, and enveloping .
The gravy sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for 2–3 days, securely closed in an airtight container. When ready to use, simply heat it over low heat, possibly adding a spoonful of broth to restore its original consistency.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you don't have meat broth, you can substitute it with vegetable or chicken broth: the result will be more delicate but still rich and creamy. For an even more flavorful version, add the meat cooking drippings or a splash of white wine while reducing it.
Instead of flour, you can use cornstarch if you prefer a silkier consistency.
