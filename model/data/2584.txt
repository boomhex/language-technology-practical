So, let me tell you about this lasagne— Lasagne con radicchio, crema di castagne e speck . It's from the Trentino-Alto Adige region of Italy, and, truthfully, it's something special. We're talking about tender sheets of egg pasta, layered with this sweet chestnut cream. And the speck ? Oh, it's got that rich, smoky vibe—so, so good.
And here's the thing: The radicchio . It's got this bitter edge that just keeps things interesting, you know? Locals absolutely love how the crema di castagne smooths out that sharpness, bringing everything together with this creamy balance. It’s the kind of autumn dish that really shows off the region’s best flavors.
In Trentino-Alto Adige , families will often serve this on weekends. Really, it's comforting and special. You'll notice it’s a twist on the classic lasagne al forno —no heavy meat ragù here. Instead, it's lasagne con radicchio e speck with chestnuts, feeling moist and cozy.
The speck adds a crispy touch, sorta like bacon but with this amazing smoky Alpine twist. People say it’s one of the best ricetta lasagne gourmet because it mixes up traditional flavors in a fresh way. And the colors—seriously. Deep purple radicchio and golden pasta make it look as amazing as it tastes.
Basically, everything about this dish screams comfort and family time. Perfect for those long, chilly nights or any gathering where you want to feel that northern Italian pride. It's proof that when you mix the right local flavors, you get something really unique and seriously satisfying. Really really good, capturing the heart of autumn with every bite.
To make the lasagna with radicchio, chestnut cream, and speck, start by cooking the chestnuts: rinse them and place them in a pot, cover them with water , and boil for about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the speck into thin strips , remove the tougher part of the radicchio stem, wash the leaves, and cut them into strips about 0.5 inches thick ,
peel the shallot and chop it finely . In a pan, sauté the chopped shallot with a drizzle of olive oil for 10 minutes , then add the radicchio
season with salt and pepper, deglaze with white wine and continue cooking for a few minutes. Once cooked, turn off the heat and let it cool slightly , meanwhile, the chestnuts will be ready
drain them, peel them with a paring knife, and collect the pulp in a bowl , then pass it through a food mill (11-12).
In a pot, place the milk, flavor it with nutmeg , and add a pinch of grated salt, bring it to a boil, then add the chestnut puree and continue cooking for 6-7 minutes, stirring continuously until the cream thickens .
Everything is ready to assemble the lasagna: take an 8x12 inch baking dish, spread a layer of chestnut cream on the bottom , take the pasta sheets, and place three on the bottom , then continue with another layer of cream
then add the radicchio and the speck . At this point, place 4 pasta sheets on top in the opposite direction
spread the chestnut cream on top , the radicchio, and the speck . Finish with a final layer of 4 pasta sheets and dress as before with chestnut cream , radicchio, and speck.
Finally, season with grated Grana Padano (25-26). Bake the lasagna with radicchio, chestnut cream, and speck in a preheated static oven at 425°F for 20 minutes (or a convection oven at 390°F for 10 minutes) and grill for a couple of minutes once nearly cooked. Remove the lasagna with radicchio, chestnut cream, and speck from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.
You can store the lasagna with radicchio, chestnut cream, and speck in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container, for 1-2 days. They can be prepared the day before, kept in the fridge covered with plastic wrap, and baked the next day. They can be frozen, only if all fresh ingredients were used, preferably uncooked: to bake them, just thaw them in the fridge about 24 hours earlier and then cook them in the oven.
Here's a trick: to peel chestnuts more easily, you can score them before cooking!
