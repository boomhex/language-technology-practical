To prepare the fig and lemon popsicles, start by halving the lemons . Squeeze them and then strain the juice into a bowl using a sieve to remove pulp residues and seeds .
Then prepare the syrup: take a pot and pour in the water . Then add the sugar , stir and bring to a boil.
When the syrup has reached a boil, add it to the lemon juice and let it cool. Meanwhile, rinse the figs under running water, then place them on a cutting board and cut them into slices about a quarter-inch thick . Then, take the popsicle molds and line the sides with the fig slices .
Place the molds on the appropriate stand and gently pour in the cooled syrup with lemon juice . Insert the stick into each mold and freeze for at least 3 hours.
If the sticks tend to sink inside the mold, you can implement a quick fix: get some pieces of aluminum foil and fold them until you get strips. Place the stick in the center of each strip , fold one half to one side, then the other half in the opposite direction , until you secure the stick . This way, once the sticks are inserted into the mold, the aluminum foil tabs will rest on the edges, preventing the sticks from sinking.
After the 3 hours of freezing, take the popsicles out of the freezer and unmold them by quickly dipping the molds in hot water . Then remove the popsicles from the molds and serve immediately !
You can store fig and lemon popsicles in the freezer for up to a week.
If you don't like figs, you can use kiwi, and you can replace the lemon with the juice of your preferred fruit!
