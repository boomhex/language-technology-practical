instructions:
To prepare the potato crepes, first clean the onion and slice it thinly . Peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes . In a pan, add the onions and a drizzle of olive oil , let them brown for 5 minutes over low heat.
When the onion is soft, add the cubed potatoes , salt, and continue cooking for 10 minutes over high heat. As soon as the potatoes are soft , turn off the heat and slightly mash the potatoes with a fork .
In the meantime, crack the egg into a bowl, add a pinch of salt , the milk , and half of the flour .
Mix well with a whisk and then slowly add the remaining flour , stirring until you get a smooth batter . Adjust the amount of flour based on the batter's consistency. In a 20 cm (8-inch) diameter pan, melt a pat of butter ,
add 1/4 of the cooked potatoes and mash with a fork, spreading them across the entire bottom. Pour a ladle of batter over the potatoes and swirl the pan to distribute it well . Cook the crepe on moderate heat, and when it starts to peel away from the edges, flip it to the other side with a spatula .
Cook for about 2 minutes and then turn off the heat . Cut the brie into slices and fill the crepe with a few slices of cooked ham
and the brie . Fold the crepe over the filling . Transfer the crepe to a plate and continue with the remaining batter, remembering to always grease with some butter for subsequent cooking. Serve the potato crepes with brie and ham hot, accompanied by fresh salad .
We recommend consuming the potato crepes immediately. Freezing is not advised.
Grease the pan with a little butter before cooking each crepe to prevent them from sticking to the bottom.
