instructions:
To make Savoyard potatoes, start by peeling the potatoes , then slice them with a mandoline to obtain slices about 1/8 inch thick . Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and blanch the potato slices for a few minutes .
Drain the potatoes and let them cool and drain in a colander . Now, cut the fontina into strips and then into cubes and set aside.
In a small pot, place the butter in pieces and melt it over low heat . Meanwhile, butter a baking dish and line it with parchment paper, then arrange the potato slices in a fishbone pattern, slightly overlapping them .
With the help of a spoon, spread the melted butter over the entire surface and also the milk . Take the fontina cubes .
and distribute them evenly over the potatoes . Bake the potatoes in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 15 minutes, then continue for another 5 minutes with the grill. Once cooked, remove the dish from the oven , slice, and serve the Savoyard potatoes hot and melty .
Savoyard potatoes are best consumed immediately; if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator for up to one day, covered with plastic wrap, and then reheat in the oven before serving.
Freezing is not recommended.
