instructions:
To prepare the Rice pie with peas, asparagus, and zucchini, boil the brown rice in salted boiling water , following the cooking times indicated on the package. Meanwhile, in another small pot, blanch the parsley for 20 seconds and then drain it in a bowl with ice water .
Squeeze it and place it in a tall glass , add the oil and a pinch of salt , blend with an immersion blender .
You should obtain a very green sauce . In a bowl, mix the eggs with a fork , a pinch of cumin, a pinch of hot paprika, a pinch of salt, and pepper .
Also add the Parmesan cheese and mix to combine. Drain the rice in a bowl and let it cool for a few minutes, then add the egg mixture and mix well.
Also add half of the parsley oil and dried marjoram . Line the bottom of a 7.5-inch springform pan with parchment paper .
Spread the mixture in the pan , compact it well using a spoon. Once done, distribute the mixture on the edges. The more the rice is pressed well against the sides of the pan, the more we can be sure of its stability in cooking . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 30 minutes. Trim and slice the zucchini into rounds .
Clean the asparagus and cut them into 0.4-inch rounds leaving the tips whole . Also, cut the sun-dried tomatoes into thin pieces, drained from the preservation oil .

In a pan, pour a drizzle of oil and two unpeeled garlic cloves , sauté over medium heat for a few minutes. Pour the zucchini into the pan , also add the asparagus and the peas and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, so that the vegetables become well browned.
Also add the tomatoes . When the vegetables are cooked but still crunchy, turn off the heat, remove the garlic, adjust the salt if necessary, and season with the remaining parsley oil, mix, and set aside. When the base is cooked, remove it from the oven , let it cool.
Transfer the pie onto a serving plate. Fill it with the vegetables and finally garnish with Parmesan shavings and mint leaves . The Rice pie with peas, asparagus, and zucchini is ready to be served .
The rice pie with peas, asparagus, and zucchini can be stored in the refrigerator in a closed container for 2 days.
If you prefer, you can replace the asparagus with artichokes or the peas with green beans, the vegetables can be substituted with other seasonal ones.
