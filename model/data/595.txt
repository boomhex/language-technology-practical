Pork tenderloin wrapped with agretti is like a peek into how folks in Northern and Central Italy cook when they're after something special—yet pretty simple.

A pop of sweet and tangy flavor, adding a hint of French influence. And you know what? In this Italian twist, it blends perfectly with the salty cured pork.
Searing the meat first means you get a golden crust on the outside while keeping the inside super tender. It’s the kind of wrapped pork tenderloin you'd find at a family lunch in Emilia-Romagna or Tuscany. Especially when agretti—those cool, grassy spring greens—are in season. Agretti fits with using fresh, local produce, making it a standout for anyone wanting new agretti recipes to try out.

Folks love how the saltiness from the pancetta or speck blends with the sweet glaze and the crispy edges from the oven—no wonder this pork tenderloin with agretti is a hit at big Sunday meals. For sure, it’s a great example of how pork tenderloin side dishes in Italy aren’t just potatoes or bread but fresh garden produce that makes the meal pop.
