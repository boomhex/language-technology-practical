To prepare baked eggplants and onions, start by placing the washed and dried eggplants and onions on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Leave them whole and do not peel them. Cook them in a preheated oven for about an hour at 356°F (320°F for about 50 minutes if using a fan oven), adjusting based on the size of the vegetables. When they appear soft and wrinkled, turn off the oven and let them cool . Cut off the top of the eggplant and peel it .
Cut the eggplant into slices about 1 inch thick . Then cut each slice into three or four pieces . Take the onions and remove the bottom part of the onion .
