instructions:
To prepare fried cream, start by making the pastry cream with the indicated amounts. Cook the cream well until it reaches a rather firm consistency , then pour it into a baking dish lined with plastic wrap and spread it so that it has a thickness of about 0.75 inches (for this quantity, we used a square pan measuring 9x9 inches) . Level the cream well with a spatula and then let it cool in a cool, dry place for about 2 hours (do not place the cream in the refrigerator and do not cover it, otherwise it will remain very moist). When the cream is well chilled, transfer it to a cutting board and cut it into cubes or diamonds, using a sharp knife .
Coat each piece of cream first in breadcrumbs , covering it well on all sides, then in beaten egg , and then again in breadcrumbs .
Fry the cream bites in hot peanut oil until golden. Drain them with a slotted spoon and place the fried cream on absorbent paper to remove excess oil . With this amount, you will obtain about 40 pieces of fried cream!
We recommend consuming the fried cream as soon as it is ready.
In Emilia, unlike in other regions, fried cream is considered savory and is served as an appetizer, along with a delectable mixed fry of vegetables and cheeses.
