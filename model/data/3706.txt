Grasp the whole bud of petals with one hand and with the other hand, make a slight twist at the base of the rose: in this way, all the petals should detach without breaking . After this operation, you should have the whole bud of petals in one hand and the stem of the rose with its base in the other . Check and clean the rose petals one by one with a very soft cloth, then put them in a bowl .
Crack an egg and separate the yolk from the white: place the latter in a small bowl. Pour some granulated sugar into another small bowl. Take one petal at a time, and with a kitchen brush, gently and entirely brush it with the egg white and then coat it in the granulated sugar . Place all the petals obtained this way on a tray, without overlapping them, and let them dry until they become stiff . Once dry, you can use your frosted petals to decorate cakes, cupcakes, ice cream, creams, mousses, fruit salads, etc.…
The roses you will use to make the frosted petals should be fleshy and semi-open. If you do not use the frosted rose petals immediately, you can store them in a glass container with an airtight seal and keep them in the refrigerator for a few days.
