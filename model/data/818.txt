instructions:
To prepare the wool roll bread, first make the dough. Pour the two types of flour into a bowl , add the dry yeast , and the sugar .
Mix with a spoon . Add the milk and mix again. Then pour in the egg and continue to knead, you'll see the mixture start to form.
Add the softened butter and the salt . Then knead the dough well with your hands .
When you have a smooth dough, transfer it to a countertop and knead it with your hands until it becomes smooth. Shape the dough into a ball and transfer it to a bowl . Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in the oven with just the light on for about 2 hours, until the dough has doubled in volume .
After the resting time, transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and divide it into 5 equal pieces . Take one of the balls and shape it into a ball again . Do the same for the other 4 .
Cover with a kitchen towel and let them rest for another 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the provolone into cubes . Roll each ball with a rolling pin to obtain an oval .
Now make close cuts with a knife or scraper only on the lower half of the oval dough . Place the cheese cubes in the center of the upper part and fold the side and top edges over the cheese .
Starting from the top, roll it up to form a small loaf . Continue in this way, arranging them inside a 9-inch pan, 2.5 inches high, lined with parchment paper and previously oiled on the edges. Place them next to each other to cover the entire perimeter of the pan . Then cover with plastic wrap.
Let rise for another hour in a warm place, until it reaches the height of the pan . Brush the surface of the brioche with milk and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 35-40 minutes. When it is golden brown, remove from the oven , wait a few minutes, and serve.
You can store the wool roll bread under a glass dome for a couple of days. Alternatively, you can freeze it once cooked.
You can enrich your brioche with cold cuts like cooked ham, salami, or speck. Alternatively, you can make it vegetarian by adding cooked vegetables like zucchini and eggplants.
