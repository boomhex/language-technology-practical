instructions:
To prepare couscous with salmon and feta, pour the couscous into a large bowl and season it with a pinch of salt , a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil , and a teaspoon of sweet paprika .
Add the tomato paste and cover with boiling water . Stir well to evenly distribute the seasonings .
Immediately cover with a plate or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 10 minutes: during this time, the couscous will absorb the hot water and swell, becoming soft and light. Do not stir it while it rests, so the grains maintain their shape without becoming sticky. Meanwhile, season the salmon fillets with salt , then heat a pan with a little oil and place the salmon fillets in it .
Cook for 3-4 minutes per side until they are golden on the outside and still soft and juicy on the inside . Once ready , remove the salmon from the heat and coarsely flake it .
Wash and halve the cherry tomatoes . Return to the couscous and fluff it with a fork to separate the grains , then add the cherry tomatoes .
Add the salmon , cubed feta , and drained pre-cooked chickpeas .
Finally, add fragrance with basil leaves torn by hand . Stir everything well and serve the couscous with salmon and feta warm or cold !
Couscous with salmon and feta can be stored in the refrigerator for one day in an airtight container.
If you prefer, you can replace the cherry tomatoes with grilled vegetables like zucchini or bell peppers!
