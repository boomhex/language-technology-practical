To prepare the tomato shortcrust pastry, start by mixing the tomato paste in the ice-cold water (1-2). Proceed with the technique of sablage: place the sifted flour, cold butter cut into pieces from the fridge , a pinch of salt in a food processor, and blend everything until you get a sandy-looking mixture. It's important that the butter is cold because this way it prevents it from melting too quickly during baking and making the pastry hard.
At this point, place the mixture obtained on a floured surface in the classic well shape and add the diluted tomato paste in the center , knead everything quickly until you get a compact, firm, and fairly elastic dough. Once ready, wrap your shortcrust pastry in a sheet of plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 40 minutes. After 40 minutes, the shortcrust pastry will be ready to use.
Place the shortcrust pastry dough on a slightly floured surface and roll it out with a rolling pin to a very thin thickness, about 1/8 to 1/6 inch, butter and flour the selected baking pan, and lay the pastry over the pan , making sure it adheres well. At this point, let the shortcrust pastry rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or 15 minutes in the freezer to ensure it firms up and holds its shape better.
Remove the pan from the refrigerator and prick the bottom of the shortcrust pastry with the tines of a fork , but be careful not to go too deep, or you might pierce the bottom and risk the filling escaping. Now you can proceed by filling the pie with the desired filling, or you can bake the pastry following the blind baking method. For all the details, consult our cooking school on how to How to do blind baking . Cut a circle of parchment paper the same diameter as the pan and place the circle inside the pan, arranging it to cover the edges as well. Then place dry beans or weights suitable for this type of baking inside the mold . Preheat the oven to 392°F and bake the pastry in a static oven for about 15-20 minutes. Unmold and remove the beans and parchment paper; at this point, the edges will be well browned but not the bottom, so bake again for 10-15 minutes at the same temperature so that the pastry dries out and becomes golden. Remove the base from the oven and brush it with beaten egg on the base to seal the filling, then bake it in a hot oven for a couple of minutes so that the egg forms a sealing film. Once cooked, take out the tomato shortcrust pastry bases from the oven and fill them with the fillings you prefer .
Store the tomato shortcrust pastry in the refrigerator, sealed in an airtight container, for up to a couple of days.
You can flavor the tomato shortcrust pastry by adding aromatic herbs such as basil or oregano to the dough.
