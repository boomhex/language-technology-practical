instructions:
To make the potato and mushroom casserole, first take care of the mushrooms: use a damp cloth to clean the surface of the caps and the stem to remove the soil, then use a small knife to separate the stems from the cluster and slice them. Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan and add the mushrooms , cooking over high heat for 5 minutes, then salt, pepper, and season with thyme leaves.
Also scent with lemon zest and set aside. Rinse the potatoes and slice them with a mandolin to a thickness of about half a millimeter .
Grease the bottom of a 11x7 inch rectangular baking dish with oil and sprinkle with breadcrumbs. Start assembling the casserole: place a layer of potatoes slightly overlapping , salt and pepper.
Drizzle with a little oil and sprinkle the surface with grated cheese . Now distribute the sautéed mushrooms .
Proceed with another layer of potatoes and mushrooms, drizzle with oil, and season with salt, pepper, and cheese. Continue this way until the ingredients are used up, and finish with a layer of potatoes and cheese .
In a tall glass, pour the cream and eggs , season with a pinch of salt, and blend with an immersion blender . You should obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Pour the egg and cream mixture over the casserole . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 45 minutes. Once cooked, take out the potato and mushroom casserole and let it cool slightly before serving.
