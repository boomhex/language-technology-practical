instructions:
To prepare the spicy rice with fried egg, start with the sauce: pour a splash of oil into a saucepan and the chopped chili , and sauté over medium heat for about 5 minutes, pour in the tomato purée , and cook the sauce for 30 minutes.
Slice the nduja and add it to the sauce at the end of cooking , stir so that it melts. Salt and keep warm .
Clean and thinly slice the leek . Clean the peppers and cut them into strips first .
Then cut them into 1/2-inch cubes . Quarter the cherry tomatoes . Put a pan on the heat to warm up, when it's hot add the oil and the leeks .
Add the peppers and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Then pour in the tomatoes and sauté for another 5 minutes. Salt and keep warm .
Cook the rice in plenty of salted water, keeping it undercooked by a couple of minutes compared to the times indicated on the package . Drain the rice and pour it into the pan where the vegetables were cooked .
Add the tomato sauce . Sauté everything together over high heat to dry the rice a bit and obtain a crust. Meanwhile, heat the extra virgin olive oil in a pan , it should cover the entire bottom. Break an egg into a bowl and pour it into the pan .
Cook for 3 minutes and salt. Transfer the rice to the plate , complete with the fried egg and fresh marjoram .
We recommend consuming the spicy rice with fried egg immediately. You can store the seasoned rice, but without the egg, in the fridge for a couple of days. We do not recommend freezing.
You can also make this recipe in a vegetarian version by omitting the nduja and increasing the chili dose according to your taste.
