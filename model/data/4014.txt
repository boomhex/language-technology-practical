Almond butter is a rich and flavorful spread that can be used as it is, spread on toast, fresh bread, and can also be paired with fresh fruit. But that's not all, almond butter can also become a special ingredient to enhance the flavor of muffins, cakes, cookies, and even smoothies. Its uses in cooking mimic those of the famous Peanut butter , a staple in American households where it's used to make quick and tasty sandwich fillings. If you love the Anglo-Saxon style breakfast, try this spread as a topping for waffles , pancakes , or a wholesome porridge to start your day with flavor and energy!
To make almond butter, place the peeled almonds on a baking sheet , toast them in a preheated convection oven at 370°F for 8 minutes. Once they are warm , not completely cooled, pour them into the mixer and set the blades to the lowest speed.
At first, you will have a crumbly consistency , then the mixture will bind , and it will then become more fluid. These 3 phases will occur in about 6-7 minutes, depending on the type of mixer. Be careful not to overload your mixer; if it gets too hot, let it rest. After 10 minutes, season with cinnamon and salt .
Add the honey and sesame oil . Restart the mixer and blend for another 5 minutes. A total of 15 minutes should suffice for the almonds to release their essential oils, resulting in a smooth and lump-free cream . Refrigerate for an hour before using your almond butter .
Almond butter can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a month.
It's important to pour the almonds into the mixer while they are still warm. To achieve a good texture, the mixer blades should be very close to the bottom of the bowl so the mixture blends uniformly.
