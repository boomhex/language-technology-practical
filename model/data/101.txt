instructions:
To prepare the roasted cauliflower with almonds and green sauce, start by removing the outer leaves of the cauliflower , then place it on the cutting board and cut it into slices about 1 inch thick , keeping the base intact to prevent them from falling apart .
Heat a drizzle of oil in a non-stick pan and gently place the slices . Sauté them over medium heat on both sides until they are golden and crispy on the outside, but still tender inside . Add a pinch of salt and set aside.
Meanwhile, prepare the green sauce: finely chop the parsley and chives , then thinly slice the chili pepper .
Combine everything in a bowl , then add the extra virgin olive oil and apple cider vinegar .
Season with a pinch of salt and spices: paprika and chili powder . Finally, add the finely chopped garlic and mix well until you obtain a fragrant and bright sauce.
In another pan, toast the almonds for a few minutes over low heat , stirring often to prevent them from burning . When they are well toasted, chop them coarsely with a knife . Now you can plate: place 1 or 2 slices of cauliflower on the plate .
Sprinkle them with the green sauce and finish with the toasted almonds. The roasted cauliflower with almonds and green sauce is ready to be served !
The roasted cauliflower and its sauce can be stored separately in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
We do not recommend freezing.
Add a few drops of lemon juice to the green sauce to make it even more fresh and lively.
