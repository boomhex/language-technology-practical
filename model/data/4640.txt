instructions:
Only three ingredients to bake a dessert perfect for breakfast! Milk and biscuit cake, a super soft idea that combines the goodness of milk with mixed dry biscuits and a bit of baking powder. A true magic happens when combining just these three ingredients blended together. We chose to shape it as a loaf, but you can also make your milk and biscuit cake heart-shaped or round! Whatever shape you choose, the essence won't change: milk and biscuit cake is a simple, ingenious, and naturally sweet idea!
With biscuits, you can also make:
To prepare the milk and biscuit cake, you can choose mixed dry biscuits, even chocolate ones . Pour the dry biscuits into a sufficiently large mixer and blend them into a powder .
Add the baking powder and the milk . Then blend again to mix everything well .
Butter and flour a loaf pan of 8.7x3.15x2.75 inches and pour the obtained mixture . Bake the milk and biscuit cake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 45 minutes. Check the doneness with a toothpick before removing from the oven: if it comes out clean after inserting into the cake, it's ready! Remove from the oven and let cool at room temperature in the pan .
Then remove the loaf from the pan and sprinkle with powdered sugar to taste . Your milk and biscuit cake is ready to be served !
The milk and biscuit cake keeps for 3-4 days under a glass dome.
It can be frozen in slices.
You can flavor the batter with orange or lemon zest, or with vanilla.
