Patate ripiene di nonna Franca is really a fun twist on the whole idea of stuffed potatoes . Straight from Florence in Tuscany, it skips the usual baked routine. Instead, each potato gets hollowed out—packed with a rich, tender ragù brightened with fresh herbs, lemon zest, and a green chili kick. And look, folks in Florence have this cool way of cooking them. They stand the potatoes upright in the pot, which is great because it keeps the shell soft and moist while the filling stays put. The result? Totally different from the dry, crispy baked potatoes you might be used to. Seriously good. Every bite has that satisfying mix of juicy meat and pillowy potato. Plus, you get those bursts of citrus and spice that set Italian stuffed potatoes apart from the usual. Really, really awesome.
And you know, some people in Tuscany get creative by swapping the ragù for a vegetable or even a fish-based filling. This makes it one of those traditional Italian recipes where you can put your own spin on it. Pretty authentic. The original is usually a side, but I gotta say, Nonna Franca’s stuffed potatoes are hearty enough to be the main event.

People love these at big family get-togethers because they’re easy to share and look great. Whether you stick with the classic or try something new, these Tuscan stuffed potatoes capture that old-school Italian spirit. For sure.
So, if you’re in the mood to try something a bit different but still cozy, this is the potato recipe that delivers every time. Perfect for Sunday lunch or a casual dinner with friends, these Florentine delights are sure to please. Seriously, why not give them a try and bring a taste of Tuscany to your table? Can't go wrong with this one.
To prepare Grandma Franca's stuffed potatoes, start by peeling the potatoes. Then cut both ends , so that the potatoes stand upright on their own. Next, take a small knife, make a cut along the inner perimeter of the potatoes, leaving a 1/8-inch border , and make a cut in the center of the flesh to facilitate extraction.
Still using a small knife, a melon baller, or a vegetable peeler, extract the inner flesh without piercing the bottom . Once all the potatoes are scooped out, place them in a bowl and cover them with water; this way they won't turn brown. Now focus on preparing the ragù ingredients: make an incision in the sausage and crumble it into a small bowl .
Then place the smoked bacon on a cutting board and cut it into strips and then into cubes . Peel a garlic clove and chop it finely, then pour extra virgin olive oil into a pan, and once hot, sauté the chopped garlic for a few minutes, then deglaze with water or vegetable broth . To find out how to prepare it best, consult our Cooking School: Vegetable broth . When the liquid has evaporated, add the crumbled sausage .
Continue by adding the cubed smoked bacon and stir with a wooden spoon to crumble the meat well. Then add the chopped carrot and fresh scallion and let cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Afterward, pour a ladle of vegetable broth and also add the ground meat .
Stir to crumble the meat and deglaze with dry white wine. Pour a tablespoon of tomato paste into a small bowl and dissolve it with a bit of broth, then add it to the cooking ragù . Meanwhile, cut the cherry tomatoes into quarters .
Finely chop marjoram, thyme, rosemary, and parsley , then add the quartered cherry tomatoes and the chopped aromatic herbs to the ragù (17-18).
Add the zest of half a lemon and the chopped green chili pepper with seeds removed . Salt and pepper to taste and let the ragù cook for at least 30 minutes. When it has dried out, remove the lemon peels and adjust salt and pepper if necessary.
At this point, you can drain the potatoes, dry them with paper towels, and place them side by side in a wide pan, also suitable for oven cooking . Salt them inside one by one and fill them with the ragù to the brim ; 2-3 tablespoons per potato will be enough.
All that remains is to continue cooking, basting the potatoes with oil and vegetable broth up to one-third of their height (25-26). Cover with a lid and let cook for 50-60 minutes leaving a small vent. If the potatoes dry out too much, add some vegetable broth. For a crunchier effect, once cooking is finished, you can put your stuffed potatoes under the grill at 400°F for 10 minutes. You can also cook the whole dish in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 90 minutes. All that's left is to let Grandma Franca's stuffed potatoes cool slightly and enjoy them to the fullest!
You can store Grandma Franca's stuffed potatoes in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container for 2-3 days. If you used fresh, not frozen, meat, you can freeze your stuffed potatoes and thaw them as needed in the refrigerator.
Potatoes are like pork; nothing goes to waste! You can chop the scooped parts and add them to the ragù, or save them for a soup base. If you want, you can vary the filling: maybe a vegetable ragù or by lining the inside of the potatoes with bacon! As for cooking, you can bake the dish entirely in the oven at 350°F for 90 minutes, basting it from time to time with vegetable broth. To check for doneness, poke the potatoes near the base with the tip of a knife or a skewer.
