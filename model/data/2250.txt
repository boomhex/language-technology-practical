To prepare rice and cabbage, start by making the Vegetable broth . Once ready, wash and dry the cabbage thoroughly. Peel off the outer leaves , cut it in half , and remove the tougher central rib, using a small but sharp knife: just make a triangular cut around the part to be removed .
Slice the cabbage into julienne strips and set aside. Proceed by slicing the bacon first into strips and then into cubes and set it aside as well. After peeling the onion, finely chop it .
In a non-stick pot with high sides, sauté the onion with the oil over low heat , stirring occasionally. Once golden, add the bacon : let it fry for a few minutes to form a light crust on the surface. Continue stirring to prevent the bacon and onion from sticking to the bottom of the pot. At this point, add the cabbage .
Continue to stir the ingredients for about 10 minutes over low heat . At this point, it won't be necessary to add liquids as the cabbage will naturally release them. Now pour in 3 1/2 cups of broth and let it cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally for at least 35-40 minutes, covering with a lid .
At this point, add the rice , mix the ingredients well , and pour in the remaining broth . Let it cook over moderate heat until you get a sort of thick, almost dry soup.
A few minutes before the end of cooking, add the grated cheese , mix well . Finally, season with salt and pepper and serve your rice and cabbage !
Rice and cabbage can be stored for up to 2 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. We do not recommend freezing.
To make the preparation even more flavorful, you could add Pecorino cheese or substitute it entirely with Grana Padano.
