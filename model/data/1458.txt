Whole wheat spaghetti with faux guanciale is such a fun twist on a classic Roman dish. In the Lazio region, people take their carbonara very seriously, but this vegetarian carbonara offers a fresh take while keeping those traditional touches. Instead of the usual guanciale, it uses a meatless guanciale substitute —imagine seitan cooked until it's crispy on the outside and tender in the middle, mimicking that salty pork flavor. Really good stuff. Homemade whole wheat spaghetti brings a nutty taste and a satisfying chew, with eggs and Pecorino Romano tying everything together, just like in the original. This dish is a proof to creativity and effort, blending Roman roots with something new.
And you know what? Those golden pasta strands mixed with moist seitan bits create a plate that looks—and tastes—like the real deal, but a bit lighter and definitely more plant-forward. Really, really tasty.
Healthy pasta recipes don't always hit the same comfort notes as the classics, but this one? It comes pretty close. Sometimes you just want a plant-based carbonara that doesn't skip the meat but still holds onto that rich, savory feel. And look, this version achieves that with simple swaps, respecting the original Roman vibe. Different areas around Rome might swap out the cheese or pasta, but here, the focus is on using whole grain pasta and a reliable meat-free carbonara alternative .
Plus, that homemade touch really makes a difference. Honestly, you don't miss the meat as much as you might think. The tangy cheese, the crispy bits, and the tender pasta all combine in a way that feels both familiar and new. Pretty much a winner. Whether you're a fan of vegetarian Italian dishes or just looking to eat a bit lighter without sacrificing flavor, this twist works beautifully. It is a fun way to shake up pasta night with something that feels a bit special and totally Roman at heart. And the sauce? Seriously good.
To prepare the whole wheat spaghetti with fake guanciale, first pour the whole wheat flour into a bowl , then add the eggs and start mixing with a fork .
Then transfer the mixture to a surface, work it until you get a compact dough , and wrap it in plastic wrap . Let it rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Then take the seitan and cut it into slices first
and then into strips . Transfer it into a bowl, add soy sauce , a drizzle of oil , and a grind of pepper
and mix everything together . Then cover with plastic wrap and let it marinate until cooking time. After 30 minutes, take the dough again , break off a piece
and flatten it using a bit more whole wheat flour . Pass it through the pasta machine , starting from the widest thickness and gradually reducing it. Fold the dough sheet and pass it through once again to smooth it out.
When you have obtained a rectangle of dough, cut it to the desired length to make the spaghetti and pass it through the appropriate roller . As the spaghetti is ready, place it in nests on a floured board .
Once you have prepared the spaghetti, place a pot full of salted water on the stove for cooking the pasta; then proceed with the seasoning. Pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, add the seitan drained from the marinade and braise it . When it is well browned, add a ladle of water and let it deglaze.
At this point, cook the spaghetti for 4-5 minutes . Meanwhile, in a bowl, pour egg yolks and Pecorino ; then beat with a whisk.
Stir the spaghetti occasionally and pour a ladle of cooking water into the egg mixture . Then drain the spaghetti, keeping aside a little more cooking water, and transfer them into the pan with the seitan .
Add another ladle of cooking water . Move the pan off the heat and pour the egg yolk and cheese mixture into the pasta . Stir again ,
add chopped parsley , a pinch of black pepper , and serve .
The seitan can marinate all day in the refrigerator. Dried spaghetti can be stored like any fresh pasta. To dry them, just lay them on the appropriate wooden sticks. Once dry, you can store them in a tin can or a food bag. The prepared dish should be consumed immediately.
Instead of seitan, you can use mushrooms or fava beans or asparagus for a spring touch!
