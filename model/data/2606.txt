To make the shish kebabs, wash all the vegetables and dry them, cut the bell pepper in half , remove the stem, seeds, and inner filaments, then cut each half lengthwise in two. Trim the eggplant and cut it into slices , do the same with the zucchini ,
halve the cherry tomatoes and proceed to cooking. Place a cast iron grill on the stove, heat it up, and grill all the vegetables by placing the bell peppers and cooking them on both sides for less than 1 minute, or just enough time to create the typical grill marks. After cooking, dice the bell pepper and set aside.
Continue grilling the eggplants , zucchinis , and tomatoes in the same way.
Set aside the vegetables in separate bowls; they will be used to compose the shish kebabs. Drain the capers, dry them, and then chop them together with the aromatic herbs , squeeze the lemon juice and strain it, in a small bowl emulsify the olive oil and lemon juice
add the chopped herbs and capers , set aside the marinade obtained and focus on the salmon. Remove any bones from the fillet with a special tweezer, then cut the salmon into 3/4 inch x 3/4 inch cubes , take a wooden skewer and assemble the skewers alternating a salmon cube (for a total of 4 cubes per skewer) with the various grilled vegetable bites .
Place the shish kebabs in a baking dish and flavor them with the marinade , cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to marinate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the accompanying sauce: in a small bowl, pour the yogurt and soften it by mixing with a whisk , flavor it with a pinch of salt and fresh thyme leaves ,
mix to blend and flavor the sauce and store in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Now proceed with the cooking, heat a cast iron grill, the heat should be very high, and place the skewers , cook them on all four sides, a few seconds per side. Once cooked, serve the salmon and vegetable shish kebabs hot, accompanied by the sauce .
Store the salmon shish kebabs with yogurt sauce in the refrigerator raw and cook them before serving. You can freeze the raw salmon and already grilled vegetables separately.
For marinating the salmon, you can use other aromatic herbs like mint or parsley. To accompany the skewers, you can also opt for a green sauce.
