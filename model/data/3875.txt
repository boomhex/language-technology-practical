instructions:
To prepare the melon filled with fruit and ice cream, start by cutting each melon in half . Then cut off the cap from both halves to create a base for what will become your melon bowls. Use a spoon or a melon baller to remove the seeds and filaments from the center of the melon .
With the appropriate melon baller, scoop out the melon flesh into balls and place them in a bowl. Drizzle the melon balls with Grand Marnier and let them marinate for about 30 minutes. Once the time is up, drain the melon from the marinade and place it in a bowl.
Add the washed blueberries and currants , setting aside 4 whole sprigs for decoration. At this point, take the emptied melon bowls and fill them with ice cream , placing 3 scoops in each bowl.
Distribute the melon balls and red fruits in the bowls, and add the raspberries; finally, decorate each bowl with a sprig of currants , a physalis , and a mint leaf. Your melon filled with fruit and ice cream is ready to be served !
The melon filled with fruit and ice cream should be consumed immediately. If you prefer a stronger Grand Marnier flavor, you can empty the melons in advance and let the flesh marinate from the evening before.
For an even more indulgent dessert, you can add dollops of whipped cream to your baskets and include the seasonal fruit you like most: it will be a real treat!
