instructions:
To prepare the anchovies alla pizzaiola, start with the How to Clean Anchovies of the fish. Begin by removing the head , then gently remove the central bone this way you will open the anchovies like a book. Rinse them under a thin stream of water to remove any residues, being very careful not to break the fish fillets .
Wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them into 4 parts and set them aside ready for use. Then, in a baking dish greased with about 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, arrange the anchovy fillets opened like a book along the length of the dish then the cut cherry tomatoes and some dried oregano .
Adjust with salt and pepper and squeeze some garlic, or chop it with a knife and then start again by arranging the anchovies opened like a book this time in the opposite direction to the previous one .
Then cover again with cherry tomatoes, salt, pepper, and oregano and sprinkle the surface with the remaining extra virgin olive oil . Place the baking dish on a baking tray and bake in a preheated static oven at 428°F for 20 minutes , let it rest a few minutes to settle, and finally serve the anchovies alla pizzaiola still very hot !
You can store the anchovies alla pizzaiola in the refrigerator for up to 1 day by covering with plastic wrap. You can also freeze the anchovies once cleaned.
A pinch of minced fresh chili pepper will make this dish even more flavorful. Or try adding some basil to give more aroma and a touch of green!
