instructions:
Wash each head of radicchio, about 4, then dry it and cut it in half lengthwise with a knife; massage each piece of radicchio with a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil.
Place a grill pan on the stove to heat; when it is very hot, place the pieces of radicchio on it, cooking them for at least 10 minutes and turning them often on each side.
Meanwhile, cut the bacon into small pieces and, using a food processor, chop it; then place it in a non-stick pan to brown, and after a couple of minutes add the pink pepper. Once the radicchio is cooked, place it on a serving dish, sprinkle it with bacon and pink pepper, add a pinch of paprika, salt, and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve warm or at room temperature.
