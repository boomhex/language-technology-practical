To prepare the Olympic rings cookies, start with the Shortcrust pastry : cut half a vanilla bean and extract the seeds with the blade of a small knife . Place the sifted flour, cold butter, vanilla bean seeds , and a pinch of salt in the mixer.
Then blend everything and pour the resulting mixture onto a work surface, forming the classic fountain shape. Pour the sugar in the center along with the 2 egg yolks .
Briefly knead the shortcrust pastry and shape it into a dough ball that you can wrap in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to firm up for at least 30 minutes.
After the necessary time has passed, roll out the pastry to a thickness of about 1/4 inch and create circles with a 4-inch pastry cutter . Then make the hole with another 2.5-inch pastry cutter (you can re-knead the excess pastry to make more rings).
You will thus obtain the ring shape ; once ready, you can place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, keeping them relatively close together , and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 15 minutes (320°F for about 10 minutes in a fan oven). Once cooked, remove from the oven and let them cool.
Meanwhile, prepare the Water Glaze : pour the powdered sugar into a small bowl and gradually add the hot water , mixing with a teaspoon to obtain a fluid mixture . Divide it into five small bowls , as many as the colors of the Olympic rings.
Color each bowl by adding the necessary amount of liquid food coloring: red , black , green, blue, yellow .
Now, simply brush the surface of the rings, alternating the different colors and using a flat wooden spatula, being careful not to overflow . Let the Olympic rings dry on a cooling rack and then serve them for an original snack!
Store the Olympic rings in a glass container for 2-3 days or in a tin container. The dough can be frozen wrapped in plastic wrap and thawed as needed in the refrigerator.
If you prefer, you can flavor the shortcrust with lemon zest instead of vanilla seeds.
