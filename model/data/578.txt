instructions:
To prepare the Salmon Poke, start with the fish: cut it into sticks about 3/4 inch thick and then into cubes , alternatively, you can make sashimi cuts. Thinly slice the spring onion, cutting also the start of the green part . Peel the ginger .
Transfer the salmon to a baking dish, season it with grated ginger , spring onion , and soy sauce .
Mix, cover with plastic wrap, and leave to marinate in the fridge for about 1 hour . Take the sushi rice, rinse it well under cold water to remove starch residues. Pour it into a high-sided pot with 17.5 oz of water , turn the heat to high, cook with the lid on without stirring for 2 minutes, then lower the heat and cook for another 10 minutes without ever removing the lid or stirring. The rice consistency should be slightly al dente.
In the meantime, prepare the rice vinegar mixture, which will give a slightly tangy taste. In a small saucepan, pour the rice vinegar . Add the salt and sugar and heat over medium-low heat to dissolve them, stir and turn off the heat. Let it cool .
When the rice is ready, you can place it in a wide wooden container (or another non-steel material) . Be sure to moisten the bowl with water and then empty it: this way the wood will not absorb the vinegar. Pour the rice inside and add the vinegar mixture . Mix the rice by moving it with an edge so as not to crush it . It is important to mix until it appears shiny and well seasoned.
Wait for it to cool, stirring gently from time to time, and then cover with a damp cloth to prevent it from sticking . In the meantime, attend to the vegetables. Julienne the red cabbage with a mandoline or a knife, removing the first leaf. Grate the carrots , or if you prefer, cut them into thin sticks.
Slice the cucumber , and also the radishes . Blanch the edamame in a small pot with a bit of water for 2-3 minutes. Now you can assemble your Salmon Poke by first arranging the rice and then all the other ingredients in a circular pattern. Finally, season with a sprinkle of mixed sesame seeds and Teriyaki sauce, the salmon poke is ready to be enjoyed.
We recommend consuming the salmon poke immediately.
The most suitable rice for this recipe is Nishiki, available at oriental grocery stores. As an alternative rice grown in Italy, you can choose a low-starch rice like Originario. You can complete the dish with some chopped chives if you like. If you prefer softer rice, you can extend the cooking time by 3 minutes.
Before consuming raw, marinated, or not fully cooked fish, it is recommended to freeze for at least 96 hours at -0.4 degrees Fahrenheit in a domestic freezer marked with 3 or more stars, as per the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
