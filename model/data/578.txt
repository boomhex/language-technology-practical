Puff pastry fans , or ventagli di pasta sfoglia, are really really good treats straight from the heart of Italian sweet pastry traditions. Seriously good. These snacks are a staple at coffee breaks and family gatherings all across Italy. You only need a few simple ingredients—mainly ready-made puff pastry, a splash of water, and some sugar. Pretty simple. You can whip up these crispy little delights that look like fancy fans, also known as palmiers. The best part? Making these puff pastry fan cookies is super easy, and even beginners are amazed at how golden and beautiful they turn out. And you know what? In cities like Rome or Milan, they're often enjoyed with an afternoon espresso. Which is great. But they're just as perfect for breakfast or as a sweet pick-me-up. Plus, this type of pastry isn’t limited to Italy; you’ll find similar treats called elephant ears or other puff pastry shapes in bakeries worldwide. The Italian version keeps it simple with a tender, light bite.
For anyone who loves easy, quick snacks that taste like you put in way more effort than you actually did, this puff pastry fan recipe is a must-try. Italians sometimes serve them plain to let the crispy layers and sugar shine, but you’ll also find folks dipping them in melted chocolate or spreading on some jam for added flavor. And look, they pair well with all sorts of things: try them alongside fresh fruit, dunked in coffee, or even crumbled over a bowl of ice cream. These puff pastry desserts can be a bit like a fun kitchen project—rolling, folding, and watching the dough puff up in the oven is almost as fun as eating them. You end up with a treat that’s moist inside but golden and flaky on the outside, which is why they disappear fast at parties. With Italian roots and an all-around crowd-pleaser vibe, these homemade puff pastry treats are unbeatable when you want something that tastes fancy without any fuss. Whether you're in Naples or New York, they bring a taste of Italy to your table with ease. For sure.

Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Retrieve the puff pastries and cut slices approximately ½ inch thick .
Arrange the puff pastry fans neatly on the baking sheet , spacing them apart from each other, and bake in a convection oven at 350°F for 15 minutes or until the surface is golden . Your puff pastry fans are ready to be served !
Puff pastry fans can be stored in a cool, dry place, such as a tin box, for 2 or 3 days.
If you prefer, you can replace granulated sugar with brown sugar.
