Pesce spada al cartoccio is one of those dishes you'll find right along the beautiful Sicilian coast, where people really know their way around fresh fish and strong taste. What sets this version apart is the intense aroma you get from marinating the swordfish in a double malt beer. It’s a move that’s totally different from the usual white wine—honestly, it makes the whole dish stand out at any dinner table. The beer adds a tender punch, soaking right into the fish and giving it a rich, almost moist taste that works great with those little bursts from cherry tomatoes and the salty bite of olives. You’ll see this style pop up not just in Sicily but even down into Calabria, especially in towns where swordfish is a local catch. Folks here love serving pesce spada alla birra for big family meals or anytime they want to impress with something a bit unexpected and full of flavor.
Unwrapping a tray of pesce spada con pomodorini e olive cooked "al cartoccio" just feels kinda special, especially when you catch that first wave of aromatic steam. And look, the method locks in all the flavors, so every bite is juicy and full of those Mediterranean tastes that make Sicilian food so popular. This isn’t your average fish bake; the combo of beer marinade, cherry tomatoes, and olives really gives the swordfish its own personality. For sure, people say this ricetta pesce spada al cartoccio works great as a main course for a seafood night or as a strong second dish if you’re doing a bigger spread of secondi piatti di pesce . You could call it a classic of cucina mediterranea, but the beer twist makes it way more interesting than most pesce spada al forno dishes. It’s the sort of thing that makes guests ask for seconds and want to know your secret. Really, for anyone looking to try out some real-deal, delicious ricette di pesce facili straight from the Italian coast, this one is a total winner.
To prepare the foil-baked swordfish, start with the marinade: in a large bowl, pour the extra virgin olive oil and chopped herbs , making sure to set aside a tablespoon to add later in the foil. Add the minced garlic and the juice of half a lemon together with the grated lemon zest .
Add salt and pepper and finally add the strong beer . Submerge the swordfish slices in the marinade and let them rest for at least an hour, or if you want to prepare it in advance, overnight.
In the meantime, prepare the vegetables for the foil: cut the potato into chunks , the cherry tomatoes in half , the spring onion, and the black olives .
On a baking sheet, prepare everything you need for the foil pack: lay a sheet of aluminum foil, on top of it a sheet of parchment paper, and place one of the two slices of swordfish that you have taken out of the marinade in the center . Start seasoning the fish with the chopped vegetables and the capers, rinsed and wrung out (11-12).
If desired, add more grated lemon zest , and finish with the chopped herbs , chopped parsley, salt, pepper, a drizzle of olive oil, and a tablespoon of marinade to enhance the flavor .
Preheat the oven to 400°F, close the foil packets by folding the parchment paper in the center first and then folding the sides , and do the same with the aluminum foil . Cook for at least 25 minutes, check the doneness of the swordfish (it depends on the thickness of your slice, if necessary leave it in the oven for another 5 minutes) and then remove it from the oven and serve it on two plates with its cooking juices!
For the chopped herbs, you can also use thyme paired with marjoram.
