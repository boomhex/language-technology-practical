instructions:
To prepare Santa Lucia's eyes, first pour the flour into a bowl, add the oil, the wine , and an egg .
Mix first with a wooden spoon , then with your hands until you get a homogeneous dough . Transfer it to a work surface and cover it with plastic wrap while you start forming the cookies, otherwise, it might dry out.
Take a portion and form a log about 0.6 inches thick . Then cut pieces about 4 inches long .
Form small rings by closing the freshly cut log , they should look like taralli. Transfer them to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes. Once cooked, take them out and let them cool.
When they are cool, prepare the glaze. Pour powdered sugar and water into a bowl ; mix with a whisk until you get a smooth glaze . Then dip only the top side of the tarallino into the glaze ,
then flip it over and place it on a tray lined with parchment paper. Repeat the same operation for all the others and let the glaze dry completely before serving your Santa Lucia's eyes .
Santa Lucia's eyes can be stored for 4/5 days in an airtight container at room temperature.
Add a little anise to flavor the dough.
In the Pugliese dialect, a drink or syrup made from water, sugar, and boiled fruit is called giuleppe . By extension, it has become a term to identify anything very sweet and sugary. Even the glaze for making Santa Lucia's eyes is called giuleppe .
