instructions:
To prepare duck breast with balsamic, first remove the feathers from the breast, pulling them out with tweezers . At this point, remove the excess fat with a knife and proceed to make cuts first at an oblique angle
and then vertically . Repeat the same operation for the other breast, then salt and pepper on both sides.
Place a pan on the fire and let it heat up; when it's hot, lay the duck breasts skin side down . After 3-4 minutes, flip them and let them brown on the other side as well. At this point, add the peeled onion cut into wedges and the garlic in its skin .
Add thyme and rosemary and deglaze with balsamic vinegar . Let it evaporate slightly and add the water (or vegetable broth if you prefer).
Cook the duck breast for about ten minutes (it should remain pink inside), then transfer it to a cutting board (13-14), keeping aside the cooking juices, which you will pour through a strainer. Strain the liquid by pressing the mixture with a spoon directly into the same pan where you cooked the duck breast.
Add the honey and cook for 3-4 minutes to obtain a sauce . Meanwhile, slice the duck breast
and lay the slices on a bed of mixed greens . Finish the dish with the freshly prepared sauce and serve your duck breast with balsamic .
We recommend serving the duck breast with balsamic freshly prepared. Freezing is not recommended.
Flavor the balsamic vinegar sauce to your liking! Add the spices and aromatic herbs you love most... like sage and bay leaf, for example!
