instructions:
To make the pasta with pistachio pesto and salmon, start with the pistachio pesto: place a pot full of water on the stove, bring it to a boil, then pour in the shelled pistachios , cook for 1 minute or just long enough to soften the skin, then drain the pistachios onto a kitchen towel and keep them warm; this will make it easier to remove the skin, simply by rubbing them . Transfer the pistachios to a blender, add the olive oil, grated Grana Padano DOP cheese, basil leaves, half a clove of garlic, and the grated zest of half a lemon. Pulse the blades for a few moments, then add the water, salt, pepper, and pulse the blender again.
Blend the mixture until you achieve a smooth cream . Cut the salmon into cubes , heat a splash of extra virgin olive oil in a pan .
Add the salmon , sear, salt, and set aside .
Cook the spaghetti in plenty of salted water . Dilute the pesto with lemon juice and a couple of ladles of cooking water , or as much as needed to make it creamy . Drain the pasta into the pan where the salmon was cooked .

With the heat off, add the pesto , stir, and finally add the salmon , and gently toss the pasta to avoid breaking it .
Plate and season with lemon zest and pepper . The pasta with pistachio pesto and salmon is ready to be enjoyed .
The pistachio pesto can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator for 4-5 days. It can also be frozen. The pasta can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 2 days.
In the pesto, you can omit the garlic for a more delicate flavor.
The pistachios can be blended with the skin on, but the final consistency will be different, more grainy.
It is important to peel the pistachios by rubbing vigorously when they are still warm, to facilitate the removal of the skin.
For an even more citrusy flavor, you can substitute lemon juice and zest with orange, or use both.
