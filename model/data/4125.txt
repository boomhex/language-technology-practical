instructions:
Stuffed bread is a whole wheat loaf filled with delicious ingredients: melty fontina cheese, Prague cooked ham, grilled peppers, and sun-dried tomatoes. Stuffed bread, really simple to prepare, is a truly original idea for the Easter Monday picnic or an outdoor lunch!
To make the stuffed bread, start by roasting the yellow pepper in the oven; when it's cooked, peel it and cut it into strips (alternatively, you can use pre-roasted peppers). Slice the fontina cheese thinly and cut the Prague cooked ham into strips .
With a serrated knife, cut the loaf into slices about 1.38 inches wide, but do not cut through the base of the bread; proceed by cutting the slices perpendicularly as well (again, without cutting through the bottom), thus obtaining a checkered surface . Start stuffing the bread: insert the fontina , and Prague ham into the cuts made,
the pepper strips , and the sun-dried tomatoes cut into pieces, making sure to push them well to the bottom of the loaf. Finish by sprinkling the bread with chopped chives . Melt the butter and brush the entire surface of the bread well . Then wrap the loaf in aluminum foil and place it in the oven at 356°F for about 15 minutes, then remove it from the foil and put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes. Bring your stuffed bread to the table and let your guests serve themselves!
We recommend consuming the stuffed bread as soon as it's ready, but if you wish, you can store it under a glass dome for up to one day.
With a little attention, it will be very easy to prepare a vegetarian stuffed bread: I suggest using grilled vegetables and fontina, or any cheese that melts well, since the loaf goes in the oven...Healthy and delicious!
