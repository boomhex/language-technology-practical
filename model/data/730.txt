instructions:
To make fried wontons, start with the dumpling dough: in a bowl, add the flour, salt , and water . Knead everything by hand, first in the bowl and then on the work surface .
You should obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture, quite hard and compact . Transfer the dough to a bowl and let it rest at room temperature for about 10 minutes, covered with plastic wrap . Meanwhile, chop the green part of the scallion and focus on the filling.
Put the minced meat in a bowl and add the rice wine , scallion , salt, and pepper. Mix well with chopsticks or a spoon to properly combine the filling .
Divide the dough in half, then roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured surface . Use a pasta machine to obtain very thin sheets . Stack the sheets, adding some flour between them. Cut squares of 3-4 inches per side .
You're ready to form the dumplings: place a square of dough on the palm of your hand and spread a teaspoon of filling in the center , then fold the square to form a triangle . Fold the base of the triangle further to seal the filling inside, pressing the filling slightly with your fingers and ensuring to leave the edges free .
Twist the two ends and make them meet, using a bit of water to help them stick . The first dumpling is ready : proceed in this manner to form all the others. Now heat the vegetable oil in a saucepan to a temperature of 340°F-355°F and fry the wontons for about 2 minutes.
When golden, drain on absorbent paper . Place the fried wontons on lettuce leaves and serve them with spicy and sweet and sour sauce !
It is recommended to consume the fried wontons immediately.
The dumplings can be prepared in advance and stored in the freezer, to be fried directly from frozen.
If desired, you can flavor the filling with a bit of fresh ginger.
