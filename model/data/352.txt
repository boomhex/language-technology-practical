instructions:
To prepare the Jerusalem artichoke cream with seared scallops, first focus on the green oil: place the parsley in a blender, then pour in the seed oil and blend for 5 minutes. Strain the resulting cream with a fine-mesh sieve and position a bowl underneath to collect the liquid. Place the sieve and bowl in the refrigerator and let it filter for 4 hours .
Move on to the Jerusalem artichokes: place the Jerusalem artichokes in a pot and cover with plenty of water , then cook for 3 hours, until the centers are soft. Turn off the heat and let them cool in their water, then drain the tubers and cut them in half .
Scoop out the pulp with a spoon and place it in a sieve to remove excess water . Meanwhile, take the green oil out of the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature .
Now transfer the Jerusalem artichoke pulp to a blender and blend at high speed for 3 minutes. Season with salt , add the almond milk , and blend again for at least 5 minutes until you obtain a smooth cream. Strain the cream through a sieve .
Collect the Jerusalem artichoke cream in a saucepan so you can reheat it just before serving. Finally, prepare the scallops: remove the roe and the tougher parts , then transfer them to paper towels to dry them.
Salt the scallops on both sides . In a non-stick pan, melt the butter , then place the scallops and sear them for 2 minutes on each side .
Reheat the Jerusalem artichoke cream . Meanwhile, halve the chilies lengthwise and remove the seeds, then slice julienne style . You're ready to plate: distribute a ladle of Jerusalem artichoke cream on the bottom, then add 5 scallops per plate and garnish with finely chopped chives and chili. Finish with a few drops of parsley oil, and your Jerusalem artichoke cream with seared scallops is ready to serve !
The Jerusalem artichoke cream with seared scallops should be consumed once assembled, but it's possible to store the individual ingredients separately, ready for use. The Jerusalem artichoke cream keeps in the fridge in an airtight container for 3 days. The scallops keep in the refrigerator, with paper towels and covered with plastic wrap, for up to a day.
You can get ahead by preparing both the green oil and the Jerusalem artichoke cream in advance.
With the leftover roe, you can make a mayonnaise following the recipe found here: scallops with peas and spinach!
