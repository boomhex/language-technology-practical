instructions:
To prepare the roasted pumpkin cream with crunchy vegetables, first clean the pumpkin, remove the peel , and set it aside. Cut the pumpkin flesh into slices ⅜ inch thick , then place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and season with a drizzle of oil .
Salt and bake in a preheated static oven at 338°F for about 35-40 minutes. Meanwhile, place the peels in a saucepan with water along with sage leaves .
Let it simmer for about 20-30 minutes . When the broth has reduced , strain it. By this time, the pumpkin should also be ready; it should be soft and golden .
Transfer the pumpkin to a jug, add a ladle of broth and blend with an immersion blender until smooth and creamy. Adjust the consistency by diluting with more broth if necessary, then season with salt . Keep warm.
Now handle the vegetables: peel the parsnip and cut it into matchsticks . Do the same with the carrot .
Thinly slice the white part of the spring onion . Finally, separate the florets from the broccoli and cauliflower and cut them into small pieces.
Heat a swirl of oil in a large pan, then add the carrots , parsnip, spring onion , and broccoli .
Add the cauliflower and sauté everything over high heat for a few minutes. When the vegetables begin to color, deglaze with the fermented sauce and slightly increase the heat to let it evaporate quickly ; they should remain crunchy.
You are ready to plate: pour the hot pumpkin cream into the dish and place the crunchy vegetables on top , then flavor with sumac and grated lemon zest .
Finally, garnish with fennel fronds and complete with the crunchy croutons . Your roasted pumpkin cream with crunchy vegetables is ready to be served !
The roasted pumpkin cream with crunchy vegetables can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days.
You can freeze it, without the vegetables.
You can replace tamari sauce with a legume-based fermented sauce.
Sumac adds a note of freshness, but if you can't find it, you can omit it and use just the lemon zest.
