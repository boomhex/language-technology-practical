instructions:
To prepare the tuna steak with mint pesto, start by making the mint pesto: in the bowl of a mixer, place the well-washed and dried mint leaves , add the pine nuts and the olive oil
Salt and pepper , then turn on the mixer to obtain a smooth sauce . Now focus on the marinade: chop the chives
in a bowl, pour the lemon juice , the olive oil , the minced garlic clove, and the chives ,
place the tuna, massage it with the marinade on both sides so it absorbs the flavor and season with pepper . Let it marinate for half an hour. Now proceed to cooking: heat a non-stick pan well, place the tuna and sear it for one minute on each side .
Once cooked, cut the tuna into slices ¾ inch thick . Place the tuna slices on a plate, season them with coarse salt and accompany your tuna steak with the mint pesto .
Consume the tuna steak with mint pesto immediately. It is possible to freeze the pesto in small jars and then thaw it in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also store the freshly made mint pesto in the refrigerator for 2-3 days in an airtight container, making sure to cover the sauce with a layer of oil.
If you want to add a crunchy note, before cooking pass the tuna in sesame seeds or a mixture of almonds or pistachios.
Before consuming raw, marinated, or not perfectly cooked fish, it is recommended to freeze it for at least 96 hours at -0.4 degrees Fahrenheit in a domestic freezer marked with 3 or more stars, according to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
