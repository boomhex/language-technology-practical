instructions:
To prepare the banana bread, start by peeling the bananas and cutting them into slices . Pour them into a bowl and sprinkle with lemon juice to prevent them from blackening .
Crush them with a fork to reduce them into a puree, then set aside. In another bowl, pour the chopped butter, soft but still pliable, and the sugar . Whisk with a hand mixer
and when you have obtained a homogeneous mixture add the eggs, possibly one at a time to combine them better . Add a pinch of salt , then pour in the banana puree .
Mix with a flexible spatula and add the sifted flour with baking soda and baking powder . Flavor with cinnamon and stir again.
Pour the dough into the 9x3.5" (22.5x8.5 cm) plumcake pan and level it off . Cook in a static oven preheated to 350° (180° C) for about 60 minutes. Try the toothpick test at the end of cooking, then remove your banana bread from the oven and let it cool before removing it from the pan. Enjoy the banana bread alone or with butter, peanut butter or jams.
Store the banana bread for a couple of days under a glass cloche.
It can be frozen, whole or in portions, once cooked and cooled.
You can flavor the banana bread with vanilla instead of cinnamon, add chocolate chips, or try it with coarsely chopped walnuts or almonds!
