Pasta with asparagus and egg cream is a big hit up in Northern Italy . People there love dishes that are both simple and a bit, well, special. And the asparagus? It’s the real star—tender but still has that fresh bite. Mixing up those egg yolks and fresh cream gives you a classic golden sauce. And think of it as a lighter asparagus carbonara, minus the meat.
In places like Lombardy or Veneto , some folks go for a lighter feel by swapping out the cream for a splash of water. Guess what? It’s still silky and smooth. Using gluten-free pasta means everyone can dig in—which is great for friends with different needs.
The way this creamy asparagus pasta turns just a few ingredients into something creamy and kinda fancy makes it perfect for a weeknight meal. People in Northern Italy love tweaking this recipe. Some folks throw in ricotta instead of cream for a fresh twist. Others keep it real simple with just eggs, asparagus and pasta, letting those spring flavors really pop. The egg cream sauce adds that rich golden color and moist texture, clinging to every piece of pasta.

One of those easy asparagus recipes you’re going to want to make again, no question, when spring rolls around. It’s got that Northern Italian vibe, you know, laid-back meals, good food, and good company.
Whether you’re into spring pasta dishes or looking for a vegetarian option with asparagus that feels special but is super doable, this recipe has you covered. Plus, the delicate green asparagus and golden sauce make your plate look really really inviting every time. Pretty much.
To prepare the pasta with asparagus and egg cream, start by cleaning the vegetables. Remove the base and keep only the tender green part. Peel them with the help of a vegetable peeler and cut the asparagus into slices, leaving the tips whole . Place a pot with plenty of water on the stove and bring to a boil, then salt it: this will be used to cook the pasta later.
Meanwhile, sauté the asparagus over medium heat in a pan with extra virgin olive oil for 7-8 minutes , adding some tablespoons of hot water as needed to facilitate cooking and soften them; halfway through cooking, add the asparagus tips which require less time . At the end of cooking, adjust the salt and pepper and turn off the heat. Then take care of the cream: in a bowl, pour the egg yolks and beat them together with salt and pepper , add the Pecorino Romano and continue to mix.
Pour the fresh liquid cream and mix until you obtain a smooth cream . At this point, you can cook the gluten-free pasta and then drain it al dente,
tossing it directly into the pan with the asparagus with the flame off . Add the egg cream , mix briefly, and your pasta with asparagus and egg cream is ready to be plated and served hot .
It is recommended to consume the pasta with asparagus and egg cream immediately; it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.
If you want to add an extra note of creaminess, blend a portion of the asparagus. For a crunchy note, sprinkle the surface with pine nuts or almonds.
For a lighter version, you can mix the yolks with water instead of cream.
