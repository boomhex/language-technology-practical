instructions:
To prepare baked asparagus, first wash the asparagus and remove the white part of the stem, which is the toughest . Apply light pressure on the stem, and the asparagus will bend at the point where the tough part ends. For this recipe, there is no need to peel the stem as baking will make them very tender . Choose a baking tray that can hold the asparagus based on their length. Grease the tray with extra virgin olive oil and add a crushed garlic clove .
Arrange the asparagus side by side, without overlapping them, then season with salt , pepper , grated Parmigiano Reggiano PDO , and a drizzle of oil.
Finish by scattering some lemon thyme . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 15-20 minutes, or until fully cooked. The time may vary depending on the size of the asparagus. Remove the baked asparagus from the oven, discard the garlic , and serve them hot , pairing them with your favorite main courses!
Baked asparagus can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
You can freeze them after cooking.
It is advisable to select asparagus of similar size for even cooking.
Lemon thyme is added for a bit of freshness; for a balsamic touch, you can use marjoram, either during cooking or before serving.
