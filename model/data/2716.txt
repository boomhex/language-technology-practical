So, Pasta al verde con gamberetti—ever heard of it? It's this shrimp pasta dish that's super popular in Liguria, up in northwest Italy. Thing is, it's not your typical pasta. I mean, it brings all those fresh and creamy vibes you’d expect from pesto but with its own twist. Instead of just basil, this sauce mixes spinach with either asparagus or zucchini, plus pine nuts and almonds. Really nice. You get that nutty hit and those vibrant, green veggie notes. The result? A bowl of green sauce pasta that feels like spring in every bite. Ligurians like to mix it up—sometimes there's more spinach, other times asparagus—depends on the season. And look, you might see this dish at a relaxed weekend lunch or even packed cold for a chilled coastal picnic. Seriously tasty.
Here's what makes this shrimp pasta recipe stand out: the way it balances those tender shrimp with the rich green sauce. This sauce just wraps around every piece of pasta—moist and silky. It’s the kind of meal that's perfect for a quick family dinner but, you know, it also feels special if you're hosting friends. Ligurian cooks love using the best seafood, so the shrimp here are super sweet, just barely sautéed to keep that juicy bite. For real, it’s a top-notch example of easy shrimp pasta with a coastal flair. Some folks call it pesto shrimp pasta, but honestly, it's its own thing—fresh, a bit nutty, really really satisfying. Whether hot or cold, with a lemon squeeze or extra nuts, it’s the kind of seafood pasta that keeps you coming back. Perfect for anyone hunting down healthy pasta recipes that taste awesome, this dish is a true taste of Ligurian charm.
To prepare green pasta with shrimp, start by washing the asparagus and peeling the tougher part of the stem . Boil the asparagus in an asparagus pot (or cook them in a wide pan, without tying them and laid horizontally), leaving the tips exposed . When cooked, immediately place them in a bowl filled with ice .
Soaking them for a few moments will help cool them quickly while retaining their color . Then cut them and set aside . Meanwhile, place the thoroughly washed and completely dried spinach in a blender .
Add the asparagus , then include the pine nuts and peeled almonds .
Continue with half a clove of garlic , olive oil , and grated cheese .
Blend everything until you get a smooth cream and set it aside while you proceed with cleaning the shrimp. Remove the head and shell , then place the shrimp in a large pan with a drizzle of oil .
Add salt to taste and deglaze with white wine . Cook for a few minutes, stirring just until the meat changes color, then turn off the heat .
Boil the pasta in plenty of salted water , while in a pan pour the green sauce and thin it with a ladle of cooking water . When the pasta is al dente, drain it and place it in the pan .
Add the shrimp and toss the pasta over medium heat for a few moments, adding more cooking water if necessary. Turn off the heat and your green pasta with shrimp will be ready!
You can store green pasta with shrimp in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 1 day. Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of asparagus, you can use grated zucchini drained of their moisture.
