Pugliese focaccia is really all about that soft, moist bite and those golden edges. And you know what? The trick is boiled potatoes in the dough. Seriously good. This comes straight out of Puglia in Southern Italy. Folks there really know how to make their Italian flatbread last longer and taste so so much better. Instead of the usual toppings like cherry tomatoes or oregano, onion focaccia from this region keeps it simple and bold with sweet onion slices and black olives scattered right on top. And the flavor? No need to fill the bread or hide anything—everything sits on the surface, soaking into the crust. Gives every piece a tender, savory vibe. It’s the kind of Pugliese focaccia that stands out at any table and works pretty much any time of day. For sure. Snack, lunch, or aperitivo? Can't go wrong.
Thing is, not everyone realizes how much the boiled potato in the dough changes things, but it really really makes a difference with this traditional Italian bread . The inside stays soft even after sitting out, and you still get those crispy edges that everyone loves about good homemade focaccia .

It’s pretty much the kind of food that doesn’t need a lot of fuss and goes with almost anything.

Add the dried yeast and sugar , then make a well in the center and add the mashed potatoes .
Pour the water in gradually while mixing with your hands to absorb it . Once you have a smooth and homogeneous mixture, add the salt and work it in uniformly.

Cover the dough with a bowl and let it rest for 30 minutes , then repeat a set of folds. Flip the dough again, round it off, and place it in an oiled bowl . Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise away from drafts for about 3 hours or until it doubles in volume .
After the rising time, pour the dough into an oiled 12x16 inch pan . Stretch the dough gently with oiled hands and let it rest for another hour. Meanwhile, clean and slice the onions into thin rings .
After this time, pour the oil over the focaccia and press your fingertips into the dough to create the usual dimples , then add coarse salt .
Spread the onion rings evenly over the surface , then add the olives and drizzle with a little more oil. Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 30 minutes. When it's nicely golden, remove from the oven and enjoy your Apulian focaccia with onions !
