Smoked risotto , or risotto affumicato , is a real treat from the Northern Italian mountains. Seriously good stuff. People there, they really know how to make simple food taste amazing. And look, in those Alpine areas, using smoked ingredients is just part of life. So dishes like this are packed with all sorts of aromatic flavors you just don’t get from regular rice. Thing is, this version starts with chopped spring onion and some crispy smoked pancetta. That rich, woodsy smell? Yeah, it just drifts through the kitchen. Once the rice gets toasted, it soaks up that smoky goodness, and by the end, with a chunk of smoked scamorza cheese , you've got a super creamy risotto . It’s got a tender bite and a nice, savory kick.
This smoked cheese risotto isn’t about fancy steps or tricky stuff. Just good, old Italian mountain cooking focusing on what tastes really really great together. It’s not as heavy as some versions you might find with seafood, like a smoked haddock risotto . For sure. But it’s got those rich, golden flavors that make you grab another spoonful. Folks there use whatever smoked cheese they can find. So if you swap in something like smoked gouda, you’ll get a pretty good smoked gouda risotto too. The main thing is how the cheese melts in, turning the rice moist and making each bite stick-to-your-ribs good. This dish is like a warm hug after a long day out in the cold, and, honestly, it’s no wonder people keep coming back for more. You don’t have to be in the Alps to enjoy it—bring those smoky, savory flavors together and you’ve got a real taste of Italian mountain tradition right at home.
What makes this risotto special? It captures the spirit of Northern Italy's culinary heritage. With simple, high-quality ingredients and a focus on robust flavors, it’s a meal that tells a story of tradition and comfort. Whether you're enjoying it by a cozy fire or at a family dinner, risotto affumicato offers a slice of the beautiful Alpine lifestyle, no matter where you are. Pretty much.
To prepare the smoked risotto, clean and finely chop the scallions, then let them soften in a pan over low heat with the extra virgin olive oil and butter. Cut the smoked bacon into small pieces , add it to the scallions , and let it brown and flavor for a couple of minutes.
Add the rice , toast it for a few minutes, stirring frequently to prevent it from sticking , then add 2-3 ladles of vegetable broth . Continue cooking for 15 minutes, adding broth when the rice begins to dry out.
Meanwhile, cut the smoked provola cheese into cubes and, when almost cooked, add it to the rice , adjust the salt and pepper , then stir to combine all the ingredients. Your smoked risotto is ready: plate it and serve while it's hot.
You can store the smoked risotto in the refrigerator, sealed in an airtight container, for a maximum of 1-2 days. An excellent way to enjoy any leftover risotto is to prepare it as "riso al salto," following the instructions you can find Rice to be skipped
