To prepare the shrimps in kataifi pastry with apricot jam sauce, start by cleaning the shrimps: you should leave the head and tail intact, then gently detach the carapace from the shrimps , then cut the back with a small knife and remove the intestine . Salt and pepper the shrimps , sprinkle them with thyme leaves
then skewer them with a toothpick (4-5): this way you will be able to wrap the shrimps more easily with the kataifi pastry and they will hold their shape during cooking. Now take the kataifi pastry (available frozen in supermarkets, so you should thaw it in the fridge before use); shred it with your hands to spread out the strands.
Then wrap each shrimp starting from the head, up to the tail to cover the entire central part (7-8). Fry a few shrimps at a time in plenty of hot seed oil, for about 3 minutes (the temperature should not exceed 338-356°F) ; when they are golden, drain them with a slotted spoon
Then salt and pepper the salad to taste, then prepare a citronette: pour the olive oil into a small bowl, add the juice of half a squeezed lemon , the chopped mint leaves, and emulsify everything , then season the mixed salad greens.
Distribute it on the serving plates , also season with apricot jam around the salad and place three shrimps per portion : your shrimps in kataifi pastry with apricot jam sauce are ready to be enjoyed !
It is preferable to consume the shrimps in kataifi pastry with apricot jam sauce as soon as they are ready. They can also be eaten cold.
