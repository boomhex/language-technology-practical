instructions:
To prepare the gluten-free cake, pour the eggs and sugar into a large bowl . Using electric beaters, beat the eggs with the sugar until you get a well-whipped mixture. When it is light and frothy, add the seed oil slowly, continuing to work with the electric beaters .
Add the vanilla extract , grated lemon zest , and a pinch of salt .
Work again for a few seconds . Sift the rice flour and baking powder into the batter.
Mix with a hand whisk from the bottom up with slow and precise movements . Also, add the sifted potato starch and almond flour .
Mix with a hand whisk to fully incorporate the powders, until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous batter . Transfer the mixture to an 8-inch diameter pan lined with parchment paper or greased and floured with rice flour .
At this point, bake in a static oven at 350°F for 45-50 minutes . Always do the toothpick test before removing the cake from the oven . Let it cool slightly, then remove your gluten-free cake and sprinkle with powdered sugar !
The gluten-free cake can be stored under a glass dome for 2-3 days.
Alternatively, you can freeze it, perhaps already cut into slices.
If you prefer, you can substitute almond flour with the same amount of hazelnut or pistachio flour.
