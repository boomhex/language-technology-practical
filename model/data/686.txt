instructions:
To prepare the braised beef with Buttafuoco, first remove the excess fat and sinew from the chuck roast and proceed with tying it to give it a regular shape: tie the meat lengthwise with kitchen twine, then create a loop and pass the meat through it. Continue in this way, spacing the loops a couple of inches apart until you create a cage that you secure with a double knot .
Move on to the vegetables: after cleaning them, cut the garlic and onion into fairly large pieces , then coarsely chop the carrot and celery .
Pour all the vegetables into a very large bowl along with the juniper berries and cloves , then add the bay leaves and marjoram leaves .
Place the meat in the bowl and pour the wine to completely cover it . Cover with plastic wrap and let it marinate for half a day, or overnight, in the refrigerator, turning the meat a couple of times.
After this time, take the meat out of the marinade , dry it and place it in a baking pan, then salt it and flour it well on all sides .
Brown the floured meat in a pan with a drizzle of oil , turning it on all sides with tongs to seal it well and avoid piercing it . Set the browned meat aside and drain the marinade vegetables, filtering the liquid and setting it aside .
Meanwhile, soak the dried mushrooms in water for about 30 minutes . In a large saucepan, melt the butter in the oil , then add the marinade vegetables .
Cook the vegetables with a little water, which should simmer briskly . Then add the meat and the soaked mushrooms .
Add the tomato paste and the roughly chopped fresh tomatoes , then turn the meat with kitchen tongs .
At this point, pour in the marinade wine : the meat should be covered two-thirds. Cover with a lid and cook over moderate heat for 3 hours. Occasionally baste the meat on the surface and check that it does not stick to the bottom, making sure the liquid is always boiling.
After the cooking time, remove the meat from the saucepan and place it on a sheet of aluminum foil that you have previously buttered . Keep the meat in the parcel to keep it warm and prevent it from drying out .
Also take out the vegetables and pass them through a food mill to remove the fibers , then blend the mixture with an immersion blender through a chinois sieve to make the sauce more refined. Pour the sauce back into the saucepan and reduce it on the stove. Now take the braised beef and remove the twine, then cut it into slices .
Transfer the slices of meat to a serving platter and cover with the prepared sauce . Your braised beef with Buttafuoco is ready to be served !
The braised beef with Buttafuoco can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, preferably covered with the sauce.
If you have the possibility to cook in a low-temperature oven, place the meat in the oven at 181°F for 12 hours: this way the braised beef will be even more flavorful and aromatic.
Tying the meat is essential because it allows for even cooking; skipping this step will cause the meat juices to swell with heat, as happens in stews or boiled dishes.
It is better to chop the vegetables coarsely because this way they will release more flavor into the cooking base.
The flour also acts as a thickener for the sauce: for a gluten-free version, you can avoid flouring the meat and add a little cornstarch mixed with water to the sauce.
Do not discard the gelatinous filament found in the central part of the braised beef! It is the best part that makes the meat tender and succulent!
