When it comes to summer dishes, stuffed avocado is a fresh twist. Picture this: you slice open a ripe avocado and fill it with its own creamy pulp, juicy beef heart tomato, and tender shrimp. Really, really tasty. This combo of buttery avocado, sweet tomato chunks, and a hint of seafood makes every bite so refreshing. Add a touch of honey and a splash of citrus—bam!—the whole dish lights up with tangy vibes. Honestly, it's like a bite of sunshine.
And here's the thing: it is one of those avocado recipes that stands out. With bright colors and a fresh aroma that fills the kitchen, it's hard to resist. People love experimenting with herbs or a bit of chopped chili. Why? To tweak the flavors. So... Each batch is a bit unique. Depends on what feels right that day.
When the heat is on and turning on the stove sounds unbearable, healthy stuffed avocado is your perfect go-to. For real, it’s replacing heavier options like pasta salad or fried foods. It feels lighter and brighter. You might find it served as keto stuffed avocado or even in a vegetarian version by skipping the shrimp and adding more veggies or beans. The crispy veggies or seafood mixed with that creamy base gives you a bit of everything. And it’s super easy. Whip it up for a quick lunch or a casual get-together.
Plus, the fun part is you don't have to stick to one style; some folks even try baked versions or fill theirs with different ingredients. Which is great. Makes it one of those versatile avocado meal ideas that keeps things interesting all summer long. For anyone who enjoys a mix of sweet and savory, this stuffed avocado is sure to be a crowd-pleaser at any table. Can't go wrong.
To prepare the stuffed avocado, start with marinating the shrimp. First, make an incision along the back with a blade and use it to remove the intestine, which is the black and bitter filament inside . Place the shrimp in a container and add flavor by grating the zest of half a lemon .
Then pour in the soy sauce and honey , briefly mix with a spoon, and finally cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes in the refrigerator .
In the meantime, prepare the filling. Grate the zest of the other half of the lemon and collect it in a small container , then squeeze the juice and strain it to remove any pulp and seeds .
Wash and dry the oxheart tomatoes, slice them, and then cut them into cubes about 1 cm (0.39 inches) in size and set them aside . Move on to cutting the avocados, making a lengthwise incision with a blade and then separating the two halves by simply twisting your hands in opposite directions .
Remove the large seed in the center: simply hit it with a sharp blade and extract it (be very careful when detaching it) . Then scoop out the flesh using a melon baller, or if you don't have one, you can use a teaspoon, and be careful not to damage it as it will serve as a container . Chop the obtained pulp and place it in a bowl .
Add the lemon zest and juice to prevent it from oxidizing , drizzle with oil , and finally add the tomato cubes along with a pinch of salt and pepper and the chopped mint . Mix everything and set aside for a moment.
In a pan, place the almond slices and toast them for a couple of minutes on high heat, stirring often to prevent burning . Finally, take the shrimp and place them in another pan .
Cook them on high heat for 1 minute . Begin filling the avocados with the mixture then garnish with 4 shrimp per piece .
the almond slices , a sprig of mint , and your stuffed avocado is ready, repeat for all the others. Serve your stuffed avocado immediately !
It is recommended to consume the stuffed avocado immediately. If you wish to store it, you can do so for up to one day, keeping it in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap. Freezing is not recommended.
If you don't prefer shrimp, you can always opt for tuna or cubes of swordfish or salmon seared in a pan! Or you could try adding some fresh cheese. For a vegan version, use tofu cubes or pre-cooked chickpeas sautéed in a pan and flavored with spices. Finally, instead of almonds, try garnishing with cashews or pistachios.
