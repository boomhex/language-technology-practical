Torta dolce di zucchine is a delightful Italian dessert that really shakes up the veggie-in-desserts game. I mean, instead of being a savory side dish, zucchine become the star of this moist zucchini cake —so so tender on the inside. Across Italy, especially in home kitchens, there's this awesome tradition of sneaking garden veggies into sweets. Seriously good stuff. You might find this cake right next to the classic torta 7 vasetti, but here's the thing—it’s got a twist. The zucchine’s mild flavor and high water content make everything extra moist and almost melt-in-your-mouth soft. It's not like those heavier, dense breads you find in American zucchini bread ; this is more of a gentle, almost delicate cake—perfect with a morning coffee or as an afternoon snack.
What really really makes this zucchini cake a standout in Italian kitchens is how it transforms a simple vegetable into something special. It might look plain at first, but each bite gives you a subtle sweet taste with a hint of garden freshness. Some folks like a sprinkle of powdered sugar or a light glaze, but to be honest, it’s pretty great on its own—especially when it’s still a bit warm from the oven. I gotta say, you can really feel how moist it is.
Italian families, they love keeping things simple, so this easy zucchini cake recipe is what you make when you’ve got zucchine galore or when you crave a snack that's not too heavy or rich. For sure. If you're into a homemade zucchini cake that’s quick, not overly sweet, and feels a tad healthier than most desserts, this is your gem. Plus, if you’re after those best zucchini bread vibes but in a lighter, more delicate form, this cake hits the spot. It's a sweet twist on tradition that makes zucchine feel right at home in dessert. Whether you’re sharing with friends or savoring a slice alone, it’s a treat that showcases the inventive spirit of Italian baking. And the sauce? Not needed—it's a winner as is.
To prepare the sweet zucchini cake, start by washing the zucchini, removing the ends, and grating them with a large-hole grater ; then squeeze them slightly to remove excess water. Beat the whole eggs with the sugar until you get a light and frothy mixture ,
then add the all-purpose flour, hazelnut (or almond) flour, and well-sifted baking powder, then also the seeds from the vanilla bean . Also add the vegetable oil , mixing well to combine it, and finally the grated zucchini .
Mix everything and pour the mixture into a 9.5/10-inch buttered and floured cake pan (or lined with parchment paper) (7-8). Bake the zucchini cake for about 60 minutes at 356°F (static oven), checking with a skewer to ensure it's cooked before removing it from the oven. If it darkens too much on the surface after the first 40 minutes, cover it with a sheet of aluminum foil. Let the sweet zucchini cake cool before removing it from the mold. Serve it dusted with powdered sugar!
