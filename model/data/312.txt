To prepare the cauliflower fritters, first place the steamed florets in a bowl and mash them with a fork . Then add the Parmesan and salt .
Add the pepper , eggs, and flour , and mix until you obtain a homogeneous mixture .
In a non-stick pan, heat the oil, take 3-4 tablespoons of the mixture, and place them in the pan . Cook over medium heat for 2 minutes on each side or until golden . The cauliflower fritters are ready to be served, perhaps accompanied by a yogurt sauce .
Cauliflower fritters express their full flavor when they are freshly made, hot, and fragrant. But if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator in a closed container for 1-2 days.
You can also bake the cauliflower fritters in the oven by placing them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and drizzling them with a bit of oil. Bake at 390°F for about 15-20 minutes, turning them halfway through cooking. You can customize the fritters by adding spices or herbs to the batter, such as paprika, nutmeg, turmeric, parsley, or thyme.
