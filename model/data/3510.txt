To prepare the aromatic chicken sticks, start by chopping the bread crumbs in a blender and separately 400 grams (about 14 oz) of chicken breast , set them aside. Then remove the seeds from the fresh chilies
and trim the ends of the lemongrass sticks . Finely chop them in a blender with ginger and mint and coriander leaves . Wash the green onions and finely chop them with a sharp knife. In a bowl, put the minced chicken and incorporate the green onions ,
the mixture of spices and herbs , the egg that you have previously beaten , and the bread crumbs processed in the blender. Mix the ingredients well and finally adjust the salt.
With wet hands (keep a bowl of warm water at hand), make small cylinders with the mixture, place them on a plate and slightly flatten them with your fingers , obtaining the shape of small bricks. Place the sticks in the fridge for 10/15 minutes . Heat a griddle/pan over medium heat, place the chicken sticks on it and cook them for about 10 minutes, turning them often to prevent sticking. Optionally, lightly grease the pan with some oil. Serve the aromatic chicken sticks with toothpicks as an appetizer, accompanied by yogurt sauce, soy sauce, or sweet chili sauce.
