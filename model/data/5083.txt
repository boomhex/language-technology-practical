To make the eggless mascarpone cream, place the mascarpone in a bowl , flavor it with grated orange zest , then season with Grand Marnier liqueur and mix with a whisk to soften the cream.
In another bowl, pour the fresh liquid cream, and with an electric mixer or a stand mixer, start whipping the cream (4-5); when it is semi-whipped, gradually add the powdered sugar
continue beating until it becomes fluffy . At this point, combine the cream with the mascarpone, gently mix the two mixtures with a spatula to avoid deflating the cream. Your eggless mascarpone cream is ready to be spread on delicious slices of Panettone or Pandoro!
