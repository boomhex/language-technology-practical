instructions:
Looking to spice up your snack routine? Well, the poke temaki wrap is where it is at. Seriously good. This dish is a fun fusion—mixing flavors from Emilia-Romagna, Italy, and Hawaiian-Japanese cuisine. It starts with a soft piadina, which is kinda like a tortilla but a bit more tender. You take ahi tuna, marinate it in soy sauce with a hint of chili, then throw in some guacamole for that extra punch. Really, it's all about that punch. And the sauce? The creamy crescenza cheese, an Italian favorite, just rounds out the whole flavor profile. It's more original than your typical sushi wrap or poke wrap . Pretty much. Picture a temaki hand roll —usually wrapped in seaweed—but here, it's the Italian bread keeping everything together in a big, moist cone.
The flavor combo is something you really don’t find every day. You bite into the crisp edge of the piadina and get a tangy burst from the tuna and chili. Then, the rich, creamy crescenza and silky avocado just take over. For real. It’s like a hand-rolled sushi with a surprise Italian twist. Thanks to the piadina and cheese, it’s perfect. In Italy, you might see this at an aperitivo—a casual snack time with friends, plus drinks and laughs. The colorful filling and cone shape are show-stoppers. Also, it's easy to hold, so everyone can grab one while mingling. Fans of a good temaki hand roll or a creative sushi wrap will totally dig this blend of flavors with Italian favorites. It doesn’t take itself too seriously and is great for parties or whenever you're craving something playful, savory, and a bit unexpected. Imagine a poke wrap meeting a classic Italian piadina—they team up to bring the ultimate party food. It’s a mash-up that's sure to impress and satisfy at any gathering. Really really good.
To prepare the poke temaki wrap, take the chili pepper and remove the stem. Then remove the seeds inside and chop it . Finely chop the green part of the scallion as well .
Take the fresh tuna (make sure it has been flash-frozen upon purchase and follow the instructions at the end of the recipe for proper use and consumption of raw fish); first cut it into strips , then into 3/4-inch cubes , and place them in a small bowl. Dress with sesame oil ,
soy sauce , rice vinegar , chili pepper ;
also add the green part of the scallion and mix , cover with plastic wrap and let it marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Once the indicated time has passed, take it out and let it sit at room temperature for about half an hour.
In the meantime, prepare the guacamole: cut the avocado in half, remove the pit and scoop out the flesh with a spoon . Squeeze the juice of one lime
and drizzle the avocado flesh with the juice obtained . Then peel and chop the shallot , wash and finely chop the vine tomato
and finally trim and chop the green chili pepper . Pour all the ingredients into the bowl with the avocado (20-21),
season with the oil , then mash and mix everything together : your guacamole is ready .
Cut the two flatbreads in half , heat them in a pan for about 2 minutes , then take the crescenza cheese and spread it over the entire surface of the half flatbread .
