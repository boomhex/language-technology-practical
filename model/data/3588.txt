To prepare the Australian lamingtons, first melt the butter over low heat and once ready, let it cool slightly. Then prepare the batter: beat the eggs with the sugar in a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment for at least 10 minutes at medium speed (if you don't have a stand mixer you can use an electric mixer), then add the melted, slightly cooled butter and continue beating until you obtain a very frothy and pale mixture
In a large bowl, sift the flour with the baking powder , slit a vanilla bean with a knife and extract the seeds; add the sifted flour with baking powder and the vanilla bean seeds to the mixture and gently mix with a spatula or a whisk
Butter and flour a 12x9 inch rectangular pan and pour in the batter . Bake in a preheated oven at 356°F for 30 minutes (320°F for 20 minutes if using a fan oven). Once ready, you can remove the base from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about ten minutes and then remove it from the pan to let it cool completely, which will take about a couple of hours . In the meantime, heat the cream in a saucepan. Then coarsely chop the dark chocolate
and melt it in a double boiler ; when it's melted, add the hot cream gradually , stir, and keep the melted chocolate warm to prevent it from thickening
Cut the base into 1.5x1.5 inch squares , cut each square horizontally obtaining 35 pieces. Fill the base with red currant jam. Then cover with the other half of the square
Pour the coconut flour into a bowl. Take one square at a time, dip it in the melted chocolate so that it is well coated and let the excess chocolate drip off. Roll it in the coconut well so that it is completely covered and remove the excess coating. Proceed the same way until you run out of lamingtons, let them rest in a cool place on a wire rack (or on a tray lined with parchment paper) so that the chocolate and coconut coating can set . Your lamingtons are ready to be served and enjoyed!
Store the lamingtons in an airtight container in the fridge for 2-3 days. They can be frozen but only filled. You can glaze them and cover them with coconut once thawed
It would be ideal to prepare the base of the dessert a day in advance so that when cutting it is well cold and firm, which does not happen if it is still hot or just taken out of the oven
Legend has it that the first time these treats were served was on a day when the governor brought his staff to a holiday home to avoid the excessive heat of Brisbane: the cook, caught off guard because he was not expecting guests and informed at the last moment, decided to cut a sponge cake from the previous day into small squares, dip them in melted chocolate and then roll them in coconut flakes he had available. The dessert was so well liked that Lord Lamington's guests even asked for the recipe.
