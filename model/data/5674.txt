instructions:
Soy sauce chicken is a main course with a bold character and an oriental flavor, perfect for bringing an exotic touch to the table without complications. It is a recipe that transforms a simple chicken breast into something special, thanks to the fragrant marinade and the glaze that forms during cooking due to the soy sauce and honey that caramelizes. Another great advantage of this preparation is its versatility: you can pair it with simple basmati rice to stay true to oriental atmospheres, or accompany it with stir-fried vegetables for a balanced one-dish meal. You can prepare it for a casual dinner with friends, but it also works great as a tasty alternative to the usual everyday main courses.
