instructions:
To make the chicken curry with apples, first clean the onion and slice it , then peel the fresh ginger and chop it . Wash and cut the apple into irregular pieces of about 3/4 inch, keeping the skin .
Pour a drizzle of oil into a saucepan, add the onion , a clove of garlic, and the ginger and sauté over low heat. When the onion is soft enough, increase the heat and sear the chicken pieces .
Turn the chicken to brown it well on all sides and then remove the garlic . Add the apple pieces and mix everything together. Continue cooking, meanwhile in a bowl combine the yogurt, chili powder ,
the curry and fresh cream . Stir to blend the sauce .
Once the chicken is slightly golden, pour in the spice sauce , salt , and add the water
and cook with the lid on for at least 20 minutes over medium heat (shaking the saucepan occasionally to prevent the chicken from sticking to the bottom). After twenty minutes, remove the lid and continue cooking for another 10/12 minutes. After this time, add the chopped parsley and the chicken curry with apples will be ready, serve it hot !
Chicken curry with apples can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Freezing is not recommended.
To make the sauce, you can also use curry paste and for a stronger taste, replace parsley with cilantro.
