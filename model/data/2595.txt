To prepare the stuffed squid with Swiss chard, raisins, and almonds, coarsely chop the Swiss chard , then rinse it under running water and drain it. Let it wilt in a pan, cooking over medium heat with the lid on for 10 minutes or until tender,
season with olive oil , flavor with the raisins previously soaked in water and well drained. Deglaze with 1/4 cup of soy sauce
add the sliced almonds . Turn off the heat and remove some of the cooked Swiss chard, just enough to accompany the squid, and set it aside so it retains a bright green color. Attend to the cleaning of the squid: rinse them under running water, and remove the outer skin , then gently detach the head from the mantle with your hands and set it aside.
Once the head is removed, still with your hands, locate the transparent cartilage pen inside the mantle and gently extract it. Rinse the squid under running water, wash it, and remove the insides from the mantle. Stuff the squid with the Swiss chard sautéed in the pan , then close by securing the tentacles to the mantle with a toothpick . As you assemble the squid, place them in the pan with the remaining Swiss chard, add a drizzle of olive oil, the water , deglaze with 1/4 cup of soy sauce,
cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes until tender . Place the reserved Swiss chard on serving plates and lay the squid on top. Serve the stuffed squid with Swiss chard, raisins, and almonds piping hot .
It's recommended to consume the squid immediately; if there are leftovers, store them in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. You can freeze them only if you have used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
