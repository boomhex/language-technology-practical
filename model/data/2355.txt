The croque baguette is a fresh twist on the classic French croque monsieur , perfect for when you need a tasty snack on the go. Imagine that crispy baguette, often seen tucked under an arm as someone leaves a Parisian boulangerie. And here's the thing: instead of the usual sandwich bread, this version uses the French loaf, loaded with creamy besciamella, plenty of melted groviera cheese, and smoky pancetta cubes. The result? A golden, satisfying bite that’s way more exciting than a typical ham and cheese sandwich.
This croque monsieur baguette brings all the flavors you love, but in a portable, hearty package that feels like street food with a French flair. You know, people in Paris often grab one for a quick lunch or a late afternoon snack, giving you that French street vibe right in your kitchen.
Pretty much, this kind of snack is perfect for when friends drop by unexpectedly or when you need something quick that still feels special. The rich, tender mix of cheese and pancetta contrasts beautifully with the crunchy crust. Seriously, the croque baguette is just as fitting for an impromptu gathering as it is for a laid-back dinner, letting you share some classic French cuisine with your friends.
Some folks even top it with an egg—transforming it into a croque madame baguette —which is great when you want something more filling. It’s one of those easy French recipes where the flavors come together quickly, yet you still get that savory, comforting feeling. Really really tasty. Swapping out basic bread for a moist baguette really sets this baked baguette sandwich apart, infusing each bite with that unmistakable French taste. It’s the kind of food that reminds you of small Paris cafés and the simple, relaxed enjoyment of good flavors, wherever you are.
Whether for a meal or a snack, this dish offers a great way to savor a piece of France. Cannot go wrong.
To prepare the croque baguette, start by making the béchamel. Heat the milk, without bringing it to a boil. In a saucepan, melt the butter and then add the flour , stirring quickly for a couple of minutes .
When the roux has reached a golden color, add the warm milk and stir over medium heat, adding the salt and nutmeg .
Continue stirring until your béchamel has thickened, then transfer it to a bowl . Take the bacon and cut it into small strips .
Grate the Gruyère into julienne strips and set everything aside. Take the baguettes, cut them in half lengthwise , as if to fill them, and remove the internal crumb .
Repeat this process for both halves of the baguettes , and fill the cavities created with the béchamel . Cover with plenty of Gruyère ,
and also add the bacon strips . Bake your croque baguette in a preheated static oven at 482°F for about 4 minutes (if using a convection oven, bake at 446°F for 2-3 minutes), until the Gruyère has melted and the bacon is crispy. Serve the croque baguette hot .
Consume your croque baguette while still hot, alternatively, you can store them in the refrigerator for up to one day.
To make your croque baguette, you can also use a cheese like Emmental or Fontina. If you prefer, you can replace the bacon with diced speck or ham.
