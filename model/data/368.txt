To prepare lime and mint chicken, first wash the lime well and slice it . Then peel the garlic and slice it .
Place the chicken pieces in a baking dish , add the lime slices on top , and the mint leaves .
Season with salt , add the garlic , and drizzle with some olive oil .
Mix with your hands and cover with plastic wrap . Let it marinate for 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Then bake in a fan oven, preheated to 350°F, for about 1 hour. When it's nicely golden, take the chicken out of the oven .
It's time to plate. Transfer the chicken pieces to a serving dish, add more mint leaves, tearing them by hand , pour the cooking juices over , and serve .
We recommend consuming the chicken immediately. Alternatively, you can store it in an airtight container and reheat it before serving.
You can use lemon instead of lime.
You can increase the marinating time if you prefer a more intense flavor.
