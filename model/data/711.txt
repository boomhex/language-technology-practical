instructions:
To prepare the latkes, peel the potatoes and grate them using a grater with large holes . Place the grated potatoes in a sieve placed over a bowl and let them rest for 10-15 minutes : this way, they will lose their moisture and not turn black .
Transfer the potatoes to a bowl and add the egg , salt, pepper , and nutmeg .
Finally, add the flour and mix everything with a spoon . Pour about 1 inch of extra virgin olive oil into a saucepan and bring it to a temperature of 340°F, then add a few spoonfuls of the mixture at a time .
Fry for 3-4 minutes in total, turning the pancakes on both sides . When they are nicely golden, drain them on absorbent paper . Your latkes are ready to be served hot, accompanied by sour cream with dill !
It is recommended to consume the latkes immediately.
If you wish, you can enrich the latkes with onion: just grate it raw and add it to the potato mixture!
Traditionally, latkes are fried in extra virgin olive oil: however, if you prefer, you can use peanut oil instead.
