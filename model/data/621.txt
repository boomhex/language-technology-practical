instructions:
To prepare the pasta with asparagus and fontina, start by cleaning the asparagus. Break off the hard part of the stem , then use a vegetable peeler to peel the asparagus, leaving the top intact . Put all the peeled scraps in a small pot with 250 g (8.8 oz) of water , add the stems and let them simmer over medium heat: this way you'll get a quick broth that you will use to proceed with the recipe.
Cut the asparagus into rounds about 5 mm thick (0.2 inches) , leaving the tips intact ; then divide them in half lengthwise . Put a pot full of salted water on the stove, which will be used to cook the pasta.
In a non-stick pan, brown the clove of garlic in its skin and add the asparagus rounds and tips . Sauté them for a few minutes on high heat .
Now take a ladleful of the asparagus broth and pour it into the pan . Continue this way until they are cooked. Add salt and pepper, and remove the garlic .
As soon as the water starts to boil, add the tortiglioni and cook them for a couple of minutes less than the time indicated on the package. Cut the fontina into pieces and put it in a small pot with the milk .
Turn on the heat to the lowest setting (don't rush to melt the fontina, or it might curdle and not melt anymore). Stir with a whisk until everything is combined . Add a ladle of asparagus broth , stir again, and set aside.
Drain the pasta al dente directly into the pan and toss it to combine with the sauce, adding a ladle of cooking water if necessary . Once ready, turn off the heat and add the fondue .
Mix well , add a pinch of pepper, and the grated Parmesan cheese , and mix again. If it turns out too thick, add a little more cooking water. Serve the pasta with asparagus and fontina immediately !
We recommend consuming the pasta immediately; alternatively, it can be stored in the fridge for 1-2 days in an airtight container.
Thoroughly clean the asparagus with a vegetable peeler; otherwise, the stems might be too tough: this way, both stems and tips will have the same consistency!
If the fondue curdles, we recommend blending it with an immersion mixer.
Instead of milk, you can also use cream for a creamier fondue.
Instead of fontina, you can also use toma, or another cheese with similar texture and aging.
