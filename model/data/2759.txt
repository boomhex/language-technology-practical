Involtini ripieni di asparagi really capture the heart of a spring meal in Northern and Central Italy, with places like Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany totally celebrating this dish. It's about those tender veal slices—wrapped around a fresh mix of asparagus and melty cheese. Pretty simple. Asparagus starts popping up at markets, and you get that nice crispy bite from the oven. The inside stays really moist and a bit tangy thanks to the lemon zest grated over the filling. And the zest? It wakes up the flavors. Really, it's perfect for sunny, easy lunches.
You'll find these secondi piatti con asparagi on Italian tables as soon as the weather warms up. It works just as well with chicken or even prosciutto if you want to mix things up. Which is great. What's awesome is that involtini di asparagi aren't just for special occasions—you know, people take them to work or on picnics. They're easy to pack and enjoy cold or hot. The ricetta involtini asparagi focuses on fresh, seasonal ingredients, so you might find different cheeses or a sprinkle of herbs depending on the region. Thing is, some families in the north opt for a sharper cheese for extra punch, while others in Umbria prefer it milder.
No matter the variation, you always get that soft, golden exterior and a sweet, earthy filling from the asparagus. This is one of those involtini facili e veloci that turns a simple lunch into something special. People often trade out veal for chicken or use a slice of ham, like in involtini di prosciutto e asparagi , but the mix of fresh, melty, and zesty flavors remains at the heart of this Italian favorite. I mean, it’s a dish that brings a little bit of Italian sunshine to your table—blending tradition with modern convenience—making it an ideal choice for both everyday meals and great gatherings.
To prepare the asparagus stuffed rolls, start right from the cleaning of the asparagus: wash them under running water , then pat them dry with a kitchen towel and use a vegetable peeler to remove the fibrous part of the stem ; then tie them with kitchen string and place them in the asparagus steamer basket .
Cook them leaving the tips exposed which will cook with steam (if you don't have an asparagus steamer, you can boil the asparagus horizontally in a wide pot). Once cooked, drain them and let them cool slightly then cut off the hardest part of the stem leaving the tips just a bit longer than the short side of the meat slices . Grate the zest of 1 lemon ,
then pound the meat between two sheets of parchment paper to make the veal slices thinner without breaking the fibers of the meat and obtain 8 rectangles to season with grated lemon zest , salt, and pepper to taste .
Place a bit of raspadura and two asparagus tips on each slice; then roll to form the roll and close it with a toothpick . Proceed in the same way until the ingredients are used up,
then place the asparagus stuffed rolls in a slightly oiled baking dish, then drizzle a little oil on them as well and cook them in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 7-8 minutes (320°F for about 4-5 minutes if a fan oven). Once cooked, remove them from the oven and serve them hot or warm !
Store the asparagus stuffed rolls for 1-2 days in the refrigerator, closed in an airtight container. You can freeze them if you have used all fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
If you prefer, you can use thin slices of provola cheese for the filling and serve the asparagus rolls with a Parmigiano Cream .
