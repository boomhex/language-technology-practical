Bicchierini con crema di yogurt is such a fun way to enjoy a Greek-inspired dessert. These little cups mix bicchierini con crema di yogurt , confettura di fragole , and biscotti sablè al cacao for a really refreshing combo. So here's the thing, you get a creamy base from Greek yogurt with a touch of tanginess—really really good—with the sweetness of strawberry jam. This combo works because the yogurt isn’t overly rich, and the jam keeps it light. In Greece, thick yogurt is a staple in desserts, and here, it’s taken up a notch with playful textures. Pretty simple. Those cocoa sable biscuits are shaped like spoons, a nod to buttery French cookies, but with a crunchy twist that's just perfect.
These treats are often served as a dessert al cucchiaio , where you can savor all the layers in one bite. Scoop it up with the chocolate spoon—fun, right?—for an added surprise. The biscotti sablè al cacao add a nice crunch, pairing well with the soft, moist yogurt and the shiny, golden layer of jam. This type of dolci monoporzione feels special, yet it's actually a ricetta facile dessert you can whip up without much hassle.
Truthfully, it’s a fresh take on the classic dolce con yogurt e fragole, and using Greek yogurt gives it that authentic touch. In Greece, similar treats are a popular way to end a meal, especially when it's warm and you want something refreshing but not too filling. And the spoon-shaped cookies? They add a playful element—seriously good—and are sure to bring a smile to anyone at the table. All in all, these bicchierini con crema di yogurt combine fresh flavors, a bit of crunch, and a fun look, making them perfect for when you want a dolce veloce con yogurt that’s as tasty as it is beautiful.
To make the glasses with yogurt cream, strawberry jam, and cocoa sable cookies, start by preparing the cocoa sable dough. Place 2 egg yolks in a large bowl with sugar and a pinch of salt . Mix with an electric mixer and then add the room-temperature butter cut into small pieces ;
keep mixing until you obtain a light and fluffy mixture . In a separate container, pour the flour and sifted baking powder .
Add the cocoa powder and mix with a teaspoon . Pour everything into the egg mixture, mixing with the electric mixer , then knead by hand to gather all the ingredients.
When you have obtained a compact and smooth dough, transfer it to a work surface: shape it into a loaf and flatten it slightly with your fingers ; cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes, until it is firm. Meanwhile, prepare the yogurt cream; split a vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds .
In a large bowl, place the Greek yogurt and the seeds of the bean , mixing well with a spatula so that the seeds are evenly distributed and release their aroma . Place the cream you obtained in a piping bag without a tip, to which you can make a hole, and store in the refrigerator until ready to use.
After the necessary time, roll out the dough on a floured work surface using a rolling pin (or between two sheets of parchment paper), creating a sheet about 0.2 inches thick. Cut the dough with a slightly floured cookie cutter in the shape of a spoon : with these doses you should get 16 cookies ; distribute the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake them in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 10 minutes (or in a convection oven at 320°F for 8 minutes).
Once baking is complete, take out the sable spoon cookies , letting them cool completely on a wire rack. Once the yogurt cream has set, remove it from the refrigerator and compose the desserts: distribute the cream in 4 serving glasses with a capacity of 80 ml , then crumble some of the cocoa cookies and distribute them on the cream to make the dessert more delicious and crunchy;
place the strawberry jam in a piping bag without a tip, to which you make a hole, and continue by alternating the jam with the other ingredients . Repeat the operation to create another layer, then finish with a zig-zag decoration, adding some cookie crumbs and a mint leaf . Finally, accompany each glass with the spoon-shaped cookies: your glasses with yogurt cream, strawberry jam, and cocoa sable cookies are ready to be served .
You can store the glass with yogurt cream and strawberry jam in the refrigerator for up to a couple of days. You can prepare the cookies in advance and store them in a tin box for 3-4 days. You can freeze the cocoa shortcrust pastry dough and thaw it in the refrigerator when needed.
Fresh, delicious, and inviting: these glasses are truly an irresistible dessert! If you like, you can also try crumbling regular dry cookies, alternating them with the cocoa sable dough: layer by layer, you will be enchanted by the goodness of these small delights!
