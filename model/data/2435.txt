instructions:
To prepare the mortadella puffs, start by making the filling. Finely chop both the mortadella and the cheese with a knife. Then take the pastry and slightly flatten it with a rolling pin .
From this, first cut 4 strips about 3x10 inches , and then cut from these strips rectangles about 3x3.5 inches (5-6).
Place 1 teaspoon of cheese and 1 teaspoon of mortadella , previously chopped, in the center of each rectangle. Then brush the edges of the rectangle with the slightly beaten egg yolk .
At this point, fold them into a triangle shape, applying slight pressure with your fingers . Again, brush the edges and the center of the triangles with the egg and add pistachio crumbles to decorate your mortadella puffs .
Bake in a preheated oven at 355°F for 15 minutes , ensuring you cover them with aluminum foil to prevent the pistachio crumbles from darkening too much . Serve the mortadella puffs freshly prepared, or even at room temperature !
Mortadella puffs are best consumed freshly made. Alternatively, they can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day. Freezing is not recommended.
Get creative by changing the shape of your puffs and fill them with a different filling, made with any type of cold cuts or cheese!
