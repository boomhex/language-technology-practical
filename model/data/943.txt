instructions:
To prepare the chestnut ravioli, the first thing to do is to score the chestnuts with a small knife, making a cross . Arrange them on a baking sheet and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 35 minutes. They should be cooked but still crunchy. Meanwhile, prepare the fresh pasta. Pour the flour and eggs into a bowl .
Mix first with a fork , when the eggs have been absorbed by the flour, transfer to a wooden work surface and continue kneading by hand . Once smooth, form a dough ball and wrap it in plastic wrap . Let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Meanwhile, your chestnuts will be cooked; just take them out of the oven . Peel them carefully , you will need to get 12 oz. Set aside two or three for the final decoration and coarsely chop the others with a knife and transfer them to a large bowl.
Finely chop the rosemary leaves and add it to the chestnuts . Also add the ricotta ,
the grated Parmesan and mix until you get a homogeneous mixture. Taste, adjust with salt and pepper. The ravioli filling is ready .
As soon as the pasta resting time is over, cut it into 3 pieces . This will make it easier to roll out. You can do it by hand or use a pasta machine , you need to achieve a thickness of a few mm. Then transfer the sheet to a work surface
and fold it in half . Then unfold it, this way you will understand which half to fill and which to fold over the filling. Arrange small heaps of filling on the pasta in a row, spacing them apart , brush the side of the pasta without filling with the egg
and fold the pasta to cover the filling , trying to match the two halves well. Press with your fingers to release any air . At this point, use a 1.2-inch cutter to give the filling a round shape, pressing lightly, then use a 2.8-inch one to cut out your ravioli .
Gently press again with the smaller cutter and transfer the ravioli onto a tray dusted with flour. Keep the excess pasta covered and reuse it to make more ravioli. You will get about 40 in total. Next, move on to the sauce; cut the bresaola into thin strips and the toma into cubes , removing any crust.
Heat a little oil in a pan, add the bresaola and brown it for a few minutes. When crispy, lower the heat and pour in the milk , ensuring the pan is not too hot. Let it reduce for a few minutes, then turn off the heat. Add the toma
and mix well until the cheese melts . Cook the ravioli in boiling, salted water for 3-4 minutes. Turn the heat back on under the sauce pan and drain the ravioli directly into it . Add some cooking water if necessary and toss until creamy.
Turn off the heat again and finish the ravioli with butter . Transfer to plates, grate the reserved chestnuts on top and serve your ravioli !
