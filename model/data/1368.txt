instructions:
To make the potato plumcake, first boil the potatoes for 30-40 minutes, until they are tender ; cooking time may vary depending on the size of the potatoes. Once cooked, pass them through the potato masher while still hot to reduce them to puree . In a bowl, pour the flour, baking powder , and salt.
Also add the room temperature milk . Continue by pouring in the water and the eggs .
Work with electric beaters until the eggs are fully absorbed . At this point, add the cooled potato puree and season with thyme leaves and grated cheese .
Cut the smoked provola cheese into cubes about 0.4 inches and add it to the mixture . Mix and pour the batter into a greased and floured 10x4x2.75 inch plumcake mold, then level the surface with the back of a spoon .
Grease a small knife with olive oil and then score the center of the batter along its length : this will prevent the surface from cracking during baking. Cover with poppy seeds and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 60 minutes in the middle rack. Once baked, remove the potato plumcake from the oven, let it cool slightly, then unmold it to serve .
Store the potato plumcake at room temperature for 2 days. You can freeze it after baking.
As an alternative to poppy seeds, you can also use pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds.
