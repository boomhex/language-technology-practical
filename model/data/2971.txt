instructions:
To make the squid with olives, start by cleaning the squid following our cooking school guide: How to clean squid. Rinse the squid under running water , then gently detach the head from the body with your hands and set it aside . Also remove the transparent cartilage pen found in the body. Rinse the squid again under running water and remove the innards. Finally, remove the outer skin .
Now that your squid is clean, cut it into rings about half an inch thick . Chop the shallot, garlic, and parsley together . Heat the oil and butter in a pan ,
add the chopped shallot, parsley, and garlic , sauté for a few seconds, then add the squid and brown them for five minutes over medium heat. After five minutes, deglaze with white wine , let it evaporate,
add the tomato sauce , and finally add the black olives . Cook for about ten minutes over low heat, making sure the cooking liquid does not dry out too much; in this case, you could add a ladle of hot water. Adjust the salt
and pepper to finish the preparation. Your squid with olives is ready ; serve it with slices of toasted bread and enjoy it while hot .
You can store the squid with olives in the refrigerator for one day. It is possible to freeze the preparation if fresh fish was used.
This is an exceptional dish, for its taste, because it cooks in a flash, but also because it is very versatile. Don't like squid? Bring on the cuttlefish, sepia, or octopus! Do you find the taste of black olives too strong? Replace them with green ones! In other words: create your favorite version, then tell us about it :)
