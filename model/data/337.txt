instructions:
To prepare the pumpkin and goat cheese velouté, first remove the pumpkin skin and eliminate the seeds and inner fibers. Slice it into pieces and then into cubes .
Slice the shallot thinly . In a pot, heat the oil, add the shallot and the crushed unpeeled garlic .
Add the rosemary , sage and sauté for 2 minutes. Add the pumpkin and cook for 5-7 minutes over high heat, stirring often.
Adjust with salt and pepper . Pour in the vegetable broth , bring to a boil then lower the heat, cover with a lid , and let it cook for 20 minutes or until the pumpkin is tender.
Turn off the heat, remove the rosemary, sage, and garlic and add 14 oz of goat cheese . Blend with an immersion blender until smooth and homogeneous.
Plate the velouté . For each dish, create 3 small quenelles with the goat cheese using two teaspoons and place them on the velouté .
Finish with toasted pumpkin seeds and a drizzle of oil . Your pumpkin and goat cheese velouté is ready to be served .
The pumpkin and goat cheese velouté can be stored in the fridge, in a sealed container, for 2-3 days. Reheat it gently in a saucepan, adding some vegetable broth or water to restore its creamy consistency. If you want to store it longer, you can freeze it without the goat cheese: pour it into bags or food containers suitable for freezing. When you want to enjoy it, defrost it in the refrigerator and reheat it, adding the goat cheese and garnishes just before serving.
If you love spices, you can add a pinch of turmeric, freshly grated ginger, or a sprinkle of curry during cooking.
Instead of pumpkin seeds, try garnishing the velouté with chopped hazelnuts, almonds, or walnuts.
