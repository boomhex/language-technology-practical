instructions:
This chicken burger recipe really stands out by using chicken thighs instead of chicken breast. I mean, thigh meat has a bit more fat, making each bite super moist and tender. Fans of the classic homemade chicken burger love this trick because the patty ends up way juicier than the usual dry ones you sometimes get with chicken breast. Pretty simple, right? You can keep it simple and serve it as a main dish with a side salad, or stack it on a sandwich bun with all the good stuff—crispy bacon, melty cheese, fresh lettuce, and whatever sauces sound good. And here's the thing, some folks even like making their own buns for burger night at home, and it’s honestly a fun way to get everyone in the kitchen making their own burgers together. The best part—no question—is you can experiment with different toppings or swap in spicy sauces if you’re feeling like a spicy chicken burger twist.
This easy chicken burger works for all kinds of eaters, from picky kids to those who want a little extra flavor. Some like their ground chicken burger with a crispy outside, so pan-frying or grilling gives it that nice golden crust while keeping the inside super juicy. Others might want a healthier option, and using good chicken thighs really makes a difference—you end up with something satisfying that doesn’t taste bland. And you know what, there are so many regional spins on burgers, and this American-style version opens the door for mixing things up, whether it means adding a touch of smoky barbecue sauce or layering on spicy jalapeños for extra heat. Getting into a burger night routine lets everyone build their own sandwich just the way they want—maybe with some homemade nuggets on the side. With a chicken patty this good, it’s easy to see why the chicken sandwich keeps showing up on weeknight menus everywhere. People love how flexible and flavorful it is, and once you try making your own, it’s tough to go back to store-bought! Plus, the homemade touch brings everyone together—making meal times a fun and delicious event.

To prepare chicken burgers, first remove the skin from your thighs. Set aside one piece for the recipe. Insert the chicken thighs and the reserved skin into the mincer; it will add some fattiness to the burgers.
Gather the minced meat in a large bowl . If you don't have a mincer at home, you can ask the butcher to perform this operation. Then add the grated Grana Padano PDO, chopped rosemary , white wine ,
soy sauce , and mustard . Season with pepper and add a drizzle of oil .
Mix the ingredients until you get a homogeneous mixture . Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least half an hour ; this way, the flavors will blend, and the mixture will become firmer. After the resting time, start forming the burgers. First, line a cutting board with parchment paper, then take 6.3 oz of mixture and round it with your hands .
Then place it on the parchment paper and gently press to flatten it , then shape the burger with both hands to get the correct form . Prepare all the burgers this way; you will get 6 with these amounts. .
Now you just have to cook the burgers. Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan and place the burgers inside. Adjust the salt and cook over medium heat for 8-9 minutes. When they are nicely golden, flip them and continue cooking for another 8-9 minutes, being careful not to overcolor them . Adjust the salt again and serve your chicken burgers !
Once cooked, we recommend consuming the chicken burgers immediately, as reheating them might make them too dry.
You can store them in the fridge for 2 days, well wrapped in plastic wrap, or freeze them.
You can season your chicken burgers as you like. Instead of mustard, you can use barbecue sauce, and instead of soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce or herb salt. We used thighs because they are one of the fattier parts of the chicken; if you prefer to use the breast, consider that being very lean, it might result in a drier final product.
It is not advisable because minced meat has a different texture from blended meat, which turns into a mush.
Definitely, but you need to ensure that the cooking is done properly, especially in the middle.
Get a good non-stick pan, or you can place a sheet of parchment paper on the bottom.
