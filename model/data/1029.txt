instructions:
To prepare the sweet rice puff pastries, first work on the cream. In a saucepan, pour the almond milk, the rice , orange zest, lemon zest, and cinnamon . Stir and cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
In another saucepan, pour the egg yolks, sugar , cornstarch, and salt . Immediately mix with a whisk and set aside.
After 15 minutes , pour part of the mixture, trying to let only the milk flow and leaving the rice in the pot, into the egg yolk mixture . Mix with a whisk to combine .
Then add the remaining part . Stir again and return to the heat . Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring continuously, until a slight boil is reached .
Transfer the obtained cream into a baking dish . Cover with plastic wrap and let cool for an hour in the fridge. Once the cream is cold, unroll the puff pastry on a surface and cut 4 strips 3 inches wide . Place abundant cream in the center of each strip .
Using a fork, compact it, leaving half an inch free on both sides . Now lift both ends of the first strip and bring them towards the center to match them . Seal by pinching with fingers .
Seal the side edges by pinching with fingers as just done . Make sure each bundle is well closed before transferring it onto a baking sheet. Continue this way for the others. Brush just one half of the bundles with a little almond milk .
And sprinkle with sugar . Bake in a preheated fan oven at 356°F on the middle rack for 15 minutes. Once golden, take them out , let them cool down a bit, and serve .
The sweet rice puff pastries keep in the fridge for 3 days.
Instead of puff pastry, you can use a gluten-free puff pastry, making a dessert for those intolerant to gluten and lactose.
Instead of regular sugar, you can also use brown sugar for a more rustic taste.
