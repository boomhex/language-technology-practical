instructions:
To make the rice and apple fritters, first wash and cut the apples into cubes about 3/4 inch, without peeling them . Prepare the rice pudding: in a high-sided saucepan, add the milk, lemon zest , and sugar .
Add a pinch of salt and pour in the rice , then add the apples .
Cook over medium heat for about 40 minutes, stirring often. When the rice pudding is almost cooked, remove the lemon zest . Cook to completion and transfer to a baking dish ; when it has cooled slightly, cover with plastic wrap in contact with the surface and let it cool completely .
In the meantime, prepare the accompanying apples: wash and slice the apples into 1/8 - 1/6 inch slices, still unpeeled, then place them in a pan with honey and cinnamon . Cook over low heat for about 15 minutes .
After the cooling time, beat the eggs in a bowl with an electric whisk . When they are fluffy, add one spoonful of rice pudding at a time and continue to mix until you get a smooth batter .
You are ready to fry: drop the batter into hot oil at 340°F using 2 spoons . Fry 4-5 pieces at a time until golden brown, then drain and transfer to paper towels .
When all the fritters are ready roll them in granulated sugar to coat them evenly . Your rice and apple fritters are ready to be served hot alongside the honeyed apples !
It is recommended to consume the rice and apple fritters immediately.
If you prefer, you can serve the rice and apple fritters with some jam instead of the pan-cooked apples!
