instructions:
To make the rice flan in a pan, first cut the fontina into thin slices (remove the rind) . In a large pot with high sides, pour a drizzle of oil , the rice ,
add a pinch of salt, the tomato sauce , the broth , bring to the heat and start cooking . Stir often and cook for about 17 minutes (times may vary depending on the quality of the rice, Carnaroli cooks in 15-18 minutes).
When cooking is finished, the rice should be dry , let it rest for two minutes. After resting, start the creaming: add parmesan, the butter , adjust salt and pepper
and a tablespoon of oil , mix vigorously to incorporate all the ingredients well . Let the rice cool in a bowl for about 5-10 minutes .
Now in a non-stick pan with a base diameter of 8.5 inches and a surface diameter of 11 inches, pour a drizzle of oil and start putting about half of the rice in the pan, spread it with the help of a spatula so that it is well distributed on the bottom of the pan . Now place the fontina in the center of the rice
and the cooked ham . Cover with the remaining rice evenly . At this point, turn on the heat and brown your flan for about 7 minutes. Lightly oil a lid that you will use to flip the flan .
Place the lid and flip the flan to the other side and cook another 7 minutes. When it becomes slightly colored and a little crispy, it will be ready to enjoy .
Immediate consumption is recommended. The rice flan in a pan can be stored in the refrigerator, covered, for one day and reheated in the oven. You can also prepare the rice in advance, store it in the refrigerator, and then make the flan later; however, it is advisable to leave the rice at room temperature so that it is softer and easier to work with.
Towards the end of cooking, stir the rice often because as it dries, it will tend to stick easily. We used Carnaroli, but other risotto rice like Baldo or Arborio will work just fine. You can also get creative with the filling, but one piece of advice: be careful to use ingredients that do not release too much water during cooking, such as mozzarella. If you do not wish to use tomato sauce, it can be omitted, replacing it with the same amount of broth.
