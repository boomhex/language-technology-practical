Golden, crisped skin makes chicken under a brick an absolute favorite for family dinners, bringing together classic comfort and a bit of something special—it just LOOKS and tastes amazing on the dinner table. With that impressive whole-bird presentation, the juicy , flavorful meat always draws a crowd, and those lightly browned edges from the traditional brick chicken recipe can really add to the excitement at any weeknight dinner or weekend get-together. Home cooks love the confidence boost because the chicken comes out crispy every time, never dry, always full of DEEP roasted flavor and enough cozy appeal to make the meal feel like a mini celebration. The simple joy of cutting into that moist spatchcock chicken and seeing the steam rise…well, that’s REAL family meal happiness—such a fun change from regular baked chicken or ordinary skillet recipes. Nothing fussy, just that good , homey taste that works for both the big crowd and the pickiest eaters.
Easy win for busy home cooks—this cast iron skillet chicken fits spontaneous weekday meals or those planned-out afternoons when you want something extra but not complicated. The dish is flexible, so families can swap up the flavors and still keep that awesome fried chicken vibe (go wild with an herb-marinated chicken , or stick to classic pan-seared style—whatever sounds good). Kids usually go for the crispy bits first, adults love the juicy pieces, and everyone comes back for seconds. You’ll find this pressed chicken does great on its own, plus it pairs nicely with everything from simple veggie sides to big bowls of pasta or salads—so versatile, it pretty much guarantees smiles. When you want the flavor of pollo al mattone without all the fuss, this method delivers, with plenty of moist , tender bites and those crowd-pleasing results every home cook hopes for. Honestly, if you’re looking for that DELICIOUS, reliable family meal, this is the one…big flavor, pretty appearance, and tons of ways to serve. Families, regular bakers, and busy parents all agree—can’t go wrong with this one.
In a bowl, mix the lemon juice with the oil the chili flakes and the salt
then add the ground black pepper and mix well. Butterfly the chicken breast to obtain 4 slices, then place it in a bowl where you will also add the chopped onion (6-7)
and the rosemary , then pour about half of the prepared marinade over it .
then turn the chicken slices well in the bowl so they absorb the marinade well and leave them like this for an hour . Then bring the barbecue to temperature , placing a brick, previously covered with a sheet of aluminum foil, to heat on the grill.
Once the necessary time has passed, pat the marinade off the chicken breast and place it on the grill and put the weight on top . Lower the flame under the chicken and cook for about 5 minutes. Remove the brick, rotate the chicken 90°, replace the brick, and cook for another 5 minutes. Remove the brick again, brush with the remaining marinade , flip the chicken, and put the brick back. Cook in the same way as the previous side. Once cooked, plate and decorate the dish with a sprig of rosemary.
