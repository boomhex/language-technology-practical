Excellent seafood combinations include salmon, cod, octopus, and crustaceans. What about vegetables? Absolutely! Try it with carrots, celery, fennel, or combined with delicious recipes based on spinach, zucchini, or eggplant... in short, let your imagination run wild!
Ah, we almost forgot: delicate green olives have always been a perfect match for the Spritz!
