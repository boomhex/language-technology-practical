Deep, rich color makes drunken spaghetti —known as spaghetti all'ubriaco —stand out right away on any family table. The appeal comes from how the red wine pasta transforms both the noodles and the meal itself, filling plates with dramatic, jewel-toned strands that look as unique as they taste. Savory and a little bit sweet , this Italian pasta dish carries subtle aromas instead of any boozy kick, since the alcohol mostly cooks off...meaning even kids might sneak a curious bite (especially if there are some simpler options nearby for picky eaters). With strong yet balanced flavors from the red wine and pasta coming together, it delivers that classic Tuscan recipes vibe, though each region adds small tweaks that keep it fun to explore. Weekend celebrations, holiday meals—even Thursday nights—work well since this dish is as eye-catching as it is visually rich . Families appreciate how a regular pasta dinner suddenly becomes a special experience—wine-infused color, soft creamy texture like risotto, and all those comforting flavors you expect from Italian favorites.
Home cooks like serving drunken spaghetti because it’s a versatile dinner option, easy to pair with other crowd-pleasers. Swapping in Valpolicella wine creates another level of flavor, while playing with herbs , spices , or a touch of garlic helps the dish fit family preferences. Tastes range from mild to a little zippy—ready for adventurous eaters, but also good for kids with gentler palates. Great for using up pantry staples, this style taps into regional variations , with some home cooks adding roasted veggies or cheese (try a shaving of parmesan—always DELICIOUS). Leftovers become tomorrow’s lunch, and everyone gets to have fun figuring out their favorite way to enjoy this pretty plate. Whether it’s an Italian-inspired dinner party or a simple family meal, red wine cooking brings color, taste, and a really nice warmth to the table—everyone gathers round, and somebody always asks for seconds. True la dolce vita ...with just enough twist to keep family meals interesting!
To prepare the drunken spaghetti, start by cleaning the leek: remove the tougher outer leaves , then cut along the leek removing the first layer, to ensure that any impurities and soil residues remain attached and finally slice thinly .
In a pan, melt the butter , then add the chopped leek letting it soften over medium heat and after a few minutes deglaze by pouring in the red wine .
Adjust with sugar , salt, black pepper, and grated nutmeg and let cook for a few more minutes over high heat, this way you will obtain a slightly dry mixture .
When you have achieved the right consistency, not too liquid nor too dry, pour the mixture into a blender and blend until you get a smooth cream that you will then pour back into the pan . In the meantime, cook the spaghetti al dente .
and when they are ready, roughly drain them , in this way you will add a bit of cooking water that will help continue the cooking for a moment in the pan, so the pasta will absorb even more flavor; after a few moments, turn off the heat and add the 1.8 oz of grated pecorino , and after mixing well, serve the drunken spaghetti decorating with the last 0.7 oz of pecorino shavings .
You can store the drunken spaghetti in the refrigerator for up to one day in an airtight container.
If you want, you can replace the Merlot wine with other equally full-bodied wines like Barbera, Barolo, Brunello di Montalcino, Chianti, or Barbaresco. You can also use short pasta shapes. Love decorations? Set aside a few leek rings, blanch them for a few minutes in boiling water, and garnish the dish this way!
