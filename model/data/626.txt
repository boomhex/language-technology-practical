The sweet and sour vegetable toast is, honestly, a delicious twist on the classic toasted sandwich scene in Italy. You know, ditch the usual ham and cheese, and dive into a bright mix of veggies tossed in an agrodolce sauce. This tangy and sweet dressing—made with apple cider vinegar—gives the vegetables a zingy kick, transforming simple ingredients into something special. Really, really good stuff.
What makes this dish stand out is the vegetable and cheese toast with spicy provolone. As it melts in the oven, the cheese becomes gooey and slightly crispy at the edges. So good. The spicy provolone shines against the sweet vegetables, creating a flavor-packed bite that's far from boring. It's a vegetarian delight that's super satisfying and filling.
In cities like Milan or Turin, folks love swapping their usual lunch for a spicy provolone sandwich when they're craving something different. And here's the thing: the combination of toasted bread, moist veggies, and melted provolone offers a rustic, homemade feel. Yet, it’s quick and easy to prepare. People often use whatever veggies they have—like eggplant, peppers, or zucchini—all tossed in that delicious agrodolce mix. The appeal? It lies in the contrast: you bite through the crunchy bread, encounter the melty cheese, and savor those tangy, sweet, and spicy vegetables. Which is great.
This dish is reminiscent of a roasted vegetable bruschetta but with a modern twist. Whether you're preparing a snack or a light meal, this sweet and sour vegetable toast is perfect for those seeking something fresh and satisfying. Plus, it's a fun way to showcase some Italian flavors without too much fuss. Pretty simple. It makes a fantastic option for a quick, tasty lunch or snack. For sure.
First, prepare the sweet and sour sauce. In a small pot, pour the sugar and water. Add the apple cider vinegar and let it reduce over medium heat for about 10 minutes. You should achieve a slightly syrupy consistency . Set aside and let it cool.
Cut the spicy provolone into thin slices , removing the rind and setting it aside . Place the slices of sandwich bread on a baking sheet and toast them in a static oven at 390°F for 6 minutes, then flip them and toast for another 6 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the vegetables. Pour them still frozen into a hot pan with a drizzle of oil and sauté for about 7 minutes. Finally, salt them and transfer them to a bowl .
When the bread is toasted, remove it from the oven and set aside 4 slices. Arrange the provolone on the others and bake again for 5 minutes in grill mode at 390°F. Season the vegetables with the sweet and sour sauce .
As soon as the cheese is completely melted, take the slices of bread out of the oven . Assemble your toast: place the vegetables on a first slice of bread with cheese . Then cover with a second slice of bread, also with cheese .
Add another layer of vegetables and finish with one of the slices of bread set aside . Continue in this way until you prepare your toasts !
We recommend consuming the toasts immediately.
You can replace the provolone with other cheeses like caciocavallo, provola, or scamorza.
If the sweet and sour sauce is too thick and difficult to work with, slightly heat it by adding 1-2 teaspoons of water!
