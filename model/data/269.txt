To prepare the baked anchovies, first focus on the How to Clean Anchovies : remove the head and guts, then open them like a book and remove the spine . Rinse under running water and set aside. Now prepare the breading: finely chop the parsley . In a bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and about three-quarters of the chopped parsley .
Add the cornmeal , season with salt and pepper , then drizzle with a bit of olive oil . Mix to combine all the ingredients.
Spread half of the breading on the bottom of a baking dish and level it out . Neatly arrange the anchovies opened like a book and cover with the remaining breading .
Sprinkle the remaining parsley on the surface and a dusting of Parmesan , then drizzle with more olive oil .
