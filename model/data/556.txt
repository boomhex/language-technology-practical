instructions:
To prepare the pan-made granola, first pour the honey and water into a non-stick pan , turn on the heat, and stir over medium-low flame until it starts to simmer . Meanwhile, coarsely chop the peanuts, almonds, and cashews .
As soon as the syrup starts to bubble, increase the heat and add the nuts , then add the oats and the raisins .
Stir continuously with a wooden spoon . When the ingredients are well combined, lower the heat and continue cooking over medium-low flame for about 20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes . The granola should be golden and slightly toasted .
Transfer the mixture onto an aluminum tray and spread it evenly so it cools quickly . Once cooled, the granola is ready to be used or stored !
The pan-made granola can be stored in an airtight glass jar for a week, in a dry place.
Don't worry if the granola doesn't seem very crunchy at the end of cooking, it will become crunchy once it has completely cooled!
You can replace wildflower honey with another type of honey of your choice.
Customize the granola using your favorite nuts such as pecans, pistachios, or pine nuts! If desired, you can also add some oil seeds.
