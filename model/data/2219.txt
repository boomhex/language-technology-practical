instructions:
To prepare the baked lamb chops, start by trimming the excess fat from the meat , then make cuts between each rib and use your fingers to push the meat down, cleaning the bone as much as possible .
Place the chops in a baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Add 2 sprigs of rosemary, the thyme , and the peppercorns .
Pour about 2 teaspoons of oil , add the freshly grated lemon zest , making sure to sprinkle over all the chops .
Also add a halved clove of garlic , cover with plastic wrap , and let marinate for about 2 hours in the refrigerator. After this time, peel the potatoes and cut them in half .
Further cut the potatoes into wedges . Transfer them to a bowl and season with a clove of garlic cut into 4 and the rosemary needles .
Finally, add salt and about 4 teaspoons of oil . Place the chops in a slightly oiled baking dish (with the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil) and arrange the seasoned potatoes around them .
Wrap the bones with a strip of aluminum foil , fully covering them to prevent burning while cooking. Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 50 minutes (using a fan oven is not recommended as the chops may dry out too much). Once cooked, take out and serve your baked lamb chops immediately !
Baked lamb chops can be stored for a day at most in the refrigerator, closed in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
To make the lamb chops even more flavorful and aromatic, let them marinate overnight!
