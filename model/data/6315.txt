instructions:
To make the chickpea and pumpkin soup , first peel the onion and slice it thinly . Next, take your pumpkin, cut it in half, then remove the seeds from inside , along with the skin ; you’ll need to end up with 1 lb (430 g) of clean pumpkin.
Cut the flesh, first into slices and then into cubes . Wash the chard and cut into thin strips .
Pour the olive oil into a pan, then add the sliced onion and the juniper berries . Allow to brown over low heat until the onion has softened. At this point, add the pumpkin , brown over medium heat, and add with a little of the water .
Add the chickpeas , chard strips , salt, pepper and the rest of the water needed for cooking .
Season with the bay leaves , mix everything together, cover with a lid , and cook on high heat for 15 minutes. Once the 15 minutes are up, remove the lid and continue to cook for a further 15 minutes. Remove the bay leaves
and juniper berries and serve your soup with a drizzle of uncooked oil and a twist of black pepper. Your pumpkin and chickpea soup is ready to serve .
The pumpkin and chickpea soup will keep in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for a couple of days. It can also be frozen.
For a tasty alternative, try baking your soup in the oven, in single-portion bowls, grating a generous amount of Gruyere cheese on top of each one (similar to when you make French onion soup), or simply serve it with tasty homemade bread croutons baked in the oven with rosemary and a very thin slice of lard.
