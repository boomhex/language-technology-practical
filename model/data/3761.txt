To prepare carrot gnocchetti with mixed mushrooms, start with the dough: peel the carrots with a vegetable peeler and cut the carrots into fairly thick slices , then boil them in a pot with slightly salted water . When the carrots are soft (it will take about 15 minutes), drain and let them cool. Then blend the carrots with an immersion blender ,
then crack the eggs, beat them with a fork , and add them to the carrots ; mix, then add the grated pecorino cheese ,
the nutmeg, and the sifted flour . Mix the mixture with a spatula and cover it with plastic wrap to let it rest in the refrigerator for at least half an hour. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce by cleaning the mushrooms: with a kitchen cloth, clean the surface of the pleurotus mushroom caps and the stem to remove soil, then with a small knife separate the stems from the cluster , and if necessary, go over the caps and the internal gills with the cloth to remove any remaining soil.
How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms by gently scraping the stem with a small knife to remove any soil, then with a cotton cloth ; separate the mushroom caps from the stems and if they are still very dirty, quickly rinse them under a stream of cold running water. Clean the champignon mushrooms with a cotton cloth , rinse them briefly under running water, then cut the cleaned mushroom heads and stems into thin slices .
For honey mushrooms, cut off the stem end , rinse under running water, and boil for at least 15-20 minutes in plenty of boiling water, occasionally skimming off the surface residues with a skimmer. Once the mushroom cleaning is complete, peel and chop a shallot , then pour oil and a whole garlic clove (which you can remove afterward) into a large pan .
Let the shallot soften and the garlic clove brown over low heat, then add the chopped parsley and mushrooms ; sauté them for a few minutes then deglaze with white wine , let it evaporate, and turn off the heat.
Retrieve the gnocchi dough from the fridge, divide it into pieces, and handle them to create small logs ; with a dough scraper or the slightly floured blade of a knife, make the gnocchetti , to which you can give the typical grooves using a gnocchi board or by passing the gnocchetti over the tines of a fork. As you make them, place the gnocchetti on a slightly floured tray.
Once ready, cook the gnocchi in a large pot with plenty of salted water to taste : it will take just a few moments, when the gnocchi rise to the surface, drain them with a skimmer and transfer them directly into the pan with the sauce . Sauté them for a few seconds over low heat, season with pepper, and mix to enhance the flavor, and your carrot gnocchetti with mixed mushrooms will be ready to enjoy!
You can store carrot gnocchetti with mixed mushrooms in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 1 day.
Cooked mushrooms can be stored in the refrigerator for 1 day, in an airtight container.
Uncooked gnocchi can be frozen arranged on a slightly floured tray and covered with plastic wrap. It will not be necessary to thaw them before cooking.

If the dough is too soft, you can add a little flour, but be careful not to overdo it to avoid the opposite effect. For a bolder taste, you can add some sliced speck to the sauce!
