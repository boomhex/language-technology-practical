To prepare cucunciata pasta, start with the bell pepper: grill it on a grill plate or in the oven at 450°F for about 20 minutes . Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them in half , wash and cut the eggplant into 1/2-inch cubes .

Pour a drizzle of oil into a non-stick pan and brown a clove of garlic over low heat . Sauté the eggplant in the pan with the garlic . When the eggplant is well browned, add the cherry tomatoes .

Cook over medium heat until they are well cooked . Meanwhile, in a tall, narrow glass, pour the desalted cucunci and anchovies .
Also add 1.4 oz of oil , a pinch of salt and pepper , and blend with an immersion mixer .
You should obtain a creamy consistency . Meanwhile, the bell pepper will be ready , let it cool for a few minutes and peel it, then cut it into 1- to 1.5-inch pieces, removing the seeds .
