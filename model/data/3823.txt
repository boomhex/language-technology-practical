instructions:
To prepare oysters with lemon and pepper, ensure the oyster shells are closed , then open the oysters. This is a delicate operation, so equip yourself with a special knife with a thin blade, handle protection to protect your fingers, and a firm grip. Hold the oyster firmly with one hand and, with the other, take the knife and find the opening (you may request pre-pierced oysters from the fishmonger for easier opening), insert the blade, and cut the muscle located in the center . After cutting it, it will be easier to follow the circumference, opening the oyster entirely .
Open the shell halfway, being careful not to spill the oyster water . The fresher and more alive an oyster is, the more difficult it is to open. If you are not experienced, protect the hand holding the oyster with a cloth to avoid accidental injuries. Crush the ice in the ice crusher and distribute it on a serving platter .
Place the oysters on top with lemon wedges and serve them; each guest will season with lemon juice and pepper to taste (8-9).
Once opened, oysters should be consumed immediately. Fresh, closed oysters can be stored in the refrigerator, wrapped in a damp cloth.
An oyster must be alive to be edible. To verify this, once opened, check that it has a compact appearance and contracts if touched. To distinguish live oysters, ensure the shells are closed and have no holes or openings. This way, the seawater inside will preserve freshness and flavor.
The most prized (and expensive) oyster is the one with a round and flat shell and flesh with a more delicate flavor. The market also offers more affordable oysters with oval and concave shells, less prized and with stronger tasting flesh: generally, they are Japanese and Portuguese.
