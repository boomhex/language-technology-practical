To prepare the rainbow whoopie, start by making the dough: mix the cream and the vanilla extract . In the bowl of a stand mixer, or with the beaters of a hand mixer, whip the butter with the sugar until you get a smooth mixture . Add the egg, the salt , and
the cream mixed with vanilla , then mix again to combine the ingredients . At this stage, it's important that all ingredients are at the same temperature; otherwise, the butter will immediately become lumpy. If this happens, don't worry: adding flour, which is a stabilizer, will make everything homogeneous. Sift together, in a bowl, the flour, cornstarch, and baking powder .
Add the dry ingredients to the mixture, alternating them with the milk , and keep mixing: you will get a very thick, soft, and compact mixture . Divide the dough into 4 equal parts : one part will remain white, while the other three will be colored.
Add a few drops of food coloring to the three parts of dough to be colored : you can choose your preferred color; we used yellow, red, and blue. Start by adding a little coloring, then mix vigorously , and if the color doesn't satisfy you, add more coloring until you get the desired shade. Transfer the mixture to a piping bag with a plain tip, and on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, squeeze the dough to form rather tall disks, 1 inch in diameter .
Bake the whoopie in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 13-14 minutes (if fan-assisted, 320°F for 10-12 minutes) . Meanwhile, prepare the pastry cream according to the instructions Pastry cream : heat the milk in a saucepan with half of a vanilla bean and its seeds; whisk the yolk and sugar in a bowl, then add the flour. With tongs, remove the bean and pour the heated milk over the mixture in a thin stream , blending with the whisk. Return the mixture to the heat and stir continuously until the cream thickens . Transfer the pastry cream to a bowl and let it cool, storing it with a sheet of cling film in contact. Remove the whoopie from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack.
When they are cool, transfer the cream into a piping bag, saving a couple of tablespoons. Assemble the rainbow whoopie: take a colored disk and fill it with a dollop of cream; take another disk of the same or a different color, brush the surface with the reserved cream , and place it on the filled disk, pressing lightly. Sprinkle the brushed surface with sprinkles, which will adhere well . Fill all the other whoopie in this way until they are finished: your rainbow whoopie are ready! You can fill the rainbow whoopie with your preferred cream: White chocolate pastry cream ; Buttercream ; Chantilly cream ; Chocolate custard cream .
Store the filled rainbow whoopie in the refrigerator for 4-5 days. Before serving, let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. You can also prepare the whoopie and store them at room temperature for up to a week and fill them as needed. Freezing is not recommended.
If you want to make your whoopie even more rainbow-like, you can also color the filling. Just mix in a few drops of coloring to get soft, spreadable, inviting, and naturally carnival-like pastry creams of all hues!
