To prepare the gnocchi with scorpionfish ragù and bottarga, first prepare the fish: remove the scales under cold running water using the appropriate tool or a knife , then pat it dry and gut it.

Salt and pepper, then add the rosemary sprigs and the unpeeled garlic cloves .
Fragrance with grated lemon zest and massage well with your hands to absorb the aromas . Finally, distribute the cherry tomatoes in the tray and bake at 329°F (165°C) for 25 minutes in the oven with 50% steam function.

After the cooking time of the scorpionfish , remove from the oven and clean the fish, extracting only the flesh . Transfer it to a bowl and break it up with your hands, checking that there are no bones .
Pour the cherry tomatoes along with the scorpionfish cooking water into a large pan . Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the gnocchi for a few minutes . When they float to the surface, drain them directly into the pan .
Add an abundant grating of bottarga and sauté everything over high heat to thicken the sauce. Pepper and add the scorpionfish flesh, with the heat off .
