instructions:
To prepare the baking dish of roasted potatoes, start by peeling the potatoes , then rinse them under running water and dry them thoroughly. Mix the oil with the melted butter in a small bowl and use this mixture to grease an ovenproof dish (we used a rectangular one measuring 8x10 inches). At this point, use a sharp knife or a mandoline to cut the potatoes into slices about 1/16 inch thick .
Place the slices vertically in a row in the baking dish (take ten at a time so that they will stand upright), forming 3 rows of potatoes inside it . Cut the shallots into slices and place them in the empty spaces between the potatoes ,
chop a red chili pepper without seeds and sprinkle it over the baking dish . Finally, brush the potatoes with the previously prepared butter and oil mixture . Bake at 392°F for about 60 minutes, then remove the dish from the oven, sprinkle thyme leaves over the potatoes and salt them. Put the dish back in the oven for another 15/20 minutes until the potatoes are cooked and quite crispy on the surface!
We recommend eating the roasted potatoes as soon as they are ready, but if you prefer, you can store them for a couple of days at most in the fridge, sealed airtight.
This dish, believe me, is a royal side! It is suitable for accompanying meat and fish dishes during winter or for being served during an outdoor summer lunch: guess what will be the main attraction...
