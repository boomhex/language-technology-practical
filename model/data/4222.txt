Mint pesto is a fresh sauce with a distinctly balsamic flavor that characterizes this aromatic plant, often used in dessert preparation. In this recipe, we use it to prepare a delicious and fragrant savory sauce, perfect for accompanying grilled fish or carpaccio but also roasted meat; simple and quick to prepare, it can be a pleasant alternative to season and flavor various main dishes. To make mint pesto, simply blend (or crush in a mortar) mint leaves along with pine nuts, extra virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper until a creamy and spreadable consistency is achieved.
Also try the purslane pesto , a tasty variant with tangy notes!
To make mint pesto, start by detaching the mint leaves from the stems , then wash them under running water and let them drain in a colander .
Finally, dry them well with an absorbent paper towel . Take a food processor and place the mint leaves , the pine nuts ,
the salt , the pepper , and a little bit of oil . Turn on the food processor
for a couple of minutes until the ingredients are chopped , then gradually add the rest of the oil until a creamy consistency is achieved . If you have a mortar, you can proceed by crushing the mint with the pine nuts and gradually adding the oil. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary, and store the mint pesto sauce in the refrigerator until use.
It is possible to freeze the pesto in small jars and then defrost it in the refrigerator or at room temperature. Store the freshly made mint pesto in the refrigerator for 2-3 days in an airtight container, making sure to cover the sauce with a layer of oil.
For optimal results, we recommend choosing mint with tender and very fragrant leaves.
