Ragusani Easter pies, or pastieri ragusani , are such a beloved part of Sicilian Easter celebrations, especially in the beautiful province of Ragusa. I mean, this traditional dish has these humble roots—originally made by families who used offal instead of the pricier lamb cuts. Over time, though, the recipe evolved. And now? It's a moist mix of ground meat and caciocavallo cheese that really, really enhances the flavor. Seriously good. These pies are a staple during Easter, lovingly prepared on Holy Saturday to ensure there's enough for Easter Sunday lunch—and you know—those relaxed gatherings throughout the week. And the feeling of pulling a golden, homemade pie from a picnic basket on Easter Monday, known locally as 'Pasquetta'? Pretty much unbeatable.
Think of this dish as a wonderful blend between a Sicilian lamb pie and a savory pastry. It pairs perfectly with other festive foods, like colomba salata or pastiera salata. The combo of ground meat and cheese gives each bite a tender, savory punch, while the crust stays perfectly crispy—even after a few days. And look, people love how these traditional Sicilian Easter recipes can be made in big batches—which is great for sharing with family and friends. Plus, they store beautifully, so you can just grab a slice whenever. And the flavor? It only gets better with time. Every time these pies grace the table, they bring a strong sense of tradition, connecting everyone to Sicilian Easter celebrations that have been cherished for generations. With simple roots and a rich taste, this dish isn't just food—it's a piece of history from Ragusa, keeping the best of Sicilian Easter cuisine alive and delicious for all to enjoy. Whether you're savoring them at a family gathering or a casual picnic, these pies capture the heart and soul of Sicily's Easter traditions. And cannot go wrong with that.
To make the Ragusan pastieri, start by preparing the dough: first dissolve the yeast in water , then pour the flour into a large bowl and gradually add the water and oil while you start kneading with your hands .
Also add the lard and salt and knead to combine all the ingredients, then transfer to the work surface and continue kneading until you get a smooth and elastic dough . Shape the dough into a ball and place it in the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise at room temperature for at least an hour.
In the meantime, you can start on the filling: combine the two types of ground meat in a bowl and mix with your hands to combine them. Pour the meat into a pan , add salt, pepper and sauté for a couple of minutes over medium heat, being careful not to overcook or completely crumble it .
Transfer the browned meat to a bowl and let it cool . In the meantime, grate the caciocavallo with a coarse grater . Once cooled, add a grated clove of garlic to the meat ,
chopped parsley and caciocavallo , and mix well to combine .
After the rising time, take the dough and roll it out on a lightly floured surface until you get a rectangle of 18.5x15.75 inches with a thickness of about 1/12 inch . Cut out discs using a 4.75-inch diameter cutter , then re-knead the scraps and roll out the dough again to cut out more discs until you have a total of 18 pieces.
Stuff each disc by placing a tablespoon of filling in the center and close it by lifting the edges and pinching them with your fingers to create a scalloped edge . As they are ready, place the pies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper .
At this point, crack the eggs into a bowl, season with salt and pepper, and beat with a fork . Pour some of the eggs over each pie, making sure the liquid does not spill out: you can use your hands to help it penetrate into the meat, at least partially .
Use the leftover eggs to brush the dough . Bake the pies in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 35 minutes . Your Ragusan pastieri are ready to be enjoyed !
The Ragusan pastieri can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. You can freeze them already filled: when it's time to bake them, let them thaw briefly before placing them in the oven.
The meat filling can also be added raw inside the pies, so if you prefer, you can skip the pan step and proceed with baking only. If you're intrigued by the idea of trying a version similar to the original, you can replace the ground meat with finely chopped lamb and follow the same recipe!
