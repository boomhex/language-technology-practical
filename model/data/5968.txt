instructions:

To make the mascarpone cream , pour the water into a saucepan and add the white sugar . Stir gently and bring the mixture to 250°F (121°C), measuring the temperature with a food thermometer ; if you don’t have a thermometer, the syrup will be ready when small white bubbles form on the surface.

Just before the syrup reaches 250°F (so, around 240°F (115°C)), start to beat the eggs using a hand mixer or stand mixer . Once the syrup has reached 250°F, pour the egg yolks in slowly, lowering the mixer speed while continuing to mix . Continue to beat the mixture until it has cooled completely . This is how you make pâte à bombe, the base for lots of confectionery creations.
In a bowl, soften the mascarpone using a spatula, then add the now-cooled egg yolk mixture a little at a time . Slowly stir the mascarpone into the mixture using the whisks on the mixer or a spatula so you get an even cream .

Your mascarpone cream is ready ! You can try it spread on a slice of panettone or pandoro or on its own in a glass , garnishing with sifted unsweetened cocoa powder if you like .
Store for up to 3-4 days in the fridge covered with plastic wrap.

Freezing is not recommended because this could spoil the cream’s velvety consistency.

If you prefer a cream with a denser consistency, let it set in the fridge for around one hour before serving.
