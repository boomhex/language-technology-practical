instructions:
Lasagna with rabbit ragu is one of those classic Ligurian dishes that feels like it could only come from a home kitchen somewhere on the coast of Italy. Really, it's all about layers—literally—with tender wild rabbit slow-cooked until it just falls apart, mixed with chiodini mushrooms that give a woodsy bite. And the salty kick from those little Taggiasca olives ? People love that in Liguria. Add in cherry tomatoes for a pop of sweet flavor and that silky béchamel sauce that soaks right into the egg pasta sheets, and you get a rabbit ragu lasagna that’s hearty and full of personality.
Each bite is moist from the ragù and béchamel. You get that comforting, old-school taste that feels like someone’s nonna spent all day in the kitchen just for you. Seriously good.
In Liguria, this kind of mushroom lasagna is a real treat because rabbit isn't something you see every day, especially cooked this slowly. It’s how they feed a crowd or celebrate something special with the whole family. Folks take pride in using local ingredients, so when you get a lasagna with rabbit and mushrooms here, it’s going to taste like the woods and the coast at the same time. The earthy flavor of the rabbit and mushrooms mixes with the creamy béchamel and the golden, slightly chewy pasta layers for a dish that’s both fancy and totally homey.
People in Liguria might call this the best kind of homemade lasagna recipe —a dish that comes out of the oven crispy on top, tender in the middle, and smelling like something you just want to dive into. And look, it’s the kind of food that brings everyone to the table and keeps them there, telling stories and sneaking seconds. If you’re after a taste of real, traditional Italian lasagna, this rabbit and mushroom lasagna from Liguria checks all the boxes. So, next time you’re looking to impress with something unique and really really good, this dish will definitely do the trick.
Enjoy a meal that’s as much about the flavors as it is about the memories it creates. For real.
To prepare the lasagna with rabbit ragù and mushrooms, it is necessary to marinate the deboned rabbit for at least 2 hours or better yet overnight; keep the rabbit bones aside because you will need them for preparing the broth. For the marinade, clean and roughly chop half an onion, the celery, then take the sprigs of rosemary, thyme, 1 clove of garlic, a few black peppercorns, and the crushed juniper berries. Also cut the rabbit meat into strips , then into cubes and place it in a bowl, then add the aromatics you have prepared: the onion, celery , garlic,
the sage leaves, rosemary sprigs, thyme leaves, and juniper berries ; then cover everything with white wine and let it marinate for at least two hours or overnight , covered with plastic wrap and in the refrigerator.
To prepare the broth, pour the water into a pot, then add the rabbit bones, onion, celery, carrot, and a pinch of salt: simmer over very low heat for at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, dedicate yourself to the mushrooms: clean the mushrooms by cutting off the end part , wash them; then blanch them for 15-20 minutes before pouring them into a large pan where you have lightly sautéed the chopped garlic with a drizzle of oil .
You can extend them with a little meat broth to facilitate cooking, but they should cook for only a few minutes while remaining crunchy; adjust with salt and pepper, add the chopped parsley , mix, and turn off the heat. Now prepare the rabbit ragù: take the onion, half a stalk of celery, and a carrot and finely chop them.
Do the same with garlic, sage, thyme, bay leaf, and rosemary . Drizzle a wide pan with a little oil, then add the chopped onion, celery, carrot, and the clove of garlic and let the sauté simmer over low heat. Carefully drain the rabbit from the marinade, removing the aromatics .
When the sauté is wilted, add the rabbit and the chopped aromatic herbs , then let it brown for 10-15 minutes .
Deglaze the meat with white wine , let it evaporate, then add the rabbit broth from time to time, cooking with the lid on , until the meat is very tender: it will take about 1 hour. Towards the end of cooking, wash and cut the cherry tomatoes into wedges ,
add them to the rabbit ragù , then also add the pitted Taggiasca olives . Adjust with salt and pepper, then turn off the heat. Then focus on the Béchamel sauce : in a saucepan, heat the milk, flavor it with grated nutmeg , and salt and pepper to taste.
In another large saucepan, pour the butter and let it melt over low heat ; once melted, sprinkle in the flour and mix with a whisk to create the roux. When the mixture has slightly darkened and become more dense, pour in the hot milk .
Then continue mixing with the whisk to thicken the béchamel over low heat . Take a 12x8 inch baking dish and drizzle it with a little oil; distribute a layer of béchamel and place a layer of lasagna .
Layer with a layer of rabbit ragù , one of mushrooms , then proceed by sprinkling with grated Parmesan and a few tablespoons of béchamel .
Start again with another layer of lasagna and continue in the same order until you finish the ingredients, sprinkling with Parmesan and a few tablespoons of béchamel . Then bake the lasagna in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 30 minutes (if using a fan oven, at 356°F for about 20 minutes). Once cooked, take them out of the oven and serve them hot!
You can store the lasagna with rabbit ragù and mushrooms, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container, for 1-2 days. They can be prepared the day before, kept in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap, and cooked the next day. They can be frozen, only if all fresh ingredients were used, preferably uncooked: to cook them, simply thaw them in the refrigerator about 24 hours beforehand and then bake them in the oven.
If you prefer, you can also use other varieties of mushrooms such as porcini or champignons.
