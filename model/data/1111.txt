instructions:
To make sfouf, pour the flour, semolina , sugar , and baking powder into a large bowl.
Add the turmeric and mix the dry ingredients with a hand whisk. While continuing to stir, also add the milk and vegetable oil .
You should obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture . Now take a high-sided rectangular pan measuring approximately 15x10 inches and brush the bottom and sides with tahini . Pour the mixture inside and sprinkle the surface with pine nuts .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 35 minutes . Once cooked, take the cake out of the oven and let it cool slightly . Serve the sfouf cut into squares or diamonds about 1.5 inches in size !
Sfouf can be stored at room temperature, covered with plastic wrap or under a glass dome, for up to 5-6 days. You can freeze it after cooking and cooling it completely.
Sfouf is often also flavored with ground anise seeds or orange blossom water; pine nuts can be replaced with almonds or sesame seeds. Try these alternatives and choose your favorite! As an alternative to tahini, you can use butter.
