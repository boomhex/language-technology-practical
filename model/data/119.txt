instructions:
To prepare the vegan panna cotta, first pour the agar agar into a saucepan , add a couple of tablespoons of soy milk and mix with a whisk to blend it. At this point, add the remaining soy milk .
Also pour in the vegetable cream and sifted powdered sugar . Mix well with the whisk .
Place the saucepan on the stove and cook over medium-low heat until it reaches a slight boil, stirring continuously to prevent sticking . Let it simmer for about 3 minutes, then turn off the heat and pour the still warm mixture into 4 small glasses; each glass should contain about 1 cup of panna cotta . Allow to cool at room temperature , then place in the refrigerator for at least 5 hours.
After the setting time, focus on the coulis: in a saucepan, combine the raspberries with the lemon juice and powdered sugar . Cook over low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring with a spatula .
Turn off the heat and blend with an immersion blender to obtain a smooth consistency . Take the glasses from the refrigerator and distribute the raspberry coulis on the surface .
Garnish with fresh raspberries and blueberries , then finish with some chopped almonds . Your vegan panna cotta is ready to be enjoyed !
Vegan panna cotta can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, with or without coulis.
Instead of soy milk, you can use another type of unsweetened plant-based beverage.
