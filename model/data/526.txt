instructions:
To prepare the mirror glaze, first finely chop the dark chocolate and transfer it into a bowl . Now prepare the syrup: pour the sugar into a saucepan .
Add the water as well and as soon as it starts to boil cook for 3 minutes. Pour the hot syrup directly over the chocolate .
Stir vigorously with a spatula, being careful not to incorporate air, until the chocolate is completely melted . Add the honey and stir again to obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture .
Transfer the glaze into a tall glass and emulsify with an immersion blender , without incorporating air, until you get a smooth glaze . Use the glaze as soon as possible to prevent it from setting too much. If it becomes too hard, you can heat it for 20/30 seconds in the microwave. The correct usage temperature is 95°F. At this temperature, the glaze will be fluid enough, not too liquid, but not too solid either.
The glaze can be stored in the refrigerator for a week. Just heat it in the microwave when you want to use it.
For a perfect result, the dessert to be glazed should be frozen first at 0°F, eliminating the risk of the dessert melting when in contact with the glaze or, if excessively cold, creating an unfavorable thermal shock for the good spreading of the glaze.
