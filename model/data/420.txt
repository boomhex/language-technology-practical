To prepare the winter rice salad with turnip greens and Ragusano, start by cooking the basmati rice in salted boiling water, for the time indicated on the package . Meanwhile, in a large non-stick pan, toast the pine nuts , frequently turning the pan for even browning: it will only take a few minutes.
Soak the raisins for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, shave the Ragusano cheese and clean the turnip greens , wash them, pat them dry, and place them in a pan with 2 cloves of garlic in their skins and a drizzle of oil .
To help them wilt better, you can moisten with a couple of ladles of the rice cooking water , then cover with the lid and cook for about 10 minutes over medium heat, remembering to stir and check occasionally. Once ready, add the drained raisins to the pan with the greens .
Also add the dried chili . Drain the rice and transfer it to a large bowl, then season with a drizzle of oil .
Mix , add the seasoned greens and let it cool slightly. At this point, also add the Ragusano cheese .
Shortly before serving, complete with the toasted pine nuts and mix . Here is your winter rice salad with turnip greens and Ragusano ready !
The winter rice salad with turnip greens and Ragusano can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
It is recommended to add the pine nuts at the last moment, before serving the salad, so they remain crunchy.
