To prepare the Tuscan fritters, start by heating the water in a saucepan. In a large bowl, pour the chestnut flour and a pinch of salt . The water should be hot but not boiling, pour it into the bowl slowly and stir simultaneously.
You need to keep stirring while you pour the water to prevent lumps . Now heat the seed oil in a pan and, when it reaches about 340°F, immerse a spoonful of batter at a time, being very careful not to burn yourself with the hot oil .
Fry for 2-3 minutes, then flip the fritters to the other side and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Drain on a plate with some paper towels . Once all the batter is finished, sprinkle the Tuscan chestnut fritters with sugar to taste.
It's best to enjoy the Tuscan chestnut fritters freshly fried. They can be stored without sugar and reheated before serving.
You can flavor the batter with lemon zest or the seeds of a vanilla pod.
