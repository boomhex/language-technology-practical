To prepare the coconut pancakes, first, pour the eggs into a bowl along with the brown sugar and whisk together. Add the coconut milk and mix again. In another bowl, combine the flour and baking powder .
Add the dry ingredients and mix to incorporate them, then add the shredded coconut . Stir to obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture .
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat (preferably with a thick bottom), and if necessary, grease it with a little butter. Pour a ladle of batter into the center of the pan; there is no need to spread it out . When bubbles start to appear on the surface and the base is golden, flip it to the other side using a spatula . Let it brown on the other side as well .
Transfer the pancake to a tray and continue in this way until the batter is used up, stacking them on top of each other; with these quantities, you should get about 12 pancakes. Once ready, cut the coconut into pieces and the pineapple into cubes .
Drizzle the pancakes with acacia honey and garnish with the fruit pieces . Your coconut pancakes are ready to enjoy !
Ungarnished coconut pancakes can be stored at room temperature for one day.
