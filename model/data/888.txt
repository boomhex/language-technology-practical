instructions:
To prepare the meat and bacon rolls, start by preparing the bell peppers: wash the peppers, cut them in half, and remove the stem and seeds . Divide the pepper into 8 slices about 1 inch . Heat a grill on the stove, and when it's hot, place the peppers to roast .
Let them cook for about 10 minutes, until they're nicely charred but still soft . Transfer the peppers to a baking dish , cover with plastic wrap , and let them cool at room temperature.
Take a slice of scottona and lay it on the cutting board. Stuff by placing a slice of edamer, cut in half, in the center of the meat slice . Place a slice of cooked pepper on the cheese , add a few fresh thyme leaves, and season with salt and pepper.
With light pressure from your fingers, roll the meat slice over itself to form a roll . Wrap a slice of bacon around the roll and secure it with one or two toothpicks .
Continue this way until all the rolls are done . Pour a drizzle of oil into a pan and add two sprigs of thyme . Transfer the rolls to the pan .
Brown the rolls over medium heat for about 5 minutes, turning them to brown well . Deglaze with white wine and let the alcohol evaporate. Once the alcohol has evaporated, add water .
Cover with a lid and continue cooking for about 5 minutes, then uncover, raise the heat, and let the excess liquids reduce . The rolls should be soft and golden brown. Turn off the heat and serve your meat and bacon rolls hot !
The meat and bacon rolls can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days.
You can use smoked or spicy cheese for a more intense flavor.
In every region, you can find a typical version of meat rolls... try the Apulian Bombette or the Sicilian-style Rolls , for example!
