Fried doughnuts, you know, always bring a sweet kind of joy, especially when you try them the Southern Italian way. Down in Naples and the surrounding region, people get really, really excited about making homemade doughnuts from scratch. The dough? Worked by hand the old-fashioned way. And no fancy equipment needed—just a little time and some good energy. Seriously good. The real secret is in the dough: it has to rise until it’s super tender and fluffy, giving you that perfect bite. In Italy, this doughnut is pretty close to what they call graffe, a favorite for Carnevale. Folks love them either plain or rolled in sugar, so you end up with these golden circles that are soft in the middle and just the right amount of crispy on the outside. Sometimes, they go wild with toppings like coffee glaze or hazelnut sprinkles, which add a real Italian twist to the fried doughnuts everyone knows.
But it's not just about the taste—making a batch of these easy doughnut recipe favorites feels like a celebration. Italian families often let the dough rise for a couple of hours while chatting or listening to music. And then, they watch as each ring puffs up in the hot oil, turning golden and moist in no time. The smell? Fills the kitchen and gets everyone grabbing for a warm doughnut, especially right after they get tossed in sugar. Some folks in Southern Italy say the trick is all about keeping the oil at the right temp so the doughnuts cook evenly and don’t get greasy. For sure. Whether you keep it simple with just sugar or go for something fancier, the best homemade doughnuts are all about playing with flavors. A little cinnamon sugar, a drizzle of coffee glaze, maybe some chopped nuts—there are so many ways to make them your own. This isn’t just a classic doughnut recipe ; it’s a fun way to make memories, experiment with tasty toppings, and bring a bit of Italian happiness into your kitchen. Imagine sharing these with friends while enjoying a warm cup of espresso—it's the kind of treat that makes everyday moments feel special. Pretty simple, right?

To prepare the fried doughnuts, start with the dough. Pour the room temperature milk into a small bowl, add the yeast and the sugar . Stir until they are well dissolved .
In a large bowl, pour the flour and butter , add the egg and start kneading with your hands. While kneading, gradually pour in the milk in which you dissolved the yeast .
Continue working until you get a homogeneous mixture , then move to a floured work surface, add a pinch of salt and knead the dough for about 10 minutes .
You will need to get a smooth and elastic dough . Grease a bowl with a little oil and place your dough inside, then cover with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature until doubled . This will take about 4-5 hours.
After this time, place the dough back on a work surface and cut it into two logs . From each log, cut 5 equal pieces , making 10 in total. Take each portion and shape it into a ball between your hands .
Cut 10 squares of parchment paper. Grease your hands with a little oil and press each ball on one of the parchment squares , aiming for a disk about 3-4 inches in diameter. Using the base of a wooden spoon, create a hole in the center and gently enlarge it with your hands .
Proceed like this with all the dough. Let the doughnuts rise for another hour without covering them . Pour 3 fingers of oil into a high-sided pan and bring it to a temperature of 338°F. At this point, place the doughnuts in the oil (a few at a time so as not to lower the temperature) along with the parchment paper , which will detach after less than a minute. Gradually remove the parchment sheets using tongs .
Brown the doughnuts on both sides . It will take 5-6 minutes in total. If they brown too quickly, lower the heat. Transfer the doughnuts to paper towels . Prepare the glaze by placing the powdered sugar in a bowl and gradually adding the coffee (not all at once as it may not all be needed), stirring with a fork .
You should obtain a dense and lump-free glaze . Dip the top of the doughnuts into the glaze , then turn them over on a cutting board and immediately sprinkle with hazelnut crumbs . In just a few minutes, the glaze will dry, and you'll be ready to enjoy your doughnuts!
To enjoy them at their best, we recommend consuming the fried doughnuts within a few hours of preparation. You can freeze the raw doughnuts and fry them after thawing.
You can also enrich the surface of your glaze with other nuts, sugar crumbs, or chocolate flakes.
