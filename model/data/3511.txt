instructions:
To prepare the basic batter for buckwheat crepes, start by placing the buckwheat flour in a bowl, then add the sifted all-purpose flour and half a teaspoon of salt. Stir with a wooden spoon and then incorporate the milk and water gradually . Mix the ingredients well, making sure not to form lumps, and finally add the oil
and the two previously beaten eggs . Let the batter rest for 2 hours covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator. Heat a non-stick crepe pan on the stove, melt some butter to grease it, and when it's hot, pour a ladleful of batter into the center (which you will have stirred again after the resting time in the refrigerator). Tilt and rotate the pan immediately to distribute the batter over the entire surface. Let it cook for about a minute, and as soon as it turns golden, flip it to the other side with a spatula, being careful not to break it . When the crepe is golden on both sides, slide it onto a serving plate, ready to be garnished with your preferred ingredients.
