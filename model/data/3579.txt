To prepare the tricolor savory pie, start by making the Easy Shortcrust Pastry by cleaning the spinach and transferring it to a non-stick pan with a drizzle of oil . Let them wilt for a few minutes and let them cool (2-3).
Once cold, transfer them to a bowl and lightly mash them with a fork, then add the egg . Blend everything with an immersion blender until you obtain a puree, which you will use to flavor the shortcrust pastry .
Then combine the flour, cold cubed butter, and salt in a mixer (7-8). Blend for a few moments to obtain a crumbly mixture .
Transfer the butter and flour mixture to a work surface and add the spinach puree . Work quickly with your hands, so as not to warm the ingredients, until you have a homogeneous mixture . Form a dough ball, wrap it in cling film, and place it in the fridge for at least two hours until it is firm .
In the meantime, start preparing the filling for the tricolor savory pie. Thinly slice the spring onion, fry it in a pan with two tablespoons of oil and let it brown over moderate heat . Add the peas, salt, pepper, and cook over low heat until tender .
Separately, in a pot, place the cleaned potatoes with their skins and boil for about 30 minutes . To speed up the process, you can use a pressure cooker and cook them for 15 minutes. The important thing is that the potatoes do not fall apart during cooking but remain compact. Once cooked, let them cool and then peel them , then cut them into slices half an inch thick .
Meanwhile, trim the zucchini and slice them with a mandoline . In another pan, heat the remaining oil with the garlic cloves. Once browned, remove them and add the freshly sliced zucchini . Cook them over high heat, keeping them crunchy, stirring occasionally, then adjust with salt and pepper .
After two hours, take the shortcrust pastry dough and roll it out on the work surface to a thickness of half an inch . Butter a 10-inch diameter mold and line it with the rolled-out pastry . Prick the bottom with a fork .
Proceed with the first layer by arranging the zucchini to cover the base , then proceed with a layer of peas , and finally finish the tricolor savory pie by laying the potatoes .
Now prepare a sauce to cover the tricolor savory pie: beat the cream together with the eggs in a bowl , then salt, pepper, add the finely chopped chives and grated nutmeg .
Pour the mixture over the pie to spread it all over the surface, sprinkle with dried oregano, then complete with the tomatoes cut in half . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F (for a fan oven at 320°F) for 45-50 minutes . Remove the tricolor savory pie from the oven, let it cool slightly, then serve by cutting it into slices.
It is advisable to consume the tricolor savory pie the same day. Alternatively, it can be stored for a day in the refrigerator wrapped in cling film and reheated in the oven before serving.
You can store the shortcrust pastry in the refrigerator for a maximum of a couple of days wrapped in cling film.
Try replacing the cream with milk, perhaps adding some ricotta or goat cheese to make it creamier.
