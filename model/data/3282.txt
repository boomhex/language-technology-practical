To prepare the croque monsieur finger food with classic puff pastry, first make the béchamel sauce ( Béchamel sauce for more guidance): put the butter in a saucepan and let it melt, add the sifted flour , and stir constantly to obtain the roux.

Cover the saucepan with a lid and cook the béchamel sauce, still on low heat, for 15 minutes, the time it takes to thicken the sauce, stirring occasionally .
Meanwhile, finely grate the Gruyère cheese and cut the cooked ham into small squares. Prepare the top part of the croque monsieur by topping 12 puff pastries with a teaspoon of béchamel sauce and a handful of grated Gruyère (5-6).
Fill the other 12 puff pastries with another teaspoon of béchamel sauce , a small square of cooked ham , and a handful of Gruyère .
Now assemble the croque monsieur finger food by placing the puff pastry with béchamel and Gruyère on top of the one filled with béchamel, ham, and Gruyère , like a sandwich .
