instructions:
Lovers of crispy lasagna edges, this one's for you! This spin on the classic dish isn't only easier (no tedious layering required) but it ensures more perfectly crisp bites all throughout. Broken up lasagna pieces, or taccole pasta, make it feel more layered than your average baked pasta.
Feel free to assemble this ahead of time and refrigerate until it's time to serve - then pop it in the oven when it's time to eat!
