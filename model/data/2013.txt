Susumelle cookies are, I gotta say, a beloved part of Christmas traditions in Calabria . They evoke so many cherished family memories. These Calabrian Christmas cookies are pretty unique because they skip butter and eggs. Instead, they use honey and a splash of milk. Really good stuff. The result? A tender dough with a hint of spice from cinnamon, giving each bite this cozy, sweet warmth. And look, the real treat comes with the finish—every cookie gets dipped in a thick layer of chocolate, which adds a satisfying snap and a smooth finish. Really, in Calabria, these cookies have been lovingly made for generations, especially during the holidays. And each family, you know, has its own version. While some compare them to regional delights like buccellati from Sicily or local turdilli, susumelle are way way different with their distinct flavor and texture.
During the holiday season, these Italian spiced biscuits fill the air with this inviting aroma of cinnamon and chocolate. Seriously good. They make any home feel extra welcoming. And, grandmothers? Usually the experts, sharing tips for keeping the exterior a bit crisp while ensuring the interior stays soft and moist. Susumelle are pretty sturdy, lasting well into the festivities, which makes them perfect for snacking or sharing throughout Christmas celebrations. A tray of susumelle cookies often finds its place alongside other traditional Italian cookies at family gatherings. Everyone reaches for just one more. Plus, throughout December, you’ll see them at every table in Calabria, marking the true start of the season. When you take a bite, you’re met with a really really good mix of spicy cinnamon, sweet honey, and bold chocolate—perfect for anyone who loves regional Italian pastries. No question. It’s no wonder these chocolate-coated biscuits are a favorite in festive cookie recipes across Southern Italy, capturing the heart of Calabrian culinary culture.
To prepare the susumelle, start by pouring the honey into a small pot , add the water , and heat it gently over low heat , just enough time to melt it.
In a separate bowl, sift the flour , baking powder , and cocoa .
Then add the ground cinnamon , granulated sugar , and milk at room temperature .
Also incorporate the now lukewarm honey and mix with your hands until you get a rather uniform mixture .
At this point, transfer it to a surface , dust with a little flour , and roll it out with a rolling pin
until you get a thickness of about 0.4 inches . Using an oval cookie cutter about 3.5 inches long, cut out your cookies and gently lift them using a spatula .
Transfer them gradually onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , spacing them well apart . Bake in a static oven on the middle rack at 375°F for about 15 minutes (temperature and times should be adjusted based on your oven, as soon as you see cracks on the surface of the cookies, it's time to take them out). Once ready, you can remove the tray from the oven
and let them cool on a wire rack . Continue baking the other cookies, kneading the leftover dough and rolling it out again. Allow your susumelle to cool completely and in the meantime melt the chocolate in a double boiler . When the chocolate is lukewarm, dip only the top of the cookies
and place them back on the wire rack . Let them dry at room temperature for about an hour and enjoy your susumelle for a special Christmas .
The susumelle can be stored for 2 weeks in an airtight container, preferably without the chocolate.
Instead of dark chocolate, you can use white chocolate and sprinkle with chopped nuts.
