To prepare the garlic and chili shrimp tapa, start by cleaning the shrimp: shell them and, with the help of a knife, remove the black intestine vein . Heat a pan with 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil over moderate heat ,
then add two cloves of garlic and let it turn golden . Meanwhile, prepare the chili: wash it, remove the stem , and cut it in half to remove all the seeds ,
then chop it finely and add it to the oil . As soon as the oil is flavored, add the shrimp and cook them on both sides for 3-4 minutes. Be careful not to overcook them otherwise they will lose flavor and become tough. Finally, adjust with salt and add pepper to taste . Serve your garlic and chili shrimp tapa immediately.

Tapas are typical dishes of the Spanish gastronomic tradition served in small portions during aperitifs or as appetizers, usually accompanied by alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages. A Spanish legend tells that the name "tapa" originates from the habit of covering the glass with a "tapa," a small plate, to protect it from insects. The empty plate was later filled with the delicacies that we can appreciate and enjoy today. Want to discover other types of tapas?
