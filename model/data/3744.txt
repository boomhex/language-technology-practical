To prepare orange jelly candies, grate the zest of a well-washed and dried orange , then squeeze the oranges and strain their juice . Pour it into a saucepan .
Set aside 2-3 teaspoons from the sugar amount in a bowl , while you add the rest to the orange juice . Then add the grated zest and cook over low heat. Let it boil for 5 minutes.
After the necessary time has passed, add the pectin to the reserved sugar amount and mix it into the boiling juice , stirring well with a whisk to prevent lumps and to completely dissolve the pectin. Finally, add the strained lemon juice . Stir for a few minutes and turn off the heat.
Now prepare a loaf pan or another mold of your choice: butter it and line it with baking paper cut into strips to better fit the sides . At this point, pour the orange mixture into the mold to reach a thickness of about 0.6 inches .
Let the jelly cool in a cool place, and when it reaches room temperature, transfer the mold to the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. After this time, remove the jelly and transfer it to a cutting board. Following the longer side, cut it into strips lengthwise, then cut into cubes or small rectangles . Place the granulated sugar in a bowl and dip the rectangles into the sugar , ensuring they are completely covered. The orange jelly candies are ready to be enjoyed .
Store the candies in a cool, dry place for 5-6 days to prevent the sugar, which is sensitive to moisture, from dissolving!
Have fun varying the flavor of the jelly candies with the juice of the fruit you like best. Additionally, instead of making simple cubes, try using silicone molds (even chocolate molds will work) to give your jelly candies different and original shapes.
