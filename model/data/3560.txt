First, prepare the spreads. In a blender, place the salmon , add the ricotta cheese and the tomato paste to make the salmon spread and set it aside.
Then proceed with the herb mousse, finely chop the aromatic herbs , add the fresh spreadable cheese (5-6) and mix well until everything is completely combined.
Then prepare the spread with pesto by adding it to the ricotta cheese and mix well again . Once the spreads are prepared, proceed to assemble the bread layers. Cut the crusts from the slices of sandwich bread and from the slices of white bread
and also from the whole wheat bread and place it at the bottom of a loaf pan measuring 10x3.5x2.75 inches, preferably with a removable bottom, then spread the salmon spread
smooth it well with a spatula and cover with slices of white sandwich bread , then spread the herb spread proceeding as with the first layer ,
then cover again with the whole wheat sandwich bread and proceed with the composition of the last layer with the pesto spread . Cover with the last layer of white sandwich bread. To completely cover the surface of the loaf, cut a slice into strips of thickness
which will serve to entirely cover the surface of the loaf . Then cover the bread with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator in the coldest part for at least 2-3 hours, or in the freezer for about half an hour, then unmold it and cut it into slices.
If you don't have a loaf pan with a removable bottom, line a classic loaf pan with parchment paper, so it will be easier to extract your three-flavor sandwich more easily.
