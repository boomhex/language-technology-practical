Whether you’re savoring it solo or sharing with friends, this cake is sure to become a favorite—capturing the core of Sicilian baking in every bite.
To prepare the pistachio plumcake, start by taking the vanilla pod, splitting it in two, extracting the seeds, and setting them aside ; alternatively, you can use a packet of vanillin. Put the room temperature butter together with the sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk and mix everything by turning on the machine. With the stand mixer running, also add the vanilla seeds to the butter and sugar mixture, then add the pistachio paste (if you can't find pistachio paste, you can make it yourself by finely grinding peeled pistachios),
the yogurt , the eggs one at a time , and the salt. When the eggs have mixed into the batter, also add the sifted flour and baking powder
and finally the chopped pistachios ; allow everything to blend until you get a thick and homogeneous mixture . If you do not have a stand mixer, you can use a whisk to mix, being careful to add the ingredients gradually to avoid lumps. Butter a 12x4x3 inch plumcake pan (with a capacity of 6 cups) and line it with parchment paper, pressing well against the sides to make the paper adhere on all sides .
Pour the batter into the pan , leveling it well on the surface with a spatula. Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 50 minutes (or in a convection oven at 320°F for 40 minutes) until the surface of the plumcake is golden . Remove the pistachio plumcake from the oven, let it cool slightly, then turn it out onto a serving plate, slice it , and enjoy!
The pistachio plumcake can be stored under a glass dome or in an airtight container at room temperature for 3-4 days. It is possible to freeze the plumcake once baked.
Tricks for dessert lovers: enrich the batter with a shower of dark chocolate chips or garnish it with a water icing. In both cases, you'll be licking your lips! 
If, on the other hand, you are pistachio purists, forgo the paste and peel the pistachios one by one, then chop them very finely in a mixer before using.
