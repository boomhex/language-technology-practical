To prepare the savory pie with phyllo dough in a pan with zucchini, first trim the zucchini and slice them into rounds . In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil, add the finely chopped onion and sauté for a few minutes, then add the zucchini and cook for about 5 minutes over medium heat.
Season with salt , stir, then add the spinach and cook for another 5 minutes or until the zucchini are tender and set aside.
Brush a pan with oil and 4-5 sheets of phyllo dough, on both sides , then place them in the pan to cover the bottom.
Add the zucchini with spinach and grated cheese . Close with the other sheets of phyllo dough, previously brushed .
Fold the edges inward and cook over low heat for about 5-6 minutes, then flip it as if it were an omelet and cook for another 5-6 minutes until the dough is golden and crispy. Your savory pie with phyllo dough and zucchini is ready to be enjoyed !
The savory pie with phyllo dough and zucchini should be consumed as soon as it is ready, but if there are leftovers, you can store it in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for 1-2 days.
Instead of grated cheese, you can use feta, salted ricotta, or smoked provolone for a bolder touch. For a heartier version, you can enrich the filling with diced cooked ham or bacon. Try replacing the zucchini with grilled eggplant, peppers, or artichokes for a new version each time.
