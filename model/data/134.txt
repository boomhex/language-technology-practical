instructions:
To prepare the venison roast, first clean the meat by removing the fat and sinews: you should obtain a compact and regular fillet for even cooking. Proceed with the How to tie a roast : once you make the first knot, create loops and continue to the end of the meat, finishing with a knot , and set aside. Use the trimmings to prepare the sauce: heat a drizzle of oil in a pot and add the meat trimmings .
Add the coarsely chopped onion , garlic , and sauté over high heat for 5-7 minutes until the meat gets a nice golden color. Then deglaze with red wine .
Add the tomato paste , juniper berries , bay leaf, rosemary, and sage and let all the alcohol evaporate.
Cover with water , salt , and pepper. Let it simmer over low heat for about 30 minutes .
Meanwhile, heat a pan, add 5 oz of butter and let it melt. Place the meat in the pan and season with salt and pepper .
Add the aromas: garlic , sage, rosemary , and juniper berries .
Once the bottom side is sealed, turn the roast and salt the other side . At this point, baste the roast , continuously drenching it with melted butter until well browned. Transfer the roast to a baking dish and cook in a static oven at 175°F for 10-15 minutes. The internal temperature of the meat should reach 118°F at the core.
Meanwhile, strain the sauce through a sieve into a saucepan and let it reduce further over medium heat for 10-15 minutes. For the side dish, remove the excess green part from the carrots but leave about 1 inch of the stalk, then peel them .
Boil the carrots in salted water for about 10 minutes . Now take care of the asparagus cleaning: trim the woody ends , peel the stems , and keep the tips intact.
Cook the asparagus in salted boiling water for 2-3 minutes . Drain the vegetables and melt the butter in a hot pan .
Place the vegetables in the pan and season with salt and pepper . Cook over high heat for a couple of minutes, then remove the asparagus from the pan and continue to brown the carrots for another 2 minutes. Set aside. At this point, sear the roast in the pan again: melt 2 oz of butter and add the roast . Sear over high heat for one minute on each side.
Everything is ready for plating: cut the meat into slices , arrange them on the plate , and add the vegetables .
Finish with the sauce and a carrot tuft . Your venison roast is ready to be served !
The venison roast can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 1-2 days, either sliced or whole.
Instead of red wine, if you want a more delicate flavor, you can use white wine.
You can vary the side dish by replacing the asparagus and carrots with roasted potatoes, sautéed mushrooms, or a creamy purée, which pairs perfectly with the strong flavor of venison.
