Place the mixture in the center of a sheet of parchment paper and use it to shape it into a meatloaf . Now remove the paper and transfer the meatloaf to a baking dish .
Pour the broth over the meatloaf and into the baking dish , then bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 45 minutes . During cooking, occasionally baste the meatloaf with the broth to ensure it remains moist .
When the meatloaf is golden on the surface, check with a meat probe that the internal temperature is at least 160°F, then remove from the oven and let it rest in the pan for 10-15 minutes ; this way, the juices will distribute evenly, keeping the meatloaf soft. After the resting time, your soft meatloaf is ready to be sliced and served !
The soft meatloaf can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days.
You can freeze it after cooking if you used fresh, not thawed ingredients.
If you don't have a thermometer, you can check the meatloaf's doneness by inserting a knife blade inside: if the juice that comes out is clear, it's ready!
You can replace the stale bread with breadcrumbs, adjusting the amount based on the consistency of the mixture.
