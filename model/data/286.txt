To prepare the broccoli and anchovies risotto, first clean the broccoli by cutting the florets , then divide them in half . Finely chop the shallot .
Cook the broccoli in salted boiling water for 5 minutes , then drain them . Set aside 20 florets for plating; transfer the rest to a pitcher and add a bit of water .
Blend with an immersion blender until a smooth and homogeneous cream is obtained . In a pot, heat the oil over medium heat, then add the shallot and sauté for a few minutes until the shallot becomes transparent.
Add the garlic and the fresh chili pepper cut in half . Let them flavor the oil for 2 minutes, then remove the garlic and chili pepper. Add the rice to the pot .
Season with salt and toast for 2 minutes, or until the rice grains become slightly translucent. Deglaze with white wine and let all the alcohol evaporate. Add vegetable broth and cook the rice, stirring often. Add a ladle of broth when the previous one has been absorbed.
