instructions:
To prepare the chicken with cauliflower and mustard sauce, first marinate the meat: place the chicken breasts in a bowl and add salt, pepper , thyme sprigs , and oil .
Massage the meat with your hands to season it evenly , then cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cut 4 slices from the whole cauliflower, about 0.39 inches thick . Coarsely chop the rest of the cauliflower and set it aside; it will be used to make the cream.
Heat a drizzle of oil in a non-stick pan, then lay the cauliflower slices , salt , and pepper them. Cook on high until golden (it will take a couple of minutes), then turn the slices, salt and pepper again, and brown the other side . Transfer the cauliflower slices to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and set aside.
In the same pan, heat another drizzle of oil and add the coarsely chopped cauliflower . Salt, pepper, and sauté over medium heat, being careful not to burn it. When it is golden, cover with water and continue cooking for 5-6 minutes until it breaks down. At this point, transfer the cauliflower to a container .
Pour a drizzle of oil and blend with an immersion blender to obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream .
Keep the cauliflower cream warm and move on to the mustard sauce: in a small bowl, combine the mustard, honey , apple cider vinegar , oil, and a pinch of salt. Mix the ingredients well and set aside.
Now take the chicken breasts: pour the marinade oil into a pan along with the thyme sprigs, then place the chicken breasts skin side down and cook over medium-high heat for 4-5 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Turn the chicken breasts and cook for a couple of minutes on the other side . Once ready, transfer the chicken breasts to the baking sheet where you placed the cauliflower slices .
Bake everything in fan mode at 392°F for 5 minutes . You're ready to plate: spread the cauliflower cream at the base of the plate , then add a slice of roasted cauliflower .
Place the chicken breast on top and garnish with mustard sauce . Finally, complete with a few fresh thyme leaves. Your chicken with cauliflower and mustard sauce is ready to be served !
Chicken with cauliflower and mustard sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for one day, in an airtight container.
The cauliflower cream can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator for 2 days. It can be frozen.
Free-range chicken is preferable for this recipe because it has thicker skin, which won't risk breaking during cooking. If you can't find it, you can use regular chicken breasts, adjusting the cooking times based on the thickness of the slices.
You can use any type of mustard you prefer for the sauce!
