instructions:
To prepare grilled vegetables, wash all the vegetables under abundant fresh running water and dry them. Slice the zucchini and eggplant into rounds about 1/4 inch thick (2-3);
take the bell peppers, remove the top, cut them in half , then with a knife remove the white filaments and seeds inside . Cut them into slices, then into fairly large cubes, and set aside .
Remove the stems from the tomatoes and slice them into rounds also about 1/4 inch thick . Once all the vegetables are sliced , heat a grill over the fire.
When the grill is very hot, cook the vegetables a few at a time: arrange the bell peppers side by side , grilling them for 5 minutes and turning them with kitchen tongs for even cooking , then place the zucchini on the grill
for 3 minutes and continue with the eggplant for another 3 minutes (14-15). Remember to always turn the vegetables for even cooking.
Finally, finish with the tomatoes, cooking them for 4 minutes until they are well grilled (16-17). Finally, you can serve your grilled vegetables, seasoning them with olive oil, salt, and pepper .
You can store grilled vegetables in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 2-3 days without seasoning.
Why not add even more flavor to our grilled vegetables? Try adding radicchio, shishito peppers, or onion. If you want to make the peppers more digestible, put them in the oven and grill them on a baking sheet or the oven grill, turning them on all sides until they are softened and well charred. Take them out of the oven and place them for 5 minutes inside a plastic bag, sealing it; after 5 minutes, remove the peppers and peel them (the skin will come off easily), then cut them into strips of the thickness you prefer.
