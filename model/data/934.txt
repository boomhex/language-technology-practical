instructions:
To make the delicious chestnut fritters, first prepare the batter: put the chestnut flour in a bowl along with the baking powder and sugar .
Gradually pour in the milk while stirring with a whisk to prevent lumps from forming , then add the egg , salt, and pepper. You should end up with a smooth and homogeneous mixture .
Heat the vegetable oil in a pan to a temperature of 340°F, then pour a spoonful of batter at a time, using 2 spoons to let it slide . Fry the fritters for 2 minutes on each side , then drain them on paper towels to remove the excess oil .
Cut the bresaola into strips about 1/4 inch thick . Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan, add the bresaola , and sauté over high heat for 3-4 minutes . Transfer the crispy bresaola to paper towels to absorb the excess oil and set aside.
Now put the ricotta in a bowl, add salt , pepper, and the grated lemon zest , then mix to combine everything.
You are ready to assemble your appetizer: place a quenelle of ricotta on each fritter using 2 spoons , then garnish with the crispy bresaola and finish with a grind of pepper and grated lemon zest. The delicious chestnut fritters are ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the delicious chestnut fritters as soon as they are ready.
Alternatively, you can prepare the different elements in advance and assemble them before serving. The fritter batter can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
You can flavor the ricotta cream with thyme or rosemary, if you prefer. Alternatively, you can use prosciutto or pancetta instead of bresaola!
