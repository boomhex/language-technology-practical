If you’ve ever wandered through a pastry shop in Northern Italy , you’ve probably spotted those charming S-shaped cookies called ‘biscotti esse.’ They’re crafted from a whipped shortcrust pastry called ‘pasta frolla montata,’ famous for their crispy exterior and tender, melt-in-your-mouth interior. And you know what? The real fun comes from the partial dip in dark chocolate, turning snacking into a delightful little game. People often, and I mean often, debate whether to start with the chocolate end or save it for last. But honestly, there’s no wrong choice. It’s a treat that makes you reach for more, with its smooth, not-too-sweet dough perfectly balanced by the rich chocolate. This combo? Keeps folks coming back.
When you step into a tea room in Lombardy or Veneto , you’ll spot these esse cookies alongside other homemade cookies and Italian classics. Their unique S-shape feels super inviting. The dough is piped, not rolled, giving each cookie an artisan twist—looks fancy, but it’s part of many easy cookie recipes in the region. Compared to your typical chocolate chip cookies recipe , esse cookies offer a delicate bite—less chewy, more crumbly and light, with a hint of moist texture as you reach the center. Seriously, the mix of golden crunch and bittersweet chocolate makes them perfect for anyone seeking the best cookie recipes or a fresh take on traditional cookie recipes . They're the kind of treat you set out for guests or enjoy as a special accompaniment to coffee or tea. One taste, and it’s easy—really easy—to see why these cookies have remained a beloved staple in Northern Italy for generations.
To prepare the S-shaped cookies, first place the cubed soft butter in a bowl . Then add the sugar and salt .
Then add the vanilla seeds and lemon zest . Mix everything with an electric beater .
until you get a well-whipped mass . Then add half of the eggs and work with the beater for a few more minutes .
When the eggs are well absorbed and the mixture is well whipped , add half of the flour . Continue mixing with the beater until fully absorbed. Then add the remaining eggs and mix again.
When they are completely absorbed, add the second part of the flour and work everything until you get a consistent and well-whipped mass . Then transfer the dough into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star nozzle .
Close the back of the pastry bag to prevent the dough from coming out the other side and shape the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. You should gently squeeze in the center and make an S motion . Continue like this until the tray is complete . Then, let it rest in the refrigerator for 5 minutes, then bake in a fan oven at 350°F for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, chop the dark chocolate ; then transfer 9 oz into one bowl and 1.5 oz into another. When the cookies are slightly golden, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely .
When the cookies are completely cool, melt the larger portion of chocolate until it reaches 113°F . The chocolate can be melted in a bain-marie or in the microwave. Once you reach the temperature of 113°F, also add the remaining chocolate .
Mix vigorously and bring the chocolate to a temperature of 86°F. At this point, you can dip the cookies halfway into the chocolate, removing the excess chocolate by lightly scraping the base on the edge of the bowl (26-27).
Then place them on a wire rack with parchment paper underneath and let the chocolate dry completely before serving your S-shaped cookies .
S-shaped cookies can be stored for 4-5 days in an airtight container.
It is not recommended to freeze the dough.
To make cocoa S-shapes, simply replace 1 oz of flour with 2/3 oz of unsweetened cocoa powder. For an extra touch, after dipping them in chocolate, you can sprinkle the S-shaped cookies with chopped hazelnuts or shredded coconut.
