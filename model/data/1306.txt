instructions:
To make the crispy Edam, first cut the cheese block into 8 cubes measuring 1.5x1.5 inches and 0.75 inches thick . Skewer each cube with a stick , with the given quantities, you'll obtain 8 pieces .
In a bowl, pour the all-purpose flour and cornmeal , and add the baking soda .
Season with chili pepper and salt . At this point, pour in the milk while stirring with a whisk.
Add the whole egg and the oil and mix again to blend the batter . On a tray, pour the coarsely ground breadcrumbs. Everything is ready for the breading: dip a skewer into the batter .
Then roll it in the breadcrumbs to coat it entirely . Once you're done breading the skewers, place them on a tray .
Heat the seed oil in a tall saucepan, and when it reaches 302°F, immerse one skewer at a time , frying for a few minutes, just enough time to brown the breading. Once cooked, drain the crispy Edam skewers on a tray lined with absorbent paper and serve them hot and stringy .
We recommend consuming the crispy Edam immediately.
You can prepare the crispy Edam in advance and keep the skewered and breaded cubes until frying.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you don't like chili pepper, you can use sweet paprika to give color and flavor to the batter, and if you enjoy aromatic notes, add some chopped herbs like thyme or rosemary.
