instructions:
To prepare the codfish salad, first bring a pot full of water to a boil and immerse the whole cod fillet . Add the white wine and lemon zest .
Also flavor with juniper berries , lemon juice , and parsley .
Cook for about 35 minutes . Meanwhile, peel the oranges, removing the peel and extracting the segments without the white part .
Move on to the parsley sauce: finely chop the parsley , then transfer it to a small bowl and add the oil , salt , and pepper.
Also add the lemon juice and mix well to emulsify . At this point, the cod will be cooked, so drain it and remove the skin. Divide the fillet into flakes, being careful to remove the bones .
You are ready to assemble the salad: spread a bed of arugula on the serving platter , then place the cod on top and distribute the Taggiasca olives .
Add the orange segments and finally drizzle with the parsley sauce . Your codfish salad is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the codfish salad immediately. If necessary, it can be stored in the refrigerator for one day in an airtight container.
If using half a cod fillet, also halve the cooking time.
If you don't like the slightly bitter note of arugula, you can replace it with lamb's lettuce.
Enrich the codfish salad with walnut kernels for a crunchy touch!
