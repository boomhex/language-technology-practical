instructions:
To make the Mediterranean gazpacho, first cut the bread into small cubes , then spread them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and season with oil , salt, and dried oregano .
Toast the bread in a convection oven at 428°F for 4 minutes or until it is golden brown . Now wash the celery, remove the base, and then cut it into small pieces . Wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them in half .
Place the cherry tomatoes in a blender , add the drained peppers , and the celery .
At this point, season with olive oil , salt, and vinegar . Blend the mixture until a puree is obtained, and pass it through a sieve
to retain the tomato seeds . You will obtain a thick and homogeneous mixture . Now clean the spring onion and slice it finely .
Pour the gazpacho into the serving dish, garnish with rings of spring onion , toasted bread croutons , and pieces of ricotta .
Perfume the dish with fresh basil leaves and season with a drizzle of raw olive oil . Serve the Mediterranean gazpacho immediately !
The Mediterranean gazpacho can be stored without croutons and ricotta for a couple of days in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap. We do not recommend freezing it.
If you do not like the acidic note of wine vinegar, you can add rice vinegar which has a milder flavor. Those who love spicy notes can season the croutons with chili powder.
