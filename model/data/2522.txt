These rustic appetizers hail from Southern Italy, where people love mixing up a spread of small bites for parties and birthdays. And the options? Seriously good.

Italian finger foods are different—no question—because they’re not just easy to share but also quick to whip up when you’re expecting a crowd. And you know what?

In Southern Italy, it’s totally normal to see these at birthdays or relaxed family hangouts. Everyone gathers around—grabs their favorite—and it's all good. The golden pastry, those tender bites of cheese and ham, little crispy pizzas with tomato sauce—they bring the crowd-pleasing flavors. The kind that make Italian gatherings warm and relaxed. Also, the multicultural twist? Like, with Greek feta sneaking into some pastries. It adds a little kick to the usual Italian party food lineup. With so many options, these puff pastry snacks show off what’s great about easy Italian recipes—lots of variety, no fuss, and plenty of flavor in every savory bite. Perfect for anyone who just wants good food and a fun time with friends. Whether it's a big party or a simple get-together, these tasty bites are bound to be a hit.
To prepare the fantasy of savoury pastries, start with the ham and mozzarella rolls. Slice the mozzarella into 6 portions. Take the pastry discs out of the package , remove the plastic wrap they are on and place them on a work surface: place a slice of mozzarella in the center and, on top, a slice of ham folded in half. Moisten the edges of the disc with water, using a kitchen brush .
Fold the pastry disc over itself to form a half-moon , which you can seal by pressing the edges with the tines of a fork . Continue until you have 6 rolls and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Proceed with the spinach triangles. Wash and dry the greens, then transfer them to a pan drizzled with olive oil ,
cover them with a lid and cook the spinach for 3-4 minutes. Dice the feta cheese. Now place 3 pastry discs on the work surface and cut them in half to get 6 triangles. On each piece of pastry, place a tuft of spinach and, on top, a cube of feta. Brush the edges with water or beaten egg, using a kitchen brush . Fold each half over itself and press the edges with a fork to seal them .
Place the triangles on the baking sheet alongside the ham and mozzarella rolls, then brush the surface of all the pastries with a beaten egg . Set them aside and proceed with the mini sausages. Place a pastry disc on the work surface and cut it into 6 strips with a pastry cutter . Take the 6 mini sausages and wrap each one with a strip of pastry, stretching it gently .
Place the mini sausages on the baking sheet, then brush them with the beaten egg and sprinkle with poppy seeds . Preheat the oven to 392°F for 10 minutes (if fan-assisted, 356°F for 8 minutes). Meanwhile, prepare the mini pizzas. Dice the scamorza cheese, then place 4 pastry discs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and gently add a spoonful of tomato sauce in the center, leaving the edges free . Top the mini pizzas with the diced scamorza and place half an anchovy on each .
Take out the first pastries: they should be beautifully golden . Now bake the mini pizzas, again in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 10 minutes (if fan-assisted, 356°F for 8 minutes): these too should be golden and crispy. Your fantasy of savoury pastries is ready .
You can store the pastries for 2 days in an airtight container. You can freeze them in the same way.
If you wish, you can really get creative with fillings and toppings: choose, for example, bresaola and burrata, zucchini and parmesan, white pizza with mushrooms and cream, sesame seeds...
