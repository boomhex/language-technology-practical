instructions:
To make the zongzi, first place the bamboo leaves in a large enough container , cover them with water , and place a weight on top to keep them submerged . Leave them to soak for 12 hours.
Cut the meat into slices about 0.8 inches thick and cut into small pieces . Place them in a bowl and season with light and dark soy sauce .
Add sugar , salt , pepper, and rice wine .
Mix well , cover with plastic wrap , and let marinate for 2 hours. In the meantime, rinse the rice under running water 2-3 times .
Pour the rice into a bowl and season with salt , light and dark soy sauce . Mix well and set aside .
After the soaking time, rinse the bamboo leaves under running water, then clean them with a cloth on both sides to remove impurities . Slightly overlap 2 leaves , then fold them to form a kind of cone open on one side .
Hold the cone on the palm of your hand and insert a small handful of rice , then add 2 or 3 pieces of meat and cover with more rice ; the rice at the base should be about one-third of the total filling of each zongzi.
Fold the edges of the leaves to form a triangular shape and close by wrapping the package with several turns of kitchen twine . Continue in the same way until all ingredients are used up; with these quantities, you will get 20 pieces. For convenience, you can tie the ends of the twine of 4-5 zongzi together so they will be easier to drain.
Immerse the zongzi in a large pot filled with plenty of water , cover with the lid, and bring to a boil over high heat. When the water starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and continue cooking for 2 hours . After cooking time, remove the zongzi from the water .
Remove the twine and gently open the bamboo leaves . Your zongzi are ready to be enjoyed !
Cooked zongzi can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
You can freeze them after cooking, then reheat them by steaming or in boiling water before consumption.
It is recommended to soak the bamboo leaves the night before or in the morning for the evening.
Glutinous rice, once cooked, is particularly sticky; despite the name, it contains no gluten.
