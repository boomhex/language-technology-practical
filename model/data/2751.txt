Tagliatelle integrali con scarola e fonduta di taleggio is one of those classic Italian dishes that's got a little something extra—really, it's got it all. Straight from Lombardy , this one's a gem. Whole wheat tagliatelle ? Yeah, not your usual pasta, but it’s got this nutty flavor and a tender bite that just works great. It's not your typical sauce setup either. Instead, you've got sautéed escarole —which, to be honest, adds a nice bit of bitterness and crunch.
And look, adding raisins? Genius move. Those bursts of sweetness really wake up your taste buds. All this under a smooth, silky layer of taleggio fondue , which is super creamy and comforting. And here's the thing: you don't see escarole recipes like this too often, especially with a taleggio cheese sauce that melts perfectly into everything. It's seriously good stuff.
Folks from Northern Italy—especially Lombardy—are basically cheese wizards, and this taleggio fondue proves it. They can take something simple, like whole wheat pasta , and make it feel way way special. You've got the moist sauce, the slightly crisp edges from the sautéed escarole, and those soft, golden tagliatelle ribbons. Pretty simple. It's a go-to if you're into Italian vegetarian vibes or just need a pasta night shake-up.
Every forkful gives you the creamy, rich cheese, pops of sweet raisins, and that little tang from the greens. Fancy? Kinda. But, truthfully, just good, simple food with a cool Italian twist. Perfect for a cozy dinner. It’s like bringing a taste of Lombardy to your table. Each bite? Comforting and exciting. For sure.
To make the whole wheat tagliatelle with escarole and taleggio fondue, start with the fresh pasta: pour the whole wheat flour into a large bowl, make a well in the center to create the classic fountain shape, and crack one egg at a time that you've kept at room temperature. Knead with your hands (2-3)
until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough, wrap it with plastic wrap and place it in a cool, draft-free place for 30 minutes (not in the refrigerator). Take care of the sauce, rinse the raisins and soak them for 10 minutes in cold water to rehydrate them , wash the escarole under running water
then cut it into strips . In a pan, sauté the garlic clove with a drizzle of olive oil , add the escarole ,
cover with a lid and let the vegetable wilt for a few minutes . Then add the drained raisins .
Meanwhile, heat another pan on the stove and toast the almond slices and set them aside. After the resting time, take back the fresh pasta, divide the dough into pieces and roll each piece into a thin sheet with the special manual or electric machine .
Pass the sheet through the widest rollers to the thinnest ones, then pass it through the serrated roller to create the traditional tagliatelle . Scatter the tagliatelle creating nests and place them on a floured tray to avoid sticking . Prepare the taleggio fondue: cut the taleggio into pieces
heat the milk in a saucepan and in another, melt the butter over low heat, salt pepper, sprinkle in the flour
and mix with a whisk to obtain a golden roux . Gradually add the hot milk , thicken the mixture over low heat, always stirring with the whisk, flavor with nutmeg, salt, pepper, and then add the pieces of taleggio ,
stir to melt the cheese and obtain a sort of béchamel . Remove the garlic clove from the escarole and dress it with the taleggio fondue . Meanwhile, bring plenty of salted water to a boil for cooking the tagliatelle, cook the tagliatelle for just a few minutes
then drain them into the pan with the escarole and fondue and keep a little cooking water aside to add to the pasta if it turns out a little dry. Garnish with toasted almond slices , stir to flavor the pasta and immediately bring the whole wheat tagliatelle with escarole and taleggio fondue to the table to enjoy them hot !
It is recommended to consume the tagliatelle immediately. Alternatively, you can prepare the dough the day before and store it in the refrigerator, being careful to add an egg white or some water when kneading to keep the dough softer to prevent it from drying out. You can freeze the tagliatelle nests or vacuum seal them.
As an alternative to taleggio, you can use fontina or a milder flavored cheese like young asiago. If you don't like escarole, use chard or beet greens which have a sweeter taste, or if you love strong flavors, try the variant with broccoli rabe.
