To prepare the tuna poke, start by preparing the rice. The rice should be rinsed well under cold water until the water is clear . Pour it into a tall pot with equal weight of water (in our case 500 g/1.1 lbs) , turn on the heat to high, with a lid and cook without stirring for 2 minutes, then lower the heat and continue cooking for another 10 minutes: you should never remove the lid or stir. The rice consistency should be slightly al dente.
Meanwhile, prepare the rice vinegar mixture, which will give a slightly tangy taste to the rice. In a small saucepan, pour the vinegar and salt . Heat over medium-low heat to dissolve the salt, then add the sugar . Stir and turn off the heat . Let it cool.
When the rice is ready, you can place it in a large wooden container (or other non-steel material). If you use a wooden container, we recommend wetting it with water first, then emptying it: this way, the wood will not absorb the vinegar. Pour the rice into the container and add the vinegar mixture by letting it trickle onto a wooden paddle , to spread it more gently and evenly over the rice. Stir the rice by moving it with the edge of the wooden paddle, so as not to crush it . It's important to mix until the grains are glossy and well seasoned.
Wait for it to cool, stirring gently from time to time, and then you can cover it with a damp cloth to prevent it from sticking . In the meantime, deal with the rest: peel the mango , cut it into slices and make cubes of about 2 cm (approximately 3/4 inch) with the pulp . Slice the green onion, cutting off the green part.
Proceed with the avocado: cut it in half , peel it and slice it. You can drizzle with lemon juice to prevent it from browning . Cut the cherry tomatoes into 4 parts .
Prepare the mayonnaise with a tablespoon of sriracha sauce. Coarsely chop the peanuts . Slice the tuna thinly, as if it were sashimi , or if you prefer, into cubes. Now you can assemble the tuna poke: place the rice at the base of the bowl, wetting your hands first. Add the vegetables, fruit, seaweed, and tuna, creating separate piles. Complete with sprouts, seaweed, and sauce. Decorate with sesame seeds, peanut granules, some soy sauce, and serve .
We recommend consuming the poke immediately.
The rice can be prepared in advance.
If you prefer, you can slightly marinate the tuna with soy sauce and, if you like, also lemon.
You can vary the sauce and vegetables according to your taste.
The most suitable rice is Nishiki, found in the best stores selling oriental products. As an alternative rice grown in Italy, you can choose a low-starch rice, such as Originario.
If you can't find sriracha sauce, replace it with a few drops of Tabasco.
You can use fresh soybean sprouts or blanch them in water and vinegar for 20 seconds.
Before consuming raw, marinated, or not perfectly cooked fish, it is recommended to freeze for at least 96 hours at -0.4 degrees Fahrenheit in a domestic freezer marked with 3 or more stars, as per guidelines from the Ministry of Health .
