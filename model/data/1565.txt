instructions:
To make the potato pie, boil the potatoes for about 35-40 minutes or until they are soft. Meanwhile, place the chicken in a saucepan with the bay leaf and salt
and a quart of water , cook for 30 minutes. Once the chicken is ready let it cool and then use your hands to debone and shred the meat .
Place the chicken in a bowl and season with chopped rosemary , salt, pepper, and grated lemon zest . Set aside, then take the cooked and still warm potatoes and pass them through a potato ricer, collecting the puree in a bowl .
Season the puree with Parmesan , salt, pepper, then add the egg and mix everything well .
Oil the bottom of a baking dish measuring about 12x8 inches and line it with about four heaping tablespoons of mashed potatoes , pressing the bottom well to make it even . Add the seasoned chicken
Slice the scamorza cheese thinly and distribute a layer over the chicken . Transfer the remaining potato puree into a piping bag
and distribute it evenly , smoothing the surface with a spatula . Finally, season with a drizzle of oil ;
a bit of pepper and a few sprigs of rosemary . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 25 minutes, then switch to grill mode for another 8 minutes. Once cooked, remove your chicken and potato pie from the oven, let it cool slightly, and then serve at the table .
Store the potato pie in the fridge covered with plastic wrap and consume it within 3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Enrich your pie with sautéed mushrooms, béchamel, or sautéed onions!
