Today we present a recipe that will make true cheese lovers happy, those who love to enjoy it in its purest form: Parmesan fondue! A velvety cream , easy and quick to prepare, inspired by the classic Valdostana fondue . Ideal to serve as an appetizer or main dish, it is excellent accompanied by toasted bread croutons, but nothing prevents you from adding potatoes and cured meats in the manner of the Reblochon Fondue ! Moreover, Parmesan fondue can transform into a delicious sauce for Paccheri with radicchio and fontina fondue or gnocchi… and you, how do you prefer to enjoy it?
To prepare the Parmigiano Reggiano DOP fondue, pour the fresh cream into a small pot and start to heat it over medium heat, then add part of the grated Parmigiano Reggiano DOP and stir with a wooden spoon .

The Parmesan fondue can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days; before serving, you can reheat it in a double boiler or microwave.
