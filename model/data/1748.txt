At this point, cut the tuna into cubes ; wash well, dry, and roughly chop the bitter herbs . Pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, add the garlic and chili pepper . Let them gently sauté,
then add the cherry tomatoes . Stir to flavor them, and after a couple of minutes, also add the tuna cubes . Stir well and add the herbs .
Raise the heat and deglaze with the white wine . Meanwhile, roughly chop some mint leaves and add them to the seasoning . Lower the heat and let cook for about ten minutes.
In the meantime, cook the pasta in plenty of boiling water, salted to taste . Drain it al dente directly into the pan with the seasoning, add a ladle of cooking water , toss again for 1-2 minutes to complete cooking, and plate . Serve the pasta with tuna, herbs, and cherry tomatoes while still hot.
