To prepare gratinated rice with vegetables, use a large wok that can contain all the rice and vegetables. Start by wilting the chopped onion in a little oil, without browning it. Once it becomes translucent, add the chopped chili pepper. Peel the ginger root and grate it directly into the sauté . At this point, add the vegetables one at a time, in order of cooking time, and season with 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. Begin with the carrots cut into rounds, cook them with the soy sauce for about 5 minutes, then add the cabbage cut into not too thin strips and another 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. Cover the wok with the lid and let it cook for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, boil the rice in plenty of salted water . Add another two tablespoons of soy sauce and let it season by stirring the vegetables. At the end of cooking, add the diced tomatoes , more sauce and let it season, continuing to stir for a few moments, then remove from heat. Separately, sauté the mushrooms in a pan with a drizzle of oil and add them to the rest of the preparation. Drain the rice Meanwhile, you will have cooked the rice in salted water, leaving it quite al dente (subtract a couple of minutes from the cooking time recommended on the package) and pour it into the wok along with the sautéed vegetables, add the diced scamorza cheese , mix well and arrange everything in an ovenproof dish. Sprinkle the surface of the rice with the vegetables with Grana Padano and gratinate the rice with vegetables in the very hot oven until the surface is well browned , using a fairly high shelf and the grill. If necessary, spray some water or broth on the surface of the rice to achieve better browning. Serve the gratinated rice hot.
Gratinated rice with vegetables can be made at any time of the year. Choose seasonal vegetables and try to combine them as you like; however, when cooking them, try to add them starting with the vegetables with longer cooking times.
