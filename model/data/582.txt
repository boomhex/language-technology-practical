instructions:
To prepare the mochi, first heat water in a saucepan and pour it boiling over the sugar . Add the rice flour and mix with a whisk .
Once the ingredients are gathered , transfer the dough onto a work surface and knead until it forms a homogeneous dough ball .
Take the dough ball and roll it out to form logs, cut them into smaller pieces .
Make small chunks . Roll out the dough with a rolling pin to create small discs .
Wash and dry the strawberries, then remove the stem . Wrap the strawberry with the dough disc and seal the end .
You should obtain a cone shape resembling the strawberry . Boil the Mochi for a few minutes until they float to the surface .
Then roll them in shredded coconut . The mochi are ready to be enjoyed .
We recommend consuming the mochi immediately.
You can store them in the fridge in an airtight container for a couple of days.
To better fold the dough discs around the strawberries, slightly moisten your hands.
If you want sweeter mochi, sprinkle them with sugar before the shredded coconut.
Glutinous rice is a sweet and very sticky Asian rice, contrary to its name, it does not contain gluten.
