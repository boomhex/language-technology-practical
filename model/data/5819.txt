To make brownies, begin by finely chopping the dark chocolate. Melt it using a bain-marie or in the microwave, and then transfer it to a bowl . Melt the butter and combine it with the melted chocolate . Mix well using a spatula and set aside to cool.
In the meantime, toast the hazelnuts in a pan and set them aside. In a separate, large bowl, combine the eggs and sugar . Add a pinch of salt and beat the mixture using an electric whisk until it's light in color and frothy .
After the egg mixture is prepared, gradually incorporate the cooled melted chocolate and butter mixture , stirring continuously. Next, sift the flour and cocoa powder into the bowl .
Combine the sifted powders into the wet ingredients, stirring until you achieve a glossy and consistent batter . Add in the toasted hazelnuts and fold them in using a spatula .
Prepare a baking dish by lining it with parchment paper . Pour the brownie batter into the dish, ensuring a smooth surface . Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F for 25 minutes .
Once baked, remove the brownies from the oven and allow them to cool completely . After they've cooled, cut them into squares . Your brownies are now ready to be savored !
Brownies can be stored for 3-4 days at room temperature. You can freeze them after baking.
After adding the melted chocolate, you can enhance the brownie batter's flavor with cinnamon, ginger, or tonka bean.
Consider replacing the hazelnuts with other toasted nuts such as almonds, walnuts, pecans, or peanuts!
For a deeper chocolate intensity, opt for a dark chocolate that's 65-70% cocoa.
You might also try substituting up to 50% of the butter with coconut oil for a richer, fruitier flavor!
