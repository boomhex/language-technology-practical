The Crostata Salata Rustica alla Birra is, without a doubt, a standout dish—really elevates any gathering. Especially in Lombardy, northern Italy, where locals have totally nailed the art of making a crostata salata that's not only satisfying but also super appealing to the eyes. Seriously. And you know what? What truly sets this dish apart is its crispy beer-flavored crust, known as pasta brisée alla birra . The beer gives the crust a unique twist, making each bite extra golden and flavorful—really really flavorful. The filling? It's just as amazing, with tender mini zucchinis, creamy ricotta, and hearty luganiga sausage . So so good. This mix ensures every slice is moist and rich, offering way way more flavor than your typical torta salata. The rustic look and bold taste make it a real showstopper at any table.
In Lombardy, the crostata rustica is a go-to. Honestly, it's perfect when you need something practical yet impressive. Plus, even though it takes some time to prepare, here's the deal: you can make it in advance and just reheat it. Perfect for parties or family gatherings. It serves wonderfully as an antipasto rustico or can be the star if sliced into generous wedges. And listen, the beer-infused crust provides a satisfying crunch and a savory note that pairs beautifully with the soft cheese and sausage. It’s often cut into cubes for buffets, where it disappears fast thanks to the crostata alla birra element. A classic ricetta tradizionale italiana , no question, that's special yet manageable for home cooks looking to impress with something unique. Whether you call it a crostata salata con birra or just a really good savory pie, it's sure to spark conversations and have guests coming back for more. It really embodies the heart and soul of Italian cooking, offering a taste of Lombardy’s rich culinary tradition that's both delicious and accessible.
To make the rustic savory tart with beer, first prepare the shortcrust pastry: place the flour, cold diced butter, and a pinch of salt in a food processor with blades and blend until you get a sandy, floury mixture . At this point, arrange the mixture into a fountain on a work surface ,
adding the cold beer (4-5), knead everything quickly
ensuring the work surface is well floured until you get a smooth and fairly elastic dough . Once ready, wrap the shortcrust pastry in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 40 minutes.
Now focus on the filling: skin the luganiga sausage , place it in a pan with a drizzle of oil and cook for a few minutes until browned. Deglaze with the beer and continue cooking for 15 minutes, turn off the heat and let cool.
Now clean the zucchini flowers: detach them from the zucchinis by cutting at the base and remove the central pistil , then cut the zucchinis into thin slices and place them in a bowl with a pinch of salt to remove excess water.
In another bowl, place the ricotta after passing it through a fine mesh strainer to make it creamy . Add the milk to further soften the ricotta and the beaten eggs then mix everything well.
Add the grated Parmesan cheese . Drain the zucchinis to remove excess water, add them to the ricotta mixture and stir to incorporate. Also add the zucchini flowers
and the sausage , mix then season with salt and pepper to taste and add the marjoram leaves . At this point, take the shortcrust dough, take 2/3 of the dough to form the base and roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 0.4 inches .
Place the rolled-out dough on a 10-inch diameter pan lined with baking paper that has been moistened and squeezed (to soften it so it adheres better to the pan), using a rolling pin ; remove the excess edges by rolling over the surface with the rolling pin and pressing slightly and fit the dough inside, pressing well along the edges. Pour the ricotta, sausage, and vegetable mixture into the tart pan . Level the mixture with a spoon or spatula.
Now take the remaining shortcrust pastry, roll it out again to a thickness of 0.2 inches and cut strips about 0.4 inches wide with a fluted pastry cutter . Now apply the strips obtained on the surface of the tart , spacing them a couple of inches apart and attaching them at the ends first in one direction
and then in the other, intersecting them diagonally to form lozenges . Always using the leftover pastry, cut out small circles with a round cutter about 1 inch in diameter or with an apple corer and place them all around the tart as decoration .
Poke the circles in the center with a wooden skewer . Finally, brush the tart with the beaten egg yolk . Bake the rustic savory tart with beer in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 1 hour (or in a fan oven at 320°F for 50 minutes). When the surface is golden, remove the rustic savory tart with beer from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.
You can store the rustic savory tart with beer in the refrigerator for 3 days. You can freeze it in portions for easier thawing later.
If you can't find zucchini flowers, use sliced carrots to balance the dish's flavor.
