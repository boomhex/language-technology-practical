To prepare the green spaghetti alla chitarra with cacio e pepe, start with the dough: in a pan, place the washed spinach , cover with a lid , and let them wilt for about 5 minutes, or until softened .
Squeeze them well by pressing them on a colander , then transfer them to a mixer to chop them . Set aside; you will need 7 oz of chopped spinach.
In a bowl, add the flour and eggs , then mix with a fork to combine the ingredients .
Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead energetically for about 10 minutes until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough. Form a dough ball, cover it with the bowl, and let it rest for 30 minutes .
Take the dough ball and place it on the floured surface , cut off 1/3 using a dough scraper or a knife . Keep the rest of the dough covered to prevent it from drying out. Roll the dough ball with a rolling pin .
You need to get a rectangular sheet with a thickness of 1/12 inch (2 mm) . Try to make a rectangle that fits the size of your chitarra. Now lift the pasta by rolling it around the rolling pin and unroll it onto the chitarra . Roll the rolling pin over the pasta, pressing firmly to cut the sheet with the strings and thus obtain the typical spaghetti . Continue this way with the rest of the dough.
Form a nest with the spaghetti alla chitarra, lightly flouring them, then set them aside at room temperature . Meanwhile, bring water to a boil for cooking the spaghetti. Now prepare the cacio e pepe sauce: in a bowl, add the finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, add a ladle of pasta cooking water , and mix vigorously with a whisk or a spatula. You should get a smooth and lump-free paste. Cook the spaghetti in boiling water for 2-3 minutes.
Now grind the black pepper in a pan and toast it for a few moments to intensify its aromas and flavors . Add a ladle of pasta cooking water and drain the spaghetti into the pan .
Let the pasta cook for another minute, then turn off the heat and add the Pecorino paste . Adjust the consistency with a ladle of pasta cooking water and mix . Finish with grated lemon zest .
Serve the green spaghetti alla chitarra with cacio e pepe, garnishing the plates with more lemon zest and ground black pepper . Enjoy them hot and creamy !
Consume the green spaghetti alla chitarra with cacio e pepe immediately to preserve their creaminess. You can freeze the green spaghetti alla chitarra raw. To freeze, place the nests well spaced on a tray and put them in the freezer to harden for a couple of hours. Once well hardened, transfer them to freezer bags and store them again in the freezer. When ready to use, cook them directly from frozen in boiling water and proceed as per the recipe.
If you don't have a mixer, you can chop the spinach with a knife.
