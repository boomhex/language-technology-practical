instructions:
Clean the octopus under running water, removing the entrails, the central beak , the eyes , and as much as possible of the slimy film covering the octopus.
Now cut the octopus into pieces no larger than a walnut ; cutting into larger pieces would only result in longer cooking times. In a pan, pour the oil and add the whole garlic cloves to brown , add the bay leaves, the chili pepper cut into small pieces , making sure to remove all or part of the seeds if a less spicy dish is desired.
Now add the octopus pieces and sauté them for a few moments, then add the red wine , a bit of chopped parsley , bring back to a boil and lower the heat; cover with a lid and cook for at least 40/50 minutes depending on the toughness of the octopus itself. If the sauce reduces too much, add a few tablespoons of water. A few moments before removing the drunken octopus from the heat, add a generous handful of chopped parsley, adjust the salt and let it cool for a few minutes.
If you like a rather thick cooking base, let the drunken octopus cool for a few minutes right after cooking: as it cools, the cooking base tends to become thicker thanks to the gelatin contained in the octopus itself.
To define the drunken octopus as a seafood main dish is somewhat limiting, given the many possibilities of using it during lunch or dinner. In addition to being an excellent main dish, drunken octopus can also be enjoyed cold, as in a salad, or used to prepare original bruschettas. Another very valid solution is to dress a good plate of spaghetti with the extremely flavorful cooking base, perhaps taking care to chop part of the octopus into smaller pieces.
