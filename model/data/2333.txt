To prepare sedani rigati with Catalan-style shrimp, start by How to clean shrimp . Remove the head with your hands , and gently extract the shell , keeping the scraps aside to make the bisque. Make an incision along the back of each shrimp and, using tweezers, remove the intestine .
Place the shrimp meat in the fridge and proceed to make the Shellfish Stock . Peel an onion and cut it into quarters, clean the leek by removing the ends and the green leaves, then slice it thinly. Melt the butter in a large saucepan and when it's melted, add the onion, leek, and garlic . Let everything brown and soften, then add the shellfish carcasses and let them brown for a couple of minutes over high heat, stirring with a wooden spoon and crushing the heads. Deglaze with white wine and only when the alcohol has evaporated, add water to fully cover the shells. Add the parsley, black peppercorns, and season with salt .
Lower the heat and let it simmer gently for at least 60 minutes. During cooking, skim the broth with a skimmer , ensuring you rinse it each time to remove any residue. After the indicated time, the broth should have reduced to about half of the initial liquid, strain it with a fine-mesh sieve , and set aside your hot broth .
Wash the cherry tomatoes, cut them into quarters , and place them in a bowl. Season with salt , half the indicated amount of oil , and basil torn by hand.
Peel the onion, cut it into quarters , and from each quarter, cut thin slices . Transfer them to a bowl and completely cover the onions with cold water, add the vinegar , and let them soak for about ten minutes, making them more digestible.
Place a couple of ladles of the hot bisque in a pan, add the pasta , and cook it as if it were a risotto, adding another ladle of shellfish broth only when the previous one has almost evaporated and stirring occasionally. If necessary, once the broth is finished, add some boiling water to finish cooking the pasta .
While your pasta is cooking, sear the shrimp in a pan with the remaining oil for a few minutes over high heat . Drain the onions and set them aside. Once the pasta is cooked, turn off the heat and add the cherry tomatoes .
Add the onion slices and shrimp and mix everything . Then serve your sedani rigati with Catalan-style shrimp while still hot .
Store the sedani rigati with Catalan-style shrimp for up to 1 day in the refrigerator in an airtight container.
