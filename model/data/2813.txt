To make the salted caramel macarons, start by preparing the macaron shells: blend the almond flour with the powdered sugar to create a finer mixture and then sift it with a large-mesh strainer , add 75 g egg whites
mix the mixture with a wooden spoon to bind the ingredients . Cover the mixture with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature. Now, take care of the sugar syrup. Place a small pot on the stove, pour in the sugar and water , and bring the syrup to 250°F, using a candy thermometer to check the temperature. When the syrup reaches 241°F
start whipping the other 75 g of egg whites with a stand mixer or electric beaters, and when the syrup reaches 250°F, slowly pour it into the mixer with the egg whites while continuing to whip; add the instant coffee powder until the syrup has cooled and the meringue is glossy and frothy.
Incorporate the meringue into the almond flour mixture a little at a time , gently folding with a spatula to obtain a smooth and soft dough. Transfer the mixture into a piping bag with a plain nozzle, then prepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, greasing the tray to help the paper adhere better. Pipe small discs of mixture, well-spaced, about 1.5 inches in diameter . Let the mounds rest for at least 20 minutes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper so they will slightly flatten on their own and become perfectly smooth on the surface. Bake the macarons in a preheated convection oven at 320°F for 10 minutes (static mode is not recommended), and once cooked, turn off the oven and leave the macarons for another two minutes with the door half-open to dry them (to help with this operation, you can wedge a spoon in the opening to keep the oven door ajar). Once dried, remove the macarons and transfer them to a wire rack to cool.
Now take care of the caramel: place a pot on the stove and gradually add the sugar , allowing it to melt and brown over low heat. Do not stir the sugar at this stage of preparation, but only swirl the pot. Meanwhile, heat the cream, and when the caramel is smooth , incorporate the hot cream .
Mix the syrup with a whisk and add the salt and the cold butter cut into small cubes . Continue mixing until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture, then emulsify it with an immersion blender .
At this point, the syrup is ready , transfer it to a shallow, wide bowl, cover it with plastic wrap , and place it in the refrigerator to set. Assemble the macarons: transfer the caramel into a piping bag with a plain nozzle .
Fill the macarons by piping a dollop of caramel onto the flat side of half of the discs , then close with another disc, applying light pressure . Your coffee and salted caramel macarons are ready to be enjoyed .
Store the unfrosted salted caramel macarons under a glass dome or in a tin box for 2-3 days. You can store the caramel sauce separately in the refrigerator in a jar for 4-5 days.
Want to make colored macarons? Don't worry, just replace the coffee with a few drops of food coloring in the dough until you get the desired shade. If you don't like the salted note, just omit the salt in the caramel preparation.
