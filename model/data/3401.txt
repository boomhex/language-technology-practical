Pour the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil into a pan, let it heat slightly, then add the diced salmon , browning it for about 5 minutes until a golden crust forms . Cook the pasta al dente in plenty of boiling salted water, salted to taste .
Then drain it, reserving the cooking water and add it to the pan with the peas , adding a ladle of the pasta cooking water .
Finally, add the diced salmon and stir to mix the ingredients well . Turn off the heat and season with black pepper to taste; serve the tagliolini with salmon and peas still hot .
