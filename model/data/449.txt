instructions:
To prepare the oriental rolls, first make a sauté with oil, garlic, and chili pepper. Heat to infuse the flavors, then add the meat and sausage . Use the edge of a spoon to crumble it .
Add a sliced leek , stir and deglaze with soy sauce. Cook for about ten minutes, stirring often, until the meat is well browned. Then, remove the garlic and set aside in a bowl .
Gently detach the leaves from the cabbage , removing any outer ones if damaged. You'll need 10. Blanch a few at a time cooking them for 4-5 minutes. Drain them gently with tongs and remove excess water, being careful not to break the leaves; you can pat them dry with a paper towel.
Lay a cabbage leaf on a cutting board and place the filling at the bottom . Fold the side edges and roll it up .
In this way, you'll have your first cabbage roll . Continue like this for all the others and gradually arrange them in a baking dish. Season with a pinch of salt, grated ginger , and a drizzle of oil. Bake at 375°F for 20 minutes in static mode.
The cabbage rolls can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
If you prefer, you can add cheese cubes inside the rolls.
