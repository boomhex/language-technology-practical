instructions:
To make the savory red onion clafoutis, first clean and slice the onions into 1/8-inch thick slices (1-2): you will need about 9 oz of sliced onions. Move on to preparing the batter: pour the eggs into a large bowl and add the cream
and the milk and mix everything together with a whisk . Add the olive oil
and stir again to incorporate it into the mixture . At this point, also add the flour and the grated Grana Padano PDO cheese ,
salt , pepper, and mix with the whisk until you get a smooth and homogeneous consistency. Line a 9-inch baking dish with parchment paper and pour the mixture inside .
Lay the onion slices on the mixture , distributing them evenly over the entire surface , then bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 40-50 minutes until golden brown . Your savory clafoutis is ready to be enjoyed!
The red onion clafoutis can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, covered with plastic wrap. If desired, you can freeze it, ensuring to heat it in the oven before serving.
You can make many variations of the savory clafoutis using different seasonal vegetables or combinations: for example, cherry tomatoes and zucchini flowers, or zucchini, peppers, and eggplant… in this case, sauté them in a pan and let them cool before adding them to the batter.
