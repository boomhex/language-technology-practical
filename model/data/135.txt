instructions:
To prepare savory baked peppers, first cut off the pepper stems, then remove the seeds and inner filaments . Cut them first into strips, then into pieces of about 1.2x1.2 inches and transfer them into a bowl.
Chop with a knife capers, black olives, and sun-dried tomatoes . Slice the bread and then cut it into cubes of about 0.8 inches .
Season the peppers with oil and salt . Add the bread to the bowl .
Add the chopped capers, olives, and sun-dried tomatoes . Season with dried oregano and mix .
Arrange everything on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a static oven at 400°F for 10 minutes on the lowest rack of the oven, then move the baking sheet to the middle rack and continue baking for another 10 minutes . Your savory baked peppers are ready to be served .
Savory baked peppers can be stored in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for 2-3 days.
If you want to add an even more rustic note, you can add oil-packed anchovies or bacon cubes. For a vegetarian version, you can use feta, mozzarella, or smoked scamorza at the end of cooking, so they melt slightly and make the dish even more delicious.
