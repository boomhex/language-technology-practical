instructions:
To prepare the milk hot chocolate, start with the caramel: in a heavy-bottomed saucepan, pour the sugar and the water (2-3),
then bring to a boil over medium heat without stirring . When the mixture takes on an amber color, not too dark, remove the saucepan from the heat (or turn off the heat) and slowly pour the fresh liquid cream, little by little , stirring with a whisk. Be careful to add the cream gradually as indicated, paying attention to the steam and bubbles that will form . Set aside a couple of tablespoons of toffee sauce for decoration.
Chop the milk chocolate . Return the saucepan with the remaining toffee sauce to medium heat and add the milk ,
stirring continuously with a whisk , then also add the cornstarch . Bring to a boil and the mixture will thicken in a few moments. Then turn off the heat and add the chopped chocolate .
Stir again , add a pinch of salt , and your caramel hot chocolate is ready .
Whip the cream with beaters (16-17) and place it in a piping bag. Pour the chocolate into a cup
and garnish with whipped cream (19-20) and a tablespoon of toffee sauce set aside earlier . Your caramel toffee hot chocolate is ready to be served!
It is recommended to consume it once ready.
You can crumble some amaretti cookies on top of the cream or use hazelnut crumbs for garnish.
