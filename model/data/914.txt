instructions:
To make the donuts, first slightly heat the milk you will use to prepare the dough. Meanwhile, pour the all-purpose flour and bread flour into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a hook , along with the sugar and crumbled fresh yeast .
Start the stand mixer at moderate speed and gradually pour in the warm milk . Add the eggs one at a time and flavor with vanilla extract .
Finally, add the salt and continue to mix until the dough detaches from the sides of the bowl. At this point, you can add the softened butter, one piece at a time, ensuring that the previous piece is well absorbed before adding another ; this will take about 15-20 minutes. You should obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough .
Detach the dough from the hook with slightly damp hands, then use a scraper to turn it onto the work surface . Dust with a little flour and shape the dough into a sphere, using the scraper to handle it more easily . Transfer it to a large, previously buttered bowl, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rest for 2 hours in the oven with the light on.
After the rising time , transfer the dough back onto the lightly floured work surface and roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 0.4 inches , then cut circles using an 8 cm (about 3 inches) cookie cutter .
Create the donut holes using a smaller cookie cutter, 3 cm (about 1 inch) in diameter . Place the donuts on squares of parchment paper about 4 inches on a side placed on a tray ; transfer the dough scraps onto a tray lined with parchment paper as well . Cover the trays with a dish towel and let them rise for 40 minutes away from drafts.
Heat the seed oil in a saucepan to 350°F and fry a few donuts at a time, using the parchment paper square to immerse them without losing their shape . Turn them on both sides with a slotted spoon until they are evenly golden, about 3 minutes , then drain on paper towels .
Also, fry the scraps to make the famous donut holes . While the donuts cool slightly , you can prepare the glaze.
Pour the powdered sugar into a bowl with the melted butter , then mix with a hand whisk, adding just enough warm water to reach the desired consistency .
Divide the glaze into 3 bowls . Leave the first bowl plain. In the second, add the melted chocolate, which you have previously melted in a double boiler or microwave , and mix to combine .
Color the third bowl with food coloring and mix to achieve a uniform tone . Now you are ready to glaze your donuts by dipping one side into the glaze to coat it evenly .
Place the glazed donuts on a tray and decorate with sprinkles and candies as desired . Your donuts are ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the donuts immediately.
Enjoy the donut holes dusted with granulated sugar! You can substitute vanilla extract with the seeds of one pod. If you prefer to avoid frying, try our recipe for baked soft donuts!
