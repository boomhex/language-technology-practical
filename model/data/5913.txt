Guests coming over and still no ideas for starters? These easy to make ham pastry will come to your rescue: as they bake in the oven you can tend to all the other dishes for the evening ahead! As always puff pastry comes to our rescue, making sure we can whip up delicious bites filled with the best loved pairing ever, in no time at all: ham and cheese. Golden and crumbly, these bites will win everyone over right from the first bite!
To prepare ham pastries , cut the Asiago cheese into pieces , place them in the mixer and blend .
Cut the puff pastry roll into 8 rectangles of equal size . Take one rectangle and top the shorter side with the cheese and ham .
Now cut incisions into the untopped side . Fold like a book and seal the edges .
Press down along the edges with the prongs of a fork to create a decorative pattern and seal each bite . Place the bites on a tray lined with parchment paper and brush the surface with the egg yolk .
Sprinkle the sesame seeds over the surface and bake in a static oven preheated to 390°F (200°C) for 20 minutes, or until golden. Remove the ham pastries from the oven , leave to cool and serve warm.
Ham pastries can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days and can be heated up just before serving. They can be frozen both baked and unbaked.
They can be brushed with milk instead of egg. They can be decorated with poppy seeds or any other seeds you prefer. Asiago cheese can be replaced with Emmental, fontina or caciocavallo cheese.
