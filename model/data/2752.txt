Served in clear glasses, it shows off that bright, vivid green color. And the monster faces? Oh man, think olive slices for eyes or strips of pepper for a mouth. Really, the best part might be the black Venere rice on top—it looks like Frankenstein’s famous hair and gives the whole thing a super playful vibe.

To prepare the Frankenstein soup, place the cleaned celery and carrot, cut into fairly large pieces, in a pot and add water and a pinch of salt ; bring to a boil and in the meantime clean the broccoli, remove the florets from the central stem, and place them in a bowl . Wash the spinach, remove the toughest part of the stem , and set them aside.
When the water reaches a boil, add the broccoli , cook for about 5 minutes, then add the spinach and finally the peas .
Cook over medium heat for at least 20 minutes or until the vegetables are soft; if the cooking water dries out too much, add a ladle of vegetable broth . Once cooked, remove the pieces of carrot and celery and blend the vegetables with an immersion blender
until you obtain a smooth cream, a sort of puree . Separately, in a high-sided pot, heat some salted water , and once it reaches a boil, add the black rice and cook for about 20 minutes or the time indicated on the package.
Once cooked, drain the black rice and season it with a drizzle of olive oil . Everything is ready to assemble the soup: take wide glasses with a capacity of about 6.5 oz and draw the key features of Frankenstein's face with a black marker: slightly arched eyebrows, eyes, and mouth ;
then portion the soup into the glasses and garnish the surface with a couple of tablespoons of black rice : they will be Frankenstein's hair. Your Frankenstein soup is ready to amaze your children !
Store the Frankenstein soup in the refrigerator for a couple of days covered with plastic wrap. You can freeze the soup separately and then assemble the glasses with the rice as needed.
You can make the puree with other vegetables like chard or artichokes, as long as they are green like Frankenstein's face!
