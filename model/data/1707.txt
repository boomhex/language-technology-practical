instructions:
To make the soft strawberry cookies, first wash and dry the strawberries, then remove the hull and cut them into small cubes . In a bowl, place the soft butter cut into pieces, and the sugar
and the salt . Beat the mixture with electric whisks for a couple of minutes , then add the egg ,
the seeds from the vanilla pod , and the milk , blend the mixture with the whisks and then add the flour and baking powder sifted through a sieve .
Mix to incorporate the dry ingredients and then add the diced strawberries to the batter , distribute evenly using a spatula, then transfer the batter into a disposable piping bag without a nozzle .
The piping bag will help you distribute the batter evenly . Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, then pipe out mounds of batter, spacing them apart (14-15). With our measurements, you'll get about 30 cookies (you can split 12 cookies into two batches and make the last batch with 8).
Sprinkle the surface of the cookies with powdered sugar (16-17) and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 20 minutes on the middle shelf. Remove the strawberry cookies from the oven when they are still light and soft . Let cool and then enjoy your soft strawberry cookies.
They keep for 3-4 days in an airtight container or well-sealed bag. Allow to cool completely before sealing them in boxes or bags, or the moisture from the strawberries could compromise proper storage.
To make the surface of the cookie even crunchier, you can replace the powdered sugar with brown sugar.
