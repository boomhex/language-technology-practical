To prepare the polenta and porcini mushroom terrines, start by making the polenta. In a large pot, pour the water, add the coarse salt , a drizzle of oil, and bring it to a boil. Then gradually pour in the polenta flour while stirring initially with a whisk to obtain a lump-free mixture .
Continue by stirring the polenta with a spatula or a wooden spoon to mix it well. When the polenta is ready, pour it onto a tray lined with parchment paper , and level the surface . You need to achieve a thickness of about 0.4 inches, then let it rest at room temperature.
Meanwhile, focus on How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms : using a small knife, remove the excess soil from the stem and clean the entire mushroom with a slightly damp cloth . At this point, slice the porcini mushrooms, not too thinly .
In a pan, place the oil and garlic, and let it brown, then add the mushrooms and let them stew for about 8-10 minutes; then salt, pepper, remove the garlic and add the thyme leaves . Once the polenta is cold, cut the scamorza cheese into cubes and start composing the terrines.
Grease the bottom of the terrine and using a pastry cutter, cut out 4 discs of 2.75 inches and 4 of 3.15 inches. Assemble the terrines by placing the smaller disc at the bottom ,
then the porcini mushrooms , the scamorza cheese cubes , and finally the larger polenta disc .
Finish the terrines with the remaining scamorza cheese and gratinate for about 10 minutes in a static oven at 392°F (if using a convection oven, bake for about 6 minutes at 356°F). Remove from the oven and serve the polenta and porcini mushroom terrines while hot.
We recommend consuming the gratinated polenta and porcini mushroom terrines as soon as they are ready, but if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator, closed in an airtight container, for up to a couple of days. Alternatively, you can freeze them.
To add a special touch to the recipe, we used more sought-after mushrooms like porcini, otherwise, other types of mushrooms like champignons or honey mushrooms will work just fine. For cheese lovers, suggest a variation with mild gorgonzola or Roquefort instead of the mushrooms! All these are vegetarian dishes, but if you want, you can also add meat, sausage, or ham to the preparation.
