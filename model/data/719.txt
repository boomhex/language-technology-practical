instructions:
To prepare the grilled primosale with vegetables, first wash all the vegetables well. Take the potatoes and without peeling them, cut them into wedges . Move on to the carrots: peel them and cut them in half . Then make slices and finally sticks .
Now take care of the Brussels sprouts, remove the outer leaves and the lower part , cut them in half and set them aside. Take the Romanesco broccoli and separate the florets , if they are very large, cut them in half .
Now also cut the onions into wedges . Put a pot full of water on the stove that will be used to boil the vegetables. When it's hot, pour a generous amount of oil into another pan and add the potatoes . Sauté them for about 5 minutes. In the meantime, immerse the Romanesco broccoli in the boiling water.
Blanch them for 3-4 minutes . Meanwhile, also check the potatoes to prevent them from burning . Using a slotted spoon, remove the Romanesco broccoli and transfer them to the potatoes .
In the same cooking water, add the Brussels sprouts , cook them for 2-3 minutes and as before, drain them with the slotted spoon . Transfer them to the pan with the potatoes .
Add the onions , the carrots , and sauté everything .
Transfer to a baking tray lined with parchment paper . Season with salt , pepper, oil, and add the rosemary . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 25-30 minutes.
When there are only a few minutes left, start preparing the primosale. Place a pan on the stove and let it heat up. Brush the primosale with oil , on both sides . Place the cheese in the hot pan and cook for 2-3 minutes over medium heat .
When it is slightly golden, flip it and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Now also remove the vegetables from the oven . Serve the primosale with the seasonal vegetables, adding a pinch of black pepper and a drizzle of oil .
We recommend consuming the primosale immediately. The vegetables can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a couple of days.
Use other vegetables, based on the season and according to your preferences!
