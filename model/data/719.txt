Air fryer zeppole bring a fresh twist to a classic treat that pops up every March in Campania, especially for Father’s Day . These Italian doughnuts air fryer style are light and just a bit crispy, thanks to the hot air swirling in the basket. Really, you won’t miss the oil from the traditional fried version at all. And the dough? Based on the same choux pastry as the original zeppole di San Giuseppe , so you still get that tender bite everyone loves—with way, way less mess.
The filling is vanilla pastry cream topped with a candied amarena cherry. It's that sweet and slightly tangy flavor you’d find in Neapolitan bakeries. Some folks switch it up with mascarpone cream and coffee or even try gluten-free versions to fit everyone’s needs. And here's the thing: these air fryer dessert recipes keep it simple, and the results are really really tasty.
It’s amazing how the air fryer makes these Italian pastries so easy, turning what used to be a special-occasion treat into something you can whip up for a weekend snack or after-dinner sweet fix. In Naples, they say it’s all about getting that golden shell that holds up to whatever cream you put inside. And look, the air fryer does a pretty good job at that. You can get creative—try adding a dusting of powdered sugar or mixing flavors with chocolate or pistachio creams.
These air fryer zeppole come out moist in the middle and perfect for sharing with friends or family. With so many ways to fill and top them, this is one of those baking recipes that can fit any mood or crowd. Whether you go classic with cream and cherries or branch out with your own ideas—making zeppole in the air fryer brings a little taste of Naples home in a lighter, easier way, allowing you to enjoy the rich traditions of Campania without all the fuss.

To prepare zeppole in an air fryer, start with the choux pastry. In a pot, pour the water , butter , a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar. Turn on the heat and start heating the mixture.
As soon as it reaches a boil and the butter is completely melted, add the flour by sprinkling it and mix with a wooden spoon . Cook until the dough detaches from the sides of the pot and a whitish film forms at the bottom .
Then pour the mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer equipped with a flat beater and start it at low speed. Add the eggs one at a time , waiting for the first to be well absorbed before adding more. You should obtain a smooth and creamy mixture . Transfer it to a piping bag with a 0.5-inch star nozzle.
Take a sheet of parchment paper and draw circles of 2.5 inches; you can use a cookie cutter to trace its perimeter with a pencil. Space the circles well apart . Turn the paper over and form the zeppole by making two rounds of choux pastry, one on top of the other, for each . Using a knife or scissors, cut the parchment paper around the zeppole , so that each zeppola is on a square of paper and can be lifted easily.
Preheat the air fryer to 356°F (we used a fryer with a 6-quart capacity), insert two zeppole inside and cook for 13 minutes, then increase the temperature to 392°F and continue cooking for another 12 minutes. Remove the zeppole when they are nicely golden , transfer them to a rack to cool and meanwhile cook the others. In the meantime, start preparing the custard. In a saucepan, pour milk, cream, the seeds of the vanilla pod and the emptied pod .
Pour the egg yolks into a bowl, add the sugar and mix with a whisk. Also add the cornstarch and mix again until you obtain a homogeneous mixture .
As soon as the milk and cream mixture reaches a boil, remove the vanilla pod and pour part of it into the yolk mixture ; mix to temper it .
Pour everything back into the saucepan and mix with a whisk until the cream thickens and starts to boil.
Transfer the obtained cream to a bowl , cover with contact plastic wrap and let it cool completely first at room temperature and then in the refrigerator . Once cold, transfer the cream to a piping bag with a 0.5-inch star nozzle. Take the air fryer-cooked zeppole and cut them in half, like a sandwich .
Fill abundantly with cream and close with the top part . Dust with powdered sugar .
Add a dollop of cream on top as well and decorate with a syruped cherry . The first zeppola is ready , proceed the same way for all the others and keep in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
You can store the filled zeppole for up to 2 days.
You can store the unfilled zeppole for 3-4 days in an airtight container, or freeze them.
You can store the cream in the refrigerator for 3 days.
Once cold, the custard may appear compact. Before transferring it to the piping bag, work it well with a whisk. If you prefer, you can flavor the cream with lemon or orange zest. For the number of zeppole to bake, adjust according to the size of your basket; it's important they are well spaced.
