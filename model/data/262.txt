instructions:
To prepare the cod in the air fryer, cut the fish fillets into smaller pieces, about 2.5 inches . Place the fish pieces in a baking dish and season them with olive oil , massaging them well to coat them evenly .
Chop the parsley and add it to the breadcrumbs , season the breading with salt .
Add pepper , then season with a drizzle of olive oil and white wine .
Mix the breading well and pour half of it over the cod pieces , mix well to make the breadcrumbs adhere .
Wash and trim the zucchini , then cut them into slices about 1/4 inch thick . Place them in a bowl and season with olive oil .
Pour the remaining flavored breading over the top and mix to make it adhere well to the zucchini . Now place the fish pieces in the air fryer basket (we used a fryer with a capacity of 6 liters). Adjust based on the size of your fryer, the fish should not overlap; if the fryer is not large enough, it may be necessary to cook in batches.
Pour the breaded zucchini slices between the empty spaces , trying not to overlap them too much. Cook for 15 minutes at 356°F, until golden . The air fryer cod is ready to be enjoyed with the crunchy zucchini .
After cooking, store the cod in the air fryer with the zucchini in the refrigerator, inside an airtight container, for a maximum of 1-2 days. To keep it crispy, reheat in the air fryer at 356°F for 3-4 minutes before serving. Avoid using the microwave, which would make it soft.
You can freeze the cooked cod if you used fresh fish, but it will lose some crispiness. We do not recommend freezing the zucchini.
For a more aromatic breading, you can add lemon zest and chopped rosemary to the breadcrumbs.
