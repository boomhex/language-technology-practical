instructions:
To prepare the zucchini salad with mint and basil, start by washing the zucchini thoroughly under running water . Dry them with a cloth and place them on a cutting board, then trim off the two ends . Next, cut the zucchini in half .
Cut it in half again lengthwise and begin to slice it into pieces about 3/4 inch wide . Now take a large pot, fill it with water, and bring to a boil. Then add the sliced zucchini to the boiling water .
Add a tablespoon of coarse salt and let cook for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, drain the zucchini with a colander and let them cool . Then transfer them to a baking dish and drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil .
Salt and pepper the zucchini to taste (10-11) and add a peeled clove of garlic .
Then add the chopped mint leaves and basil leaves . Mix everything with a fork or a spoon, and your zucchini salad with mint and basil is ready to be served and enjoyed either warm or cold. If not serving immediately, keep it in the fridge until it's time to enjoy!
You can store the zucchini salad with mint and basil in the refrigerator, well covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container, for up to 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
My stomach, get ready: light and tasty, zucchini salad can be made even more appetizing with a few additions. For example, grated lemon zest, chopped toasted almonds, or a splash of balsamic vinegar! How do you like it?
