Discover the delightful combination of flavors in this exquisite fig and prosciutto pizza recipe, a traditional Italian dish hailing from Rome. This unique recipe combines the simplicity of white pizza with the delightful sweetness of figs and the savory essence of raw ham.
Unlike traditional pizzas, this recipe does not include tomato puree. Instead, it features a perfect blend of fresh mozzarella, which adds moisture and enhances the flavors. While we used fresh mozzarella in this preparation, other types of cheese can also be used, complementing the delicate taste of figs and raw ham.
Also known as "Pizza Settembrina," this pizza gets its name from the fig harvesting season in Italy, where the fruits reach their peak ripeness in September. Capturing the essence of late summer, this pizza brings together all the flavors of the season. The raw ham should be subtly sweet and not heavily seasoned, allowing the delicate and sweet taste of the figs to shine.
Fig and prosciutto pizza recipe is a simple and authentic example of Roman cuisine, which has gained popularity as a street food throughout the streets of the Italian capital during late summer: a soft white pizza crust topped with excellent quality raw ham and fresh figs sliced into wedges creates a heavenly combination of flavors!
If you love pizza you can't miss these recipes:
In a cup, mix 1/4 cup warm water (taking it out of the total ingredients) with the crumbled yeast and sugar and let sit for a few minutes.
In the meantime, sift the flour onto a work surface, add the salt and make a hole in the centre.
Start pouring the water and yeast mixture into the center of the flour, stirring with a spoon. Continue bringing the flour to the center gradually from the sides and keep mixing.
Add the remaining water (3/4 cup) and the oil as well. Keep adding flour and mixing until everything is incorporated.
Now knead the dough with your hands until you achieve a smooth and elastic consistency. Form a ball and let it rest in a bowl covered with a tea towel until the dough has doubled in size (about 1.5 - 2 hours).
Transfer the dough onto a floured surface, divide it into 2 parts (to obtain 2 medium pizzas), and roll out each piece of dough with a rolling pin into circles, about 0.5 cm thick. Place them on a baking sheet greased with olive oil.
Preheat the oven to 250°C / 480°F, or if not available, your oven's maximum temperature.
When the pizza bases have risen, drizzle them with extra virgin olive oil.
Bake for about 8-10 minutes on the bottom of the oven until pizza is golden around the edges.
Remove the pizza bases from the oven, add mozzarella cheese cut into small pieces, place them back in the oven on the middle rack, and finish cooking for another 5-6 minutes.
Take the white pizzas out of the oven and let them cool for 5 minutes.
Top them with raw ham and sliced figs. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, add a few basil leaves and a few drops of balsamic vinegar.
The fig and prosciutto pizza is ready!
To store leftover pizza in the refrigerator, put it in an airtight container or wrap it in a plastic bag to freeze. Pizza leftovers can last up to 3 days.
To reheat pizza the easiest way is to heat it in the oven at 375°F for 5-7 minutes. Alternatively you can reheat in the microwave, just place the pizza on a plate and cook it on full power for 30 seconds.
PIZZA BASE: You can refer to our pizza dough recipe . For a quickfig and prosciutto pizza recipe, you can use a pre-cooked pizza base or ready-made pizza dough. The dough is typically prepared with Italian type '00' flour, but if you're using a different type of flour, make sure it is strong and gluten-rich.
FIGS: You can use both green or black figs, with the black variety being sweeter. When purchasing figs, ensure they are firm and ripe.
MOZZARELLA: To prepare the fig and prosciutto pizza recipe, you can use mozzarella, but other cheeses like goat cheese or sweet scamorza also work well. For a crispier pizza, we recommend chopping the mozzarella and allowing any excess liquid to drain.
BALSAMIC VINEGAR: The combination of sweet and savory flavors always works well. Consider adding a few drops of balsamic vinegar or alternatively, drizzle some honey on top for added richness.
