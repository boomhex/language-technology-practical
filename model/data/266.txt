instructions:
To prepare mushrooms in oil, start by cleaning the champignon mushrooms: remove the base of the stem and gently clean the surface with a cloth or damp napkin (if the mushrooms are very dirty, you can opt for a quick rinse in cold water for a few seconds). Cut them in half .
Set the mushrooms aside . Clean and finely chop the garlic , and slice the fresh chili pepper into rings .
In a saucepan, heat the vinegar and water ; as soon as it nears boiling, immerse the mushrooms and add salt.
When the solution starts boiling again , add the rosemary, chili pepper , and chopped garlic .
Also add the bay leaves and stir. Wait 1 minute, then let it cool slightly and drain the mushrooms with a skimmer , transferring them to a colander .
Dry everything on a clean cloth , patting them well. Then take a perfectly clean 17 oz glass jar with a new lid. Fill it with the mushrooms, pressing them lightly . Then fill with extra virgin olive oil to the top in two steps, waiting for the oil to distribute throughout the jar .
Seal with the lid and submerge in a pot with cold water. Turn on the heat and bring to a boil for about 60 minutes. After this time, let the jars cool in the water itself. To be sure the 'vacuum sealing' operation is successful, just check that the lid doesn’t click when pressed with fingers.
Store your mushrooms in oil in a cool place away from light.
Since it's a homemade preparation, we recommend consuming the mushrooms within 6 months. If you notice signs of alteration, such as air bubbles rising from the bottom to the lid or the oil becoming cloudy, the preserve might not be safe to consume. In case of doubt, it is essential not to taste or consume the product.
For a milder alternative to garlic and chili, you can use thyme or marjoram for an intense yet balanced aroma. If using other types of mushrooms, the blanching time in water and vinegar is almost always the same; it always depends on the size and type of mushrooms.
Homemade preparation of preserves and jams can pose health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the necessary conditions and measures to ensure food safety and suitability, which industrial procedures can ensure to prevent dangerous contamination. It is therefore important to strictly follow food safety guidelines to reduce risks, but one must always keep in mind that one can never achieve the same food safety as professionally produced preserves and jams. For correct preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
