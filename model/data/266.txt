Devil-style chicken with potatoes is one of those dishes that instantly transports you to a Southern Italian family gathering. The golden aroma? It's amazing. The deviled chicken really gets its kick from a zesty marinade of vinegar, honey, smoked paprika, garlic, chili pepper, and fresh rosemary. I mean, the chicken ends up so tender inside. But that skin? Super crispy, cooked slow and steady. In Calabria and Campania, it's a staple for when family and friends come together—usually on a Sunday or for some celebration.
And look, the flavors are bold but balanced, with a tangy sweetness and just enough heat to wake up your taste buds. Really good stuff. Paired with baked chicken with potatoes , it captures comfort food but with that unique Southern Italian twist. Makes it different. Folks in Italy swear by these potatoes. They're roasted to get crispy outside while staying moist inside, soaking up all those flavorful juices from the chicken. Not your average spicy chicken recipe —it is got that home-cooked feel.
And here's the thing, you won’t find boring sides here. Those potatoes really hold their own. For sure. Whether it’s a casual dinner or you’re trying to impress guests, a classic sheet pan dinner like this is super satisfying. Pretty much. The colors and smells fill the kitchen, making everyone hungry before it even hits the table. People might argue about the best way to cook chicken in Italy—no question—but everyone agrees this combination of crispy skin, soft potatoes, and a marinade that really really packs a punch is special.
It's a meal that feels both rustic and a bit festive. Perfect for sharing and making memories over a long, relaxed meal. And, here's the deal, it's a dish that's easy to prepare yet gives you a rich taste of Southern Italian tradition, capturing the core of warmth and hospitality. Can't go wrong.

To prepare the deviled chicken with potatoes, first cut it in half lengthwise, through the breast side , open it like a book , and press it down well with your hands .
In a baking dish, pour the red wine vinegar , sweet paprika , and honey .
Add the salt , pepper, lemon juice , and chopped rosemary .
Add the chili pepper and garlic . Mix everything until obtaining a homogeneous marinade. Place the chicken inside the baking dish .
Brush the marinade on both sides, making sure to cover the entire surface evenly . Let marinate in the refrigerator for at least an hour, or longer if possible, to allow the flavors to penetrate. After this time, peel and cut the potatoes first in half and then into wedges .
Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water for about 15 minutes, until they are cooked outside but still firm inside . In the meantime, pour oil and clarified butter into a baking sheet and place it in a preheated oven at 392°F (200°C) for 8 minutes.
At this point, carefully drain the potatoes and let them dry on a rack . Transfer the potatoes to the hot baking sheet , mix them to coat evenly, and bake in a fan oven at 392°F (200°C) for 45 minutes, stirring every 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, also cook the chicken: heat a large pan over medium heat with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the whole garlic and fresh chili pepper .
Take the marinated chicken and place it in the hot pan with the skin side down . Place a weight (such as another pan or a heavy lid) to press it down during cooking .
Cook over medium heat for about 30 minutes, turning the chicken halfway through cooking and always covering it with a weight . When the potatoes are well-browned, remove them from the oven and season with salt .
Add the chopped parsley and mix. As soon as the deviled chicken is cooked , serve it with the roasted potatoes and drizzle with the cooking juices !
You can store the cooked deviled chicken in the refrigerator for 1-2 days at most, in an airtight container.
Draining the potatoes is very important to achieve a golden crust. If you prefer, you can skip the boiling step and cook the potatoes directly in the oven for about 40 minutes at 392°F (200°C).
