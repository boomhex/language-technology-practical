To prepare the mini baked cassatas, start with the shortcrust pastry: in the bowl of your stand mixer with the paddle attachment, add the sugar, butter cut into cubes (removed from the fridge 5 minutes earlier) , and a pinch of salt . Mix briefly to combine .
Then add the egg yolks and lemon zest . Turn on the mixer to combine. Finally, add the flour .
Knead until you get a compact and homogeneous mixture . Form a flat dough disc , wrap it in cling film and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours.
Now focus on the filling: drain the ricotta well, then sieve it into a bowl . Add the sugar and grated orange zest .
Add the dark chocolate chips and continue mixing until a uniform cream is obtained . Place the mixture in the fridge until it's time to use it. Meanwhile, coarsely crumble the dry biscuits .
Take out the shortcrust pastry from the refrigerator, take 2/3 , and roll out the pastry to a thickness of about 1/8 inch . Cut out 12 disks using a pastry cutter approximately 4.7 inches in diameter .
Butter and flour 12 molds with a diameter of 3.15 inches and line them with the pastry disks . Keep the scraps and a bit of pastry in the refrigerator to make the lids. Pour half of the crumbled biscuits on the bottom . Take the filling and transfer it into a piping bag without a nozzle, then squeeze it inside the baskets almost to the edge and level it well with a spatula.
Now add the remaining crumbled biscuits on top of the filling . Roll out the leftover pastry to the same thickness of about 1/8 inch . Moisten the edges of the pastries with a little water using a kitchen brush .
Place the pastry disks on top and seal the edges well by pressing lightly . Before baking, or after about 10 minutes of cooking, prick the surface with a toothpick to allow steam to escape. Bake the mini cassatas in a preheated static oven at 350-355°F for about 35-40 minutes, placing them on the bottom shelf .
Once baked , let them cool completely inside the mold. Finally, flip the pastries onto a serving tray, dust them with powdered sugar , and if you have a pie grid, use it as a stencil to create an elegant decoration. At this point, your mini baked cassatas are ready to be served .
The mini baked cassatas can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Before serving them, remember to let them sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes to enjoy them at their best.
Instead of crumbled biscuits, you can use crumbled sponge cake scraps to absorb the moisture of the filling. The original recipe calls for sheep ricotta, but you can substitute it with cow ricotta in the same quantities. If you like, you can add a pinch of cinnamon to the filling.
