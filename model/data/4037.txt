To prepare the lemon turkey meatballs, start by soaking the stale bread in milk in a bowl, allowing it to soften for a few minutes . Meanwhile, in another large bowl, add the ground turkey and season it with a grind of black pepper and a pinch of salt .
Incorporate a whole egg . Also add the grated Parmesan cheese , then incorporate the soaked and well-squeezed bread with your hands .
Season with some fresh thyme leaves and grate the zest of one lemon directly into the bowl . At this point, mix all the ingredients with your hands until you obtain a homogeneous, soft but compact mixture .
Take a portion of the mixture and form walnut-sized meatballs, rolling them between your palms , then place them all on a plate . Roll them in flour, coating well on all sides .
In a large pan, heat a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil with a crushed clove of garlic and a few sprigs of thyme . Once hot, place the meatballs in the pan and let them brown over medium-high heat, turning them occasionally until golden on all sides .
Once well-sealed and colored , deglaze with freshly squeezed lemon juice . Also pour a glass of white wine or, if you prefer, broth or water to aid cooking.
Cover the pan with a lid and cook the meatballs on low heat for about 15–20 minutes until tender and well-cooked inside. Adjust with salt and freshly ground black pepper at the end of cooking.
When the meatballs are ready, plate them in a serving bowl or dish, pouring over their aromatic cooking juice . Grate a final generous sprinkle of lemon zest and serve hot, completing with a few fresh thyme leaves to taste .
Lemon turkey meatballs can be stored for a day in the refrigerator in an airtight container. Alternatively, you can freeze them.
If during cooking the sauce seems too liquid, you can add a teaspoon of flour or cornstarch dissolved in a little cold water: you'll get a creamier and more enveloping sauce, perfect for drizzling over the meatballs when serving.
