Whole wheat mezze penne rigate with roasted tomato pesto, ricotta cheese , and spinach powder is, I gotta say, a pasta dish with a fun twist on traditional Italian flavors. And look, hailing from Liguria, this recipe combines classic ideas with fresh summer vibes, pretty much. The whole wheat penne pasta gives a rustic, hearty bite that pairs beautifully with the creamy, smooth sauce made from roasted cherry tomatoes and ricotta. These tomatoes? They're cooked confit-style, slow-roasted with thyme until they turn sweet and slightly jammy. Seriously good. You end up with a roasted tomato pesto that's both tangy and rich. When mixed with ricotta, it forms a sauce that coats each piece of pasta and feels creamy without being heavy.
