instructions:
To prepare the paccheri with potatoes and mussels, first place the peeled garlic clove and parsley stems in a large pot. Add a drizzle of oil, heat, and add the mussels . Cover with a lid and cook over high heat .
When the mussels are completely open, turn off the heat . Strain them with a colander to separate the liquid from the fruits . Place the saffron in a small bowl, add a ladle of mussel cooking water , and mix. Set aside.
Shell most of the mussels and collect them in another small bowl. Keep the cooking liquid that will be used later . Peel the potato .
Cut it into cubes about 0.4 inches in size . Transfer the potatoes to a hot pan with a drizzle of oil and cook until tender and well browned . Then pour in the mussel liquid and let it flavor for a couple of minutes. The potatoes should still be slightly brothy.
Meanwhile, chop the parsley leaves and cook the paccheri in plenty of salted boiling water to taste . Transfer the potatoes to a tall container .
Blend with an immersion blender and transfer the potato cream to the same pan. Add the al dente paccheri .
Also add the saffron liquid , the shelled mussels , and the chopped parsley .
Mix well . Transfer the pasta to the plates , decorate with the mussels in the shell , and serve hot!
We recommend serving the pasta immediately. Alternatively, it can be stored for a maximum of one day.
Besides mussels, you can also use clams if you prefer.
You can enhance this pasta with fresh chili pepper.
