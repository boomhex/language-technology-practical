If you're on the hunt for a dish that just screams sophistication, fagottino di pasta fresca con tuorlo fondente is where it's at. This Northern Italian gem, often known as egg yolk ravioli or Italian egg yolk pasta , feels perfect for a fancy Sunday lunch. Really, it's a treat. Each delicate parcel is made from fresh egg pasta, lovingly wrapped around a creamy mix of ricotta, herbs, and grated cheese.
But you know what? The real magic is the whole egg yolk tucked inside. It's baked just enough to stay soft and ooze out when you cut into it. Seriously good stuff. It's a rich blend of velvety textures and flavors that makes you feel comforted and, honestly, a bit spoiled.
In Northern Italy, this dish is a must for festive meals—a true showstopper. And look, it tastes like it took hours, even if it didn’t. For those who love fresh pasta with egg yolk or have tried a homemade ravioli recipe , this is a step up.
The trick? Perfecting that golden, runny center. Keep that yolk gooey and warm inside the pasta. Often, it’s served with a sweet, cheesy fondue sauce drizzled over the top—brings it all together. And gives the dish an elegant touch.
Unlike your typical ricotta and spinach ravioli, fagottino di pasta fresca is pretty much an event. Every bite is a fusion of creamy filling and soft pasta, with that surprising egg yolk bursting in the middle. And the sauce? It's a playful touch. It’s not just about taste. Watching the yolk flow out is so, so playful and makes the whole plate feel special.
Whether you call it stuffed pasta with egg yolk , raviolo al uovo , or just a simple Italian marvel, this is the kind of meal to save for when you want something really really special. It's an experience that combines fine dining joy with home cooking warmth—making each forkful a little celebration of Italian culinary artistry. For sure.
To prepare the egg pasta bundle with molten yolk, start with the egg pasta dough: in a bowl (or on a pastry board) sift the flour and place the room temperature eggs in the center. Mix with a fork at first, then continue kneading with your hands . When the mixture is more homogeneous , transfer it to a work surface,
knead it and form a dough ball that you can wrap in plastic wrap . Place the egg pasta in a cool, dry place. In the meantime, focus on the filling: wash the herbs under running water, then break the larger ones
and sauté them in a pan with a drizzle of oil and a whole garlic clove . When they are cooked, remove the garlic and transfer them to a blender cup to blend them together with the ricotta (8-9).
Add the mix of grated cheeses, salt and pepper to taste, and sprinkle with a bit of grated nutmeg . Blend everything and transfer the obtained cream into a piping bag; you can keep it in the refrigerator until ready to use. After half an hour, you can roll out the egg pasta using a pasta machine to make a thin sheet, passing the pasta from the thickest to the thinnest setting .
Cut the obtained sheet into 15 squares of 5 inches per side with a fluted pastry cutter (13-14): in this way, you will obtain 8 bundles each composed of 2 squares. Prepare two pots: in one, bring salted water to a boil where you will cook the fresh pasta squares for a few moments (set aside the boiling water); in the other, pour cold water to immerse the cooked pasta for a moment to stop the cooking.
After these steps, drain the squares on an oiled tray . In the center of 8 squares, create a circle of herb and cheese filling, and then another circle along the perimeter of the first one ; in this way, you will have made a small nest that you will fill with the yolk .
Close the bundle by covering with another square of fresh pasta, arranged diagonally like a diamond . Before closing the bundles, cut 8 strips of leek lengthwise and blanch them for a few minutes in the water where you cooked the egg pasta squares : this step will soften the strips that will be used to seal the bundles. Close each bundle by taking the edges of the pasta and transfer it to the previously oiled muffin mold ;
tie each bundle with a leek strip and set them aside for a moment. At this point, dedicate yourself to preparing the fondue: take the Fontal cheese, remove the rind , and cut it into cubes .
Pour them into a blender cup and chop them finely . In a saucepan, heat the milk and when it is hot, turn off the heat and gradually add the chopped cheese , stirring with a whisk to melt it.
Adjust with salt and pepper and flavor the fondue with some grated nutmeg . When the fondue coats a wooden spoon, turn off the heat. At this point, broil the bundles at 482°F for 3 minutes, then pour the fondue as a mirror on the serving plates and place the fresh pasta bundle with molten yolk on top to serve hot.
You can store the cooked fresh egg pasta bundles for 1 day in the refrigerator. The egg pasta can be frozen, cut into squares, and after being dried. You can prepare the herb and cheese filling in advance and store it in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap.
For the molten center, use only very fresh eggs to prevent the yolk from breaking. If you prefer, you can replace the herbs with spinach!
