Coq au Vin —it's this classic dish from Burgundy, France that has these rich, rich flavors. And look, it's got such traditional roots. Imagine a tender chicken stew just soaking up that full-bodied red wine, with carrots, onions, and those aromatic herbs. Seriously good stuff. This French chicken stew is all about taking it slow, like super slow; you marinate that chicken for hours, maybe even overnight, so it really absorbs that deep wine flavor.
Plus, adding bacon—or pancetta if you’re feeling fancy—mushrooms, and a touch of garlic, gives it such an extra layer of taste, you know? The result? It’s super moist, rustic, and packed with all those comforting flavors you'd find in a traditional French recipe . Perfect for a leisurely meal worth sharing—pair it with a nice bottle of wine, and you're golden.
And here's the thing about chicken in red wine —it's how the ingredients blend over time that makes it unique. The sauce turns into this silky reddish-brown concoction, while the veggies and bacon give the chicken a rich and kind of sweet background. It's not just dinner; it's special—like, really special—for occasions or family gatherings.
The dish has some deep roots, historically speaking—stories trace back to ancient Gaul and even have connections to Julius Caesar. And look, whether you've heard of Julia Child’s Coq au Vin or you're just exploring classic French cuisine, this meal is all about comfort and tradition. It's so perfect with crusty bread to soak up that savory red wine sauce, making even a simple Sunday dinner feel like a celebration.
There's just something special about knowing people have been making this classic French dish for centuries—using local wine and fresh ingredients. It's a true testament to what rustic French comfort food is all about. Pretty much perfection.
To prepare coq au vin, take the chicken and cut it into pieces following the instructions you find here (how to cut the chicken). Cut the onion into wedges and the carrots into slices . Put the cut chicken into a large enough bowl, add the carrot, onion, and enough red wine to cover it entirely .
Add rosemary needles, previously cleaned and stripped parsley, thyme, and whole peppercorns . Cover well with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge for at least 12 hours. You can prepare it the night before and leave it in the fridge overnight. After the necessary time, strain everything, separating the marinade from the vegetables and chicken .
Heat a non-stick pan with olive oil and crush 2 garlic cloves into it . Add the chicken and brown it well over moderate heat on all sides for at least 6-7 minutes. When it's well browned, remove it from the non-stick pan and set it aside, keeping it warm.
In the pan, instead of the chicken, place the marinade vegetables and cook for 2 minutes . Then add the pearl onions and let them cook for another 3 minutes . Finally, add the flour and let the cooking base thicken.
At this point, transfer the chicken and vegetables to a larger pot, where it will cook over very low heat for about two and a half hours, barely simmering. Immediately deglaze with brandy and after a few minutes cover the coq with the marinade wine, adding a ladle at a time . Cover with a lid and let it cook.
While the coq au vin is cooking, cut the bacon into strips and, after cleaning them, slice the mushrooms (if there are very small mushrooms, you can leave them whole without cutting them). In a non-stick pan, brown the sliced bacon, and as soon as it releases its fat, add the mushrooms and sauté for about 6 minutes .
Deglaze the mushrooms and bacon with a couple of ladles of broth and adjust the salt . When they have dried out, combine the mushrooms and bacon with the coq au vin and let everything cook together for the last 15 minutes. Adjust the salt and pepper if necessary, and here is your coq au vin : serve it hot on a serving platter .
You can store the coq au vin in an airtight container.
If you like, you can buy the chicken already cut into pieces. If you have leftover coq au vin cooking base, you can strain it, blend it, and use it as a base for risotto or to season pasta or ravioli.
Coq au vin is the favorite dish of Commissioner Maigret, the famous literary character invented by George Simenon.
