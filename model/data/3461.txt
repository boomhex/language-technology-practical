instructions:
To prepare the rabbit stew, start by removing the excess fat from the rabbit, then extract the kidneys, heart, and liver and set them aside . Wash the rabbit, pat it dry with a kitchen towel, and cut it into pieces (or buy it pre-cut). Peel and chop the onion, place it in a pan with the oil , and let it wilt over low heat for at least 10 minutes without browning. Add a fine mixture of chili pepper, rosemary, sage, bay leaf, and garlic , and sauté for a couple of minutes,
then add the rabbit pieces and let them brown . Add the white wine and let it evaporate, then add the tomato , salt and pepper, and cover with a lid.
When needed, add some vegetable broth ; halfway through cooking, add the heart, kidneys, and liver cut in half . Once the rabbit is cooked, leave the pot uncovered until the cooking juices thicken, then adjust the seasoning with more salt if necessary and turn off the heat . Serve the rabbit accompanied by polenta, pilaf rice, or plenty of slices of rustic bread to soak up the delicious cooking sauce.
