instructions:
To prepare pan-fried John Dory, first place the fillets on a cutting board, without removing the skin, and salt them . Wash the cherry tomatoes well and cut them in half, or into quarters if they are too large . Take the olives and pit them .
Proceed with the parsley: chop it finely . Now crush the garlic, without peeling it, using the flat side of a knife blade . In a large pan, pour a drizzle of oil, add a clove of garlic , and let it brown.
Transfer the fish fillets into the pan, placing them skin-side down . Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, then deglaze with the white wine . Without turning the fillets, repeatedly pour the cooking juices over them to facilitate cooking .
Now add the cherry tomatoes , black olives , and a pinch of chili pepper .
Continue cooking for about 20 minutes. You will not need to turn the fillets, just continuously pour the cooking juices over them . As soon as the fillets turn white, they are cooked. Add the chopped parsley , adjust the salt if necessary, and serve them .
You can store the fillets in the refrigerator for up to one day. Alternatively, you can freeze them, only if you have used all fresh products.
If the cooking juices dry out too much, you can add a ladle of water during cooking.
If you prefer, you can also add capers.
