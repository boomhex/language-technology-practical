How do you use a pressure cooker?
It is important not to overfill the pressure cooker. Usually, a mark inside the pot indicates the level not to exceed: usually 2/3. For foods that increase in volume, like rice, it is recommended not to exceed half. Before starting cooking, make sure the lid is closed correctly and the valve is closed. As soon as the cooker reaches pressure, you can lower the heat, making the steam release from the valve as constant and "light" as possible. Keeping it on low will also save energy.
How do you open a pressure cooker?
Never open the lid while steam is coming out of the valve. After cooking, you must release all the steam by lifting or turning the valve, and as soon as the pot is no longer under pressure you can open the lid. Be careful of the steam jet during the "decompression" phase.
