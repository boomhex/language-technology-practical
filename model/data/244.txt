To make the duchess potatoes, boil the potatoes with their skins starting from cold water for about 30-40 minutes, until they are tender enough to be easily pierced with a fork . Peel the potatoes while still hot and pass them through a potato ricer .
Gather the mashed potatoes while still hot in a bowl and add the yolks , butter , and grated cheese .
Salt, pepper, and mix everything with a hand whisk until you get a homogeneous mixture . Transfer the mixture to a piping bag with a half-inch star tip .
Squeeze out tufts onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated convection oven at 350°F for 15-20 minutes, until golden . Serve your duchess potatoes immediately !
Duchess potatoes can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days in an airtight container.
You can freeze them after baking and bake them directly from frozen for 3-4 minutes.
It's preferable to use a potato ricer instead of a potato masher to achieve a finer consistency. To mix the ingredients, you can use a stand mixer with a whisk attachment!
If you don't have a convection mode, you can bake in a preheated conventional oven at 370°F.
To shorten the cooking time, you can cook the Potatoes in Pressure Cooker !
