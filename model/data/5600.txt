instructions:
Coccoli, also known as "fried dough" or "panzerotti" (but also donzelle, zonzelle, ficattole...), are served as an appetizer in Tuscany with typical cold cuts, stracchino or cheeses. They originated as street food in Florence, a simple and rustic street food whose flavors have remained unchanged over time, even though today they are often served to enrich the bread basket. These delicious fried dough bites are made only with water, flour, and yeast: once mixed, they create a very soft dough to be dipped in boiling oil. They slightly resemble the Apulian Pettole in their irregular shape. Once perfectly golden, serve them piping hot, accompanied in the typical manner!

To prepare coccoli, pour the flour into a bowl, add the sugar , the crumbled yeast , and the water .
Finally, add the salt . Mix with a fork until you get a rough dough, trying to combine all the ingredients . Leave the dough at room temperature covered with plastic wrap for 2 hours.
Retrieve the leavened dough . Heat the seed oil and bring it to a temperature of 340°F. With the help of two spoons previously moistened with oil, slide the coccoli into the oil and cook until golden, it will take about 5 minutes.
Drain them on paper towels and serve them still hot with ham and stracchino cheese.
We recommend consuming fried coccoli immediately.
Fry a few pieces at a time to avoid lowering the oil temperature.
Coccoli can also be enjoyed with grilled vegetables for a vegetarian version.
