To prepare the mascarpone cream for pandoro and panettone in this version, raw eggs are used (refer to the 'tips' box at the end of the recipe for alternative solutions). First, soften the mascarpone with a spatula. Separate the yolks and whites and place them in two large bowls. Add half of the sugar amount to the yolks . Begin to whisk the yolks with an electric mixer, adding the sugar in two stages. As soon as the yolk and sugar mixture becomes lighter in color, gradually add the mascarpone while continuing to whisk. Keep mixing until it is completely absorbed.
Whisk the egg whites with an electric mixer while adding the other half of the sugar . The egg whites should become puffy and frothy .
Fold the whipped egg whites into the cream gently with a spatula, using an upward motion from the bottom to avoid deflating them . Once the egg whites are fully incorporated, your mascarpone cream for pandoro and panettone will be ready to enjoy .
It's best to prepare and consume the mascarpone cream for pandoro and panettone soon, and at most keep it for 1 day in the fridge, in an airtight container. If you use pasteurized eggs, it can last 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
We recommend using very fresh eggs. If you prefer to avoid raw eggs, you can buy pasteurized eggs at the supermarket. Homemade pasteurization can help, but it does not guarantee 100% safety.
You can flavor the cream with vanilla extract or by adding a liquor such as Rum or Grand Marnier.
