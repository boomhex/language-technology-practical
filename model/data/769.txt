instructions:
To prepare fettuccine with mushrooms and burrata, start by cleaning the mushrooms: first, remove most of the soil with a brush or a small brush . Cut off the bottom part of the stem and quickly rinse them under running water .
Cut them into small pieces of about 1/2 inch . Place a pot full of salted water on the heat and bring it to a boil; this will be used for cooking the pasta. Pour a drizzle of oil and a clove of garlic into a pan , and let it sauté for a few minutes. When it is golden, add the mushrooms , and cook them over medium heat for a few minutes.
When the mushrooms are cooked, turn off the heat, remove the garlic , and set them aside. Cook the fettuccine in boiling salted water for the time indicated on the package , being careful to keep them two minutes undercooked to finish cooking in the pan. Drain the fettuccine directly into the pan with the mushrooms .

Add two ladles of cooking water . Toss with a drizzle of oil and adjust the salt and pepper if necessary.
Finally, add the previously chopped aromatic herbs. Take bites from the burrata and place them on top of the fettuccine before serving them at the table .
We recommend consuming the fettuccine with mushrooms and burrata immediately.
