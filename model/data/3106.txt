Pollo Tandoori is a super flavorful dish straight from the heart of India. It originated from an experiment by a restaurant owner in Peshawar. And honestly, what makes this dish stand out is how the chicken is marinated in a mix of white yogurt and a bunch of spices. Really packs in the flavor! The tandoori chicken recipe uses chili powder to give it that bold red color, though sometimes turmeric is swapped in for a more orange look. Pretty cool, right? All these spices—think garam masala , curry, ginger, garlic, and even cayenne—come together to make every bite an adventure.
Traditionally, this chicken is cooked in a tandoor, a super hot clay oven that can hit up to 480°C. That’s where it gets its crispy edges and smoky vibe that people love. But even if you’re not using a tandoor at home, this easy tandoori chicken still comes out juicy and packed with flavor. I mean, seriously good.
In India, and other places like Central Asia and the Middle East, the tandoor is really popular. But home cooks have found ways to replicate the results with regular ovens or grills. You know, you don’t need any fancy gear—just a good marinade and a little patience. When you let the chicken marinate in the yogurt and spices, it soaks up all that tender, tangy goodness that makes it special. For real. Some folks even get creative, mixing their own blend with garam masala , curry powder, and whatever spices they have on hand.
What you end up with is a homemade tandoori chicken that turns golden and smells amazing as it cooks—making it hard to wait until it’s done. For sure. Whether you opt for oven-baked tandoori chicken or fire it up on the grill, you’ll find the flavors hit that perfect spot between spicy, moist, and just a bit smoky. That’s why this dish is perfect for parties, family dinners, or whenever you want something really really tasty and different. Can't go wrong.
To prepare tandoori chicken, start by removing the skin from the drumsticks and chicken thighs (1-2); alternatively, you can use other preferred chicken pieces like breasts or wings. Once skinned, place the chicken in a wide, shallow container .
Prepare the tandoori marinade: in a bowl, place the tandoori paste and ginger-garlic paste , ingredients that can be found in ethnic shops. Mix everything with plain yogurt and add the juice of half a lemon .
Finally, add the curry and adjust the salt if necessary then mix well and pour the marinade over the chicken , which should be completely covered by it. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave it in the refrigerator to marinate for 24 hours .
After this time, take the chicken and place the pieces on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, well spaced apart . Bake in a static oven preheated to 450°F for 40 minutes (or 400°F for 35 minutes in a fan-assisted oven). Remove the crispy tandoori chicken from the oven , take it off the tray, and serve it on a bed of salad or with pilaf rice!
Store the tandoori chicken in the refrigerator for 2-3 days covered with plastic wrap and heat it in the oven before serving. You can freeze it after cooking and defrost it when needed.
Traditionally in Indian cuisine, the tandoor is used for baking naan, the Indian bread, but Gunjral, a restaurant owner from Peshawar, tried cooking chicken in it, discovering that thanks to the live flame at the base of the oven and the radiant heat, the chicken became crispy on the outside and remained tender on the inside. Tandoori chicken was particularly appreciated by Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who was in office from 1947 to 1964, and he included it in the menu of official banquets, during which many important statesmen could try it, including Americans Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy.
Conscious of my love for spicy flavors, I didn't add extra chili (dried or fresh) to the recipe, which might be overwhelming for delicate palates, but I highly recommend it if you're up for it!
