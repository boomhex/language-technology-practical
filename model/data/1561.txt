To make the salmon sticks with herb mushroom cream, first clean the champignon mushrooms, trim the base and remove any soil residues with a cloth; then slice them thinly . Trim the spring onion and cut it into rings .
In a saucepan, pour the oil and add the garlic , sauté for 3 minutes over moderate heat and then add the spring onions and mushrooms
cook for another 3 minutes and add salt . Then remove the garlic and pour in the cream .
Turn off the heat and blend the mixture with an immersion blender until you get a smooth cream, add the fennel and marjoram and let it infuse. Once the sauce has cooled, pass it through a sieve to make it smoother.
Divide the salmon into 8 equal rectangles of about 1 x 4.5 inches . Pass each stick first in rice flour , then in beaten eggs
and finally in panko . Once you have breaded all the sticks , you can proceed to frying: place seed oil in a saucepan and heat it; when it reaches a temperature of 340°F you can immerse the sticks , a few pieces at a time, for about 2 minutes or until they are golden brown.
Once cooked, drain the sticks on absorbent paper . Flavor the salmon sticks with lemon zest and serve them hot with mushroom cream .
We recommend consuming the sticks immediately with mushroom cream. You can prepare the cream in advance and store it in the fridge. Freezing is not recommended.
Prefer a lighter cooking method? Bake them in a static oven at 350°F for 15 minutes, on the lowest shelf. Panko can be replaced with breadcrumbs and for a crispier breading, you can use corn flakes.
