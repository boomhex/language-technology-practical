Creamed cod with yogurt and purple potatoes really shows off how Venetian cuisine takes simple ingredients and turns them into something special. For real. In the beautiful Veneto region, folks have been making creamed cod, or “baccalà mantecato,” for ages. It’s been a staple. Traditionally, it’s all about whipping cooked cod with olive oil until it’s smooth and spreadable—so so good. This version adds a fresh twist with cod and yogurt and a pop of color from purple potatoes. The yogurt gives it a light, slightly tangy note—making the fish even more creamy but not heavy. And those purple potatoes? They don’t just look cool; they add a velvety texture. And pretty much works great with the smoothness of the cod. You’ll often spot this dish on slices of crunchy homemade bread at a Venetian gathering, especially when folks want to kick off a seafood dinner with something that stands out.
Here's the thing: what sets this creamed cod apart is its blend of old and new—traditional technique with updated flavors. The use of natural yogurt makes it taste fresh, a bit brighter than the classic olive oil-only version, while the purple potatoes add a tender contrast. People say the color alone grabs attention at the table, but it’s the taste that keeps 'em coming back. And look, it’s not just pretty; it’s a smart choice for anyone looking for healthy cod dishes or something lighter to start a meal. This appetizer manages to be both rich and delicate, blending the sea flavor of the cod with the mild earthiness of the potatoes. The yogurt ties everything together perfectly. Even though it sounds fancy, it’s the kind of dish that fits any gathering—easy enough for casual weekends yet special enough to surprise your guests. Venetian tradition meets a modern spin, resulting in a moist, eye-catching treat that elevates regular cod recipes. It’s a really notable way to enjoy the flavors of Venice, offering a taste that’s both comforting and innovative. Really really worth trying.
To prepare the creamed cod with yogurt and purple potatoes, you can use fresh cod fillets to boil until they turn white and tender, which will take about 10 minutes from boiling ; alternatively, you can use frozen ones following the same method. Place the potatoes in cold water and cook for about 15 minutes from boiling. Then drain and peel them, being careful not to burn yourself .
In a blender, add the cod and the peeled purple potatoes roughly cut into pieces along with the grated lemon zest (keep a small portion aside for final decoration) and the extra virgin olive oil .
Pepper to taste , adjust the salt , and start blending everything .
Keep the blender running while adding the plain yogurt , and blend until you obtain a smooth and whipped cream. Add the thyme leaves . Transfer the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a fluted nozzle and let it rest in the fridge for at least 10-15 minutes.
Cut 4 slices of rustic bread , then take the butter softened at room temperature and work it into a soft paste in a small bowl. Add the peeled and minced garlic and mix .
Spread the garlic butter on the slices of bread , then place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and toast the slices in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 17 minutes until they are well browned .
Serve your creamed cod mousse with yogurt and purple potatoes on the toasted bread , sprinkle with lemon zest , and add a few thyme leaves .
You can store the creamed cod inside the pastry bag for 1 day in the refrigerator.
Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of thyme, you can add fresh mint. An alternative reuse idea for this dish is to form rosettes to bake in the oven at 392°F for about 20 minutes, thus creating a reinterpretation of the “duchess potato.”
