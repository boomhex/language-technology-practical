instructions:
To make the crumble with custard, work the flour, baking powder , cold butter in pieces , the seeds of a vanilla bean, and salt in a bowl. Mix and crumble until you get a sandy consistency. Then add the sugar ,
the eggs , incorporate them and crumble the dough again with your fingers. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for 1 hour. Meanwhile, prepare the custard: pour the milk into a saucepan, add the sugar ,
the egg yolks , and the flour . Blend the ingredients with an immersion mixer to mix them .
Add the leftover vanilla bean from the dough and cook the cream over low heat, stirring with a whisk, for 6-7 minutes . When the cream has thickened, turn off the heat and remove the vanilla bean . Let the cream cool.
Line a 9-inch diameter mold with parchment paper. Pour a little more than half of the crumbled dough . Distribute it on the bottom and edge. Compact the dough with your hands . Pour the prepared cream, level it with a spatula, trying not to exceed the edges of the dough .
Cover the surface of the crumble with the remaining dough crumbs . Bake the dessert in a static oven, already hot, at 356°F for 1 hour. After 40 minutes, if the surface darkens too much, cover the dessert with a sheet of aluminum foil. After baking, take the crumble out with custard and let it cool before serving .
The crumble with custard and chocolate can be stored in the fridge for 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended. You can freeze only the shortcrust pastry, then thaw it and crumble it as per the recipe.
The vanilla pod can be replaced with lemon peel, both in the preparation of the shortcrust and the cream.
