It’s the kind of snack that shows up at the best aperitivo tables, especially when you want to impress with something a little different than the usual bread or crackers. Folks in Liguria know that pairing it with a few slices of cold cuts or some sharp cheeses makes for a pretty great start to any meal. A lot of olive bread baking in Liguria goes for that extra chewy texture, but this one is all about a tender, almost pillowy crumb. Really holds onto every bit of that salty, golden olive spread.

So here's the thing, for anyone curious about artisan bread baking at home and looking for a snack that’s a bit more special, this recipe checks all the boxes. Whether you’re enjoying a casual gathering or a fancy dinner, this Ligurian delight brings a taste of Italy right to your table. Can't go wrong.
To make the bread with olive pâté, first prepare the dough: sift the Manitoba flour into a large bowl , add the spelt flour , the dry yeast , malt, and mix everything together. You can also use fresh yeast (in this case, the amount to use is 12 g) and instead of malt, use a teaspoon of sugar.
Gradually add the water and start gathering the ingredients with your hands, finally adding the salt to the dough . Transfer the dough to the work surface .
Continue kneading with a dough scraper because the dough will be quite sticky . Continue until it becomes smooth and soft. Place the dough in a bowl with a slightly oiled bottom , cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in the oven turned off with the light on to create a warm environment for 2 hours. Pit the Taggiasca olives with a special tool or patiently with a knife you can take the flesh around the pit.
When the dough has risen well , grease a work surface with olive oil and transfer the dough on top , so it won't stick.
Flatten the dough: spread it into a rectangle and fill it with olive pâté, spreading it inside and leaving a few inches from the edge , overlap the long sides (15-16),
also fold the other ends . Then fold the rectangle over itself again, fill with pitted olives
and then roll the dough from the long side and fold the shorter sides , finally stretch it to form a loaf, sealing the edges well, as the folds are important because they give the right lift to the rise. Place the loaf on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, brush the loaf with a bit of oil and sprinkle sunflower and black sesame seeds on top . Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour in the oven turned off with the light on.
After the rising time , proceed with baking, place a bowl filled with water at the bottom of the oven to create a humid environment that will help bake the bread, then bake the bread in a static oven at 482°F for 25 minutes, after this time remove the bowl with water and lower the temperature to 392°F, continue baking for 10 minutes, then turn the loaf upside down and bake for another 10 minutes upside down. Once baking is complete, take the olive bread out and let it cool down .
Olive bread can be stored in a transparent or paper bag for 1-2 days at most. The dough can be frozen this way: let it rise, fill and shape the loaf, then place in the freezer wrapped in plastic wrap. Then thaw it in the refrigerator and let it come back to room temperature, let it rise for 1 hour in the oven turned off with the light on before baking as indicated.
As an alternative to Taggiasca olives, you can use already pitted black or green olives.
