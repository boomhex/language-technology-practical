Golden edges with a soft , buttery bite make Linzer cookies a real favorite on any cookie platter, especially when holiday cookies are part of the plan. These classic Austrian-style jam-filled cookies use a pretty cut-out shape—usually stars or hearts—that shows off the bold red pop of strawberry jam , perfect for family events where festive treats are the highlight (kids and adults both reach for them, trust me!). The finish? A simple, sweet dusting of powdered sugar for that Kris Kringle look—super CUTE and familiar. It’s the nutty almond flour that’s behind their unique flavor (and something most cookie fans spot right away…DELICIOUS), while the thick layer of jam gives each bite a little burst of tart, sweet goodness. At gatherings, the inviting colors and nice round shapes of these holiday cookies earn lots of wows—people always notice the cutouts and the shine from the filling.
Busy families lean toward these charming Linzer cookies for good reason—reliable results, beautiful presentation, and crowd-pleasing taste with every tray. They hold their pretty shape just right, perfect for holiday parties, after-school treats, or quick desserts when you just want something a little special with your coffee or tea. Want to change it up? These jam-filled cookies let you swap the strawberry jam for raspberry or apricot, so there’s almost always a good option for picky eaters or curious bakers (check what’s on hand in the fridge!). Because the texture is that ideal blend of soft and crisp, these shortbread cookies are great with drinks—tea, coffee, milk, whatever the family likes. For gifting or bringing to an event, these holiday cookies are pretty classic, since they keep their fresh look and still deliver big flavor after a couple days. With that nutty, buttery background from the almond flour, they’re a dependable hit—families love sharing them, swapping filling flavors, and enjoying their pretty shapes at any time of year.

To prepare the Tyrolean cookies with strawberry jam, start by placing the flour in a fountain shape on a work surface (or in a large bowl), previously mixed with baking powder and sifted, sugar, the seeds from a vanilla bean, salt, butter in pieces , and the egg . Mix and knead all the ingredients well ,
until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough. Then wrap it with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for an hour. After the necessary time, take the dough, roll it out to a thickness of about 1/8 inch, and use cutters or a pastry ring to create circular shapes about 2 inches in diameter . You should have an even number, as each cookie consists of a whole bottom part and a top part with three holes (which you'll make with an apple corer) ;
Then place the paired cookie shapes on a baking sheet pre-lined with parchment paper . Bake the cookies and let them cook for about 20 minutes at 350°F: remember they should not darken, so if you see them start to brown, remove them and lower the oven temperature. As soon as they are baked, while still warm, take a non-holed shape and place half a teaspoon of jam in the center ; then place on top, pressing lightly, a shape with holes and place the assembled cookie on a tray: do this with the remaining shapes. When you're finished, sprinkle all the cookies with plenty of vanilla powdered sugar.
To fill the Tyrolean cookies, you can use jams of any kind, as long as they do not contain large chunks, as these would prevent the proper closure of the two shapes that form the cookies.
