To prepare the strawberry and apricot jam with vanilla , start by washing the apricots and strawberries under running water (2-3).
Detach the apricots' stems with your fingers , then remove the pit by splitting the apricots in half with a small knife ; finally, cut the apricots into small pieces .
Trim the strawberries, removing the stems and cut them into small pieces as well . Gather the fruit pieces in two bowls .
Cut a vanilla bean lengthwise and use the tip of a small knife to extract the seeds . Alternatively, you can use a packet of vanillin or a teaspoon of vanilla extract. In a tall and spacious stainless steel pot, pour in the apricot pieces and
the strawberry pieces . Add the vanilla seeds to the fruit in the pot along with the cut bean ; the vanilla will give the jam a more intense flavor. These operations should be done with the heat off.
In a bowl, place 1.5 cups of granulated sugar and add the 3:1 mix , then stir the two ingredients with a spoon . Add the sugar mixture to the fruit in the pot, directly ,
Bring the mixture to a boil, keeping the heat high and continuing to stir to prevent it from sticking to the bottom . Once it reaches a boil, let it boil for 3 minutes on high heat, always stirring . Remove the pot from the heat and take out the vanilla bean
and stir the jam, dissolving any foam . Prepare the jars, which you have sanitized, and get a funnel to assist in filling the jars with the jam . Pour the still-boiling strawberry and apricot jam with vanilla into the jars with the help of a ladle
and continue until the jars are filled, taking care to leave about half an inch from the rim , then with the appropriate lids, close them , tightening well and ensuring they are hermetically sealed. With the heat of the jam, a vacuum will form, allowing the product to be stored for a long time. Once the jars have cooled, check if the vacuum has been achieved: you can press the center of the lid, and if you don't hear the usual "click-clack" sound, the vacuum is present. Your strawberry and apricot jam with vanilla is ready .
The strawberry and apricot jam with vanilla can be stored in a cool, dry place away from sources of light and heat for about 6 months. Once opened, the strawberry and apricot jam with vanilla should be kept in the refrigerator and consumed within a few days; for this reason, we recommend storing the jam in small jars to quickly use up the contents once opened.
If you love jams with a more tart taste, you can flavor the strawberry and apricot jam with lemon peels, which you should remove after cooking.
Homemade preparation of preserves and jams can present health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the necessary conditions and measures to ensure the safety and suitability of the foods, while industrial procedures can prevent dangerous contamination. It is therefore important to strictly follow food safety guidelines to reduce risks, but one should always keep in mind that the same level of food safety as professionally produced preserves and jams cannot be achieved. For proper preparation of homemade preserves, refer to the guidelines from the Ministry of Health .
