Let's chat about monkey bread . This fun and super tasty treat is perfect for any gathering. It's really an American favorite. You start with a big batch of dough, broken down into soft, little balls. People often call it a "puzzle"—which is great—because you're piecing these spheres together to make something special. The classic way? Fill each ball with orange marmalade or your favorite jam. Then, roll them in melted butter and a heavenly mix of brown sugar and cinnamon . Once everything’s packed into a pan and baked, you get this amazing pull-apart bread that’s so so tender and sweet in every bite.
And here's the thing, the magic of this dish is how the cinnamon and sugar melt and bubble together. It creates this sticky, gooey crust that's hard to resist. Seriously good stuff. Your kitchen fills with aromatic notes that make you feel all cozy and at home. This cinnamon sugar bread is a hit with both kids and adults who just love tearing off pieces. It's got that playful, communal vibe. Whether it’s breakfast or an afternoon snack, monkey bread fits right in.
Some folks keep it simple by making plain dough balls. And you know what? That lets you really really appreciate how moist and pillowy the inside is. But if you’re up for something extra gooey and flavorful, jam filling is awesome. There are countless variations, like using chocolate or adding more butter and cinnamon for a super-rich version.
The best part? You don’t need anything fancy. Get your dough together, roll, fill, and let the oven do its magic. This easy monkey bread recipe is a staple at brunches and family gatherings. It’s so shareable and hands-on. Pretty simple. Whether you call it homemade monkey bread , sticky bread, or a breakfast pastry, it's the kind of food that brings people together and makes them smile. For sure.
To prepare the monkey bread, start with the dough: in a small bowl, dissolve the dry yeast (alternatively, you can use 12 g of fresh brewer's yeast) in lukewarm milk , while in another bowl pour the water and add the salt , stirring to dissolve it. In the bowl of a stand mixer, pour the sifted flour and add the sugar .
Also pour in the milk in which you have dissolved the yeast and start the mixer at medium speed. Then add the water in which you dissolved the salt , the whole egg , and when it is fully incorporated, also add the yolk, always with the mixer running.
When the eggs are also fully incorporated, attach the hook and continue to work the dough until it is soft and smooth . Transfer it to a bowl , cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise at a temperature between 78-82°F for about 2 hours.
After the dough has doubled in volume, prepare the coating: melt the butter in a saucepan, then transfer it to a small bowl, while in another pour the brown sugar and cinnamon . Then take the dough , handle it on a work surface, and form balls about 1 inch in diameter : these will give the cake its particular shape.
With your fingers, make an indentation in each ball and fill it with a teaspoon of orange marmalade . Then seal the balls by tightly closing the edges .
Roll the balls first in melted butter then in the brown sugar and cinnamon mix . Grease and flour a tall and deep bundt pan and place the balls next to each other and then create an upper layer .
Let the monkey bread rise for about an hour at room temperature . Then bake it in a preheated static oven at 375°F for 40 minutes (if using a convection oven, 340°F for 30-35 minutes): at the end of baking, the monkey bread should be golden . While the cake is baking, you can prepare the milk glaze: bring the milk to a boil in a saucepan, then pour it in a thin stream into a bowl where you have sifted powdered sugar .
Stir with a teaspoon until you get a fluid mixture . Now that the cake is baked and the glaze is ready, you can decorate the monkey bread: pour the glaze into a piping bag and use the smallest nozzle (or create a small tip with a disposable piping bag). Decorate the cake with vertical and horizontal glaze lines covering the upper layer of balls . It will be fun to enjoy the monkey bread by easily pulling the balls apart with your hands. Serve it warm or hot!
The monkey bread remains soft for a short time, so it's best consumed while still hot or warm. It can be stored in a food bag for up to one day. The dough can be frozen raw and defrosted in the refrigerator, then brought back to room temperature before baking the cake.
You can fill the monkey bread with other jams or preserves, or enjoy it plain.
Monkey bread is a beloved and widespread dessert in the United States, even found ready-made in the supermarket. However, little information is available about its origins, especially its name, but what is certain is that the first monkey bread recipe was published in the 1950s and has since conquered all American cafes.
