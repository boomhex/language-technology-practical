Pasta c’anciova —oh man, it's a classic from Palermo, Italy. And listen, it’s all about showing how just a few simple ingredients can make something really special. This pasta with anchovies is not just about the salty kick from the anchovies. It's also got this super crunchy muddica atturriata —toasted breadcrumbs on top. In Sicily, they call it the "poor man’s grated cheese." And you know what? It adds that crunchy texture and savory flavor. Really good stuff.
You’ll often find pine nuts, and sometimes almonds, mixed in. Which is great. They bring a nutty, toasty note to the sauce. Some folks throw in concentrated tomato for extra depth—makes it a bit sweet and tangy. To be honest, it’s amazing how this anchovy pasta recipe pulls together pantry basics to create something that feels, well, kinda fancy but still humble. It's not just a staple in Palermo but across Sicily. Spaghetti with anchovies sits right there with island favorites like pasta con le sarde.
The breadcrumb tradition? Long history. Still super popular because it gives a nice crisp to every bite, keeping the dish from feeling too heavy. The anchovy pasta sauce isn’t overly fishy, but it’s savory and packed with umami. Some Sicilian families add toasted almonds for that extra crunch and a bit of richness. Across the region, variations are all over—some folks skip the tomato, making it more like pasta con le sarde bianca. These small tweaks really highlight the variety in seafood pasta recipes in Mediterranean cuisine.
Trying pasta c’anciova lets you savor Sicily's traditional flavors using simple ingredients. And look, it delivers a ton of satisfying taste and texture in every forkful. Whether you’re a fan of sticking to tradition or you like messing around with ingredients, this dish is a testament to Sicily's rich culinary heritage. It offers a taste of history and tradition in each bite. Seriously good.

To prepare pasta with anchovies, start by pouring the anchovies into a pan with oil and stir often so they don't dissolve completely. Then add finely chopped garlic followed by pine nuts and raisins , and let them flavor for a couple of minutes.

At this point, add the tomato paste and water . Add salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar, cover it, and let it cook for 10 minutes on low heat .
Meanwhile, put the pot with water for pasta on the stove and also prepare the "toasted breadcrumbs" (i.e., toasted breadcrumbs). Put the almonds in a bag and crush them coarsely with a meat mallet or weight . Pour the breadcrumbs into a non-stick pan and add the crumbled almonds .
Add oil and a pinch of salt, then toast over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent burning : it should become a nice toasted color. At this point, cook salted boiling water and cook the pasta . When it's al dente, drain it into the pot to adjust with the sauce, stir , and serve your pasta with anchovies with a sprinkle of toasted breadcrumbs and chopped parsley if desired.
Once the pasta with anchovies is ready, it's best to consume it immediately.
If you wish, you can prepare the sauce in advance and store it in the refrigerator for up to two days.
The original toasted breadcrumbs are without almonds, so you can omit them if you don't like them. Adding them will give a touch of crunchiness and uniqueness to the dish.
