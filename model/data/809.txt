instructions:
To prepare the mezze maniche with eggplants and smoked scamorza, start with the eggplants: clean them, cut them into cubes of about 3/4 inch and place them in a colander with a pinch of salt , then place a weight on top for at least half an hour. This way, they will release the bitter water .
After this time, heat a swirl of oil in a pan with a peeled clove of garlic , add the eggplants and let them cook over medium heat for 6-7 minutes . Meanwhile, cut the cherry tomatoes into quarters .
Add them to the eggplants , mix, adjust with salt and pepper , and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally .
Cube the smoked scamorza and start cooking the pasta in boiling salted water . When it is al dente, drain it and add it to the dressing .
Add the cubes of scamorza , give a quick flick of the wrist, just enough for the cheese to start melting a bit , and you can finally plate. Your mezze maniche with eggplants and smoked scamorza are ready to be enjoyed with a bit of torn basil on each plate .
The mezze maniche with eggplants and smoked scamorza can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.
Instead of fresh cherry tomatoes, you can use tomato puree.
Grate some salted ricotta on top, like a Norma but lighter.
For a version enriched with flavor, add crumbled sausage.
