To prepare the cotechino ravioli with lentil sauce, start by making the Homemade pasta (sheets and shapes) : place the sifted flours in a bowl and pour the eggs and a pinch of salt into the center. Then start working the ingredients by mixing with a fork , gradually widening to take the flour. Then start working with your hands for at least 10 minutes,
kneading and banging the dough on the pastry board until you obtain a soft and homogeneous mixture . Form a dough ball and wrap it with plastic wrap , then let it rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, continue with the sauce preparation: first, rinse the lentils under running water ;
place them inside a pressure cooker, pour the water in to cover them completely . Close the pot and cook for 20 minutes, then let them cool . In a non-stick pot, sauté the oil with the shallot, garlic, celery, and finely chopped carrot over low heat .
Add the rosemary as well and stir with a spatula. Add the lentils and cover the pot with a lid, letting it cook on low heat for about 10 minutes. Stir often to ensure they don't dry out too much and
adjust the salt and pepper. When ready, turn off the heat and proceed with cooking the cotechino: take a precooked cotechino and place it in a pot with cold water; turn on the heat and boil it according to the instructions on the package (it will take about 15 minutes) . Once the required time has passed, drain it and place it in a bowl to remove the outer casing , being careful not to burn yourself with the liquid in the package.
Remove the cotechino skin , then finely chop it with a knife in a bowl . Add 50 g of the lentils you prepared to the meat and mix with a spatula: your filling is ready.
At this point, take the egg pasta dough and place it on the lightly floured work surface. Roll it out with a rolling pin , divide it and make 8 sheets of 24x16 inches, as thin as possible, using a pasta machine . Place a teaspoon (about 5 g) of the filling you prepared on the sheet , leaving about 1-1.5 inches between each dollop of filling;
then overlap another sheet of the same size ; press lightly to remove all the air trapped between the two sheets . Use a star-shaped cutter to make your ravioli , repeating the operation until all ingredients are used and re-kneading the scraps: with our doses, you should obtain 40 ravioli.
as you make them, place them on a floured towel . Put a pot with plenty of water on the stove to prepare the Vegetable broth . Boil the ravioli in salted boiling water for about 4-5 minutes , then drain them .
In the meantime, transfer the cooked leftover lentils into a tall-sided container. Blend with an immersion blender, gradually adding 2 oz of broth . When the sauce reaches the right consistency, strain it with a sieve to make it more homogeneous . In a non-stick pan, heat the lentil sauce together with the leftover broth , then
add the ravioli and toss for a few seconds. At the end of cooking, turn off the heat and add the chopped parsley . Your cotechino ravioli with lentil sauce are ready to be enjoyed and served .
Once cooked, it is recommended to consume the cotechino ravioli hot. You can prepare them in advance and freeze them for up to 1 month: for freezing, place the tray with the ravioli in the freezer to harden for a couple of hours. When they are well hardened, put them in freezer bags, preferably already portioned, and place them back in the freezer. When you need to use them, boil them directly from frozen in boiling water and proceed according to the recipe.
If you want to make your lentil sauce even more flavorful, try using red lentils, which are very tender and tasty!
