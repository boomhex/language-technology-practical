Baked peppers—oh man—are one of those dishes that everyone in Southern Italy loves. And for good reason! Especially when bell peppers hit their peak. Seriously good stuff. In places like Campania and Calabria, baked peppers are just everywhere. They roast nice and slow, so they get super tender. And, you know, that slight darkening of the skin? Gives them this awesome smoky flavor. Pretty simple but tasty. So, you can have them as a side, or, just pile them on some toasted bread. Really, either way works great.
And here’s the thing—the magic happens when you toss on some chopped garlic and parsley. It adds that fresh and sharp vibe. Plus, those classic Taggiasca olives from the South? They give a salty, deep taste that’s, well, pretty much impossible to fake. Trust me, once you try them, you’ll know. Compared to basic roasted peppers, these Italian oven-baked peppers bring layers of flavor. They’re simple but never ever boring.
Honestly, whenever friends come over, they disappear way too fast. And in those southern kitchens? You’ll find so so many creative twists. Some folks love to throw in capers for a briny kick. Or they roll their peppers with fillings like tuna or sausage—sometimes even ground meat. Stuffed peppers aren’t just a northern thing. Southern Italy’s got its own twist, using breadcrumbs or cheese instead of meat, which is great for a vegetarian stuffed peppers feel.
No question, an easy baked peppers recipe gives you that perfect balance of moist texture and sweet pepper taste. It’s balanced with savory notes from olives and herbs. Perfect as a side with grilled chicken, or just let it be the star with fresh bread. And look, whatever version you pick, those colorful colors and crispy edges make these roasted peppers stand out on any table. They’re proof—yeah, proof—that you don’t need fancy ingredients to create really really good food. Just a few quality items and a little time in the oven.

A drizzle of balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar added at the end, before serving, will provide a touch of acidity that pairs wonderfully with the sweetness of the peppers.
For a heartier version, serve the peppers with anchovies and capers, or with shavings of pecorino cheese or lard!
