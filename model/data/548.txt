instructions:
To prepare the Spoon Sacher, start with the ganache. Chop the dark chocolate and transfer it to a bowl. Heat the cream until almost boiling and pour it in three batches into the bowl with the chocolate .
Stir each time with a spatula to melt the chocolate well , until you get a smooth and fluid ganache. Now take 4 glasses of 6.8 oz. Pour about two fingers of ganache inside . Transfer to the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes, keeping the remaining ganache at room temperature to prevent it from solidifying. Now take the glasses again and pour about 2 oz of apricot jam into each one .
Pour the rest of the ganache into the glasses and transfer back to the fridge for another 15 minutes. In the meantime, whip the cream leaving it quite soft; it should be semi-whipped . Transfer it into the glasses .
Decorate with chocolate curls , pieces of dried apricots , and serve your glasses .
You can store the glasses in the fridge for 2-3 days, preferably without the cream on top. If the ganache solidifies while composing the glasses, heat it in the microwave for a few seconds.
For a crunchy note, also add some crumbled cocoa biscuits to the bottom. If the ganache solidifies, heat it in the microwave for a few seconds before pouring it a second time into the glasses.
