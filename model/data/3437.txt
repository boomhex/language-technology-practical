To prepare the minted broad beans, start by washing the beans, then shell them from their pod , split them by making a cut on the side of the eye and squeezing to release the seed and set them aside.
Finely chop the parsley and the onion . Take a large pan, heat two tablespoons of oil and then add the diced bacon ,
the onion , the parsley , and the mint leaves . Sauté everything for a few minutes until the onion is wilted.
Then add the broad beans , deglaze with the white wine, add salt and pepper, and cook for about twenty minutes, occasionally adding the vegetable broth . The cooking time may vary depending on how large and tender the beans are. Once cooked , serve the beans hot, garnished with a few fresh mint leaves.
Alternatively, you can vary the preparation process by avoiding the sautéing: stew the beans and the herbs in a pot with the vegetable broth until the beans are well cooked.
