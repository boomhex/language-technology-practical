instructions:
To prepare the jam cake, pour the eggs, yolk, and sugar into a bowl . Whip with an electric mixer for about 5 minutes until you get a fluffy, light, and frothy mixture . Add the flour .
Also add the cornstarch and incorporate it with the mixer , then pour in the vegetable oil .
Also add the cold milk , grated lemon zest , and baking powder .
Mix well with the mixer until you obtain a smooth and uniform batter . Take a 9.5-inch pan, butter and flour it , then pour the batter inside . Transfer to the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
Remove the mold from the refrigerator and add spoonfuls of jam , then bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 35 minutes. Always perform the toothpick test to check the cooking inside. As soon as cooked, turn off the oven and leave the cake in the oven with the door open for 5 minutes. Then remove from the oven, let cool, and sprinkle the jam cake with powdered sugar before serving .
You can store the jam cake under a glass dome for 2-3 days.
You can use any jam you prefer to fill the cake! Store the jam jar in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours before using it: this way, you'll make its addition to the batter less "slippery," preventing it from sinking during baking.
Instead of oil, you can also use butter to grease the pan. Replace the lemon zest with other flavors like vanilla or cinnamon.
