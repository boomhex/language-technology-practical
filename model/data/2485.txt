instructions:
To prepare the saffron cake, start by pouring the eggs into the bowl of a stand mixer equipped with beaters (you can also use an electric mixer) , add half of the sugar, and start whisking the eggs ; you can flavor the other half with the saffron , stirring well to blend it.
Then add the flavored sugar to the egg mixture and continue to whisk. Meanwhile, melt the butter and let it cool slightly; sift the all-purpose flour, potato starch, and baking powder into a bowl (5-6),
add the hazelnut flour and when the egg and sugar mixture is light and frothy , add the mixed flours with the baking powder, one tablespoon at a time .
Continue working the batter and when the flours are absorbed, finally pour in the slightly cooled melted butter . When all the ingredients are well incorporated, transfer the batter into a greased and lined 9-inch cake tin . Then distribute the batter evenly with a spatula . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 30 minutes (or at 320°F for about 20 minutes if using a convection oven).
Once cooked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool slightly, then unmold it and let it cool completely before placing it on a serving plate and sprinkling it with powdered sugar . Serve the saffron cake for a curious snack or a special breakfast !
Store the saffron cake under a glass dome for 2-3 days.
It can be frozen.
Instead of hazelnut flour, you can make the dough with pistachio or almond flour!
