Zucca allo zenzero is a classic from Northern Italy, particularly Piedmont, where pumpkin season is a big deal every fall. And I mean, a big deal. In this part of Italy, pumpkin isn’t just for pies or soups—it shows up everywhere. Think sweet cookies, cakes, hearty tortelli, and even risotti. This pumpkin and ginger dish is all about showing off pumpkin's versatility. Really, it mixes zingy fresh ginger with a sprinkle of crumbled amaretti cookies for a little sweet and a bit tangy kick.
Folks in Piedmont love pumpkin in both traditional and new ways. Seriously, it's true. This combo gives you that warm, moist comfort with a spicy ginger twist that wakes everything up. The citrusy, spicy notes of ginger enhance the pumpkin’s natural flavor, making this pumpkin ginger side dish something you didn’t know you needed. For real. It's perfect alongside slow-cooked meats or your favorite roast.
In Sicily, dishes like zucca in saor and zucca in agrodolce play with similar tender and sweet flavors. However, Piedmont’s take with ginger and amaretti is a bit different. And here's the thing—it’s like a mix between savory and dessert. This pumpkin ginger recipe is ideal as a quick side for rich dishes, especially those long-braised beef or pork meals common in the region. That golden sautéed pumpkin, with its mellow sweetness and spicy ginger touch, feels like fall on your plate—especially when topped with crunchy amaretti cookie bits.
You don’t need a ton of fancy ingredients to whip this up. Pretty simple, right? It fits perfectly with other easy pumpkin recipes often found in Italian kitchens during pumpkin season. Anyone who enjoys trying new autumn side dishes or wants a healthy pumpkin recipe that's not boring will really like this, especially if you’re into those ginger-infused dishes that wake up your taste buds. Whether it’s a festive gathering or a cozy family dinner, this dish adds a tasty twist to your table, making it a must-try this season. So, there you have it.
To make pumpkin with ginger, start by cleaning the pumpkin, cut it in half and then into slices , remove the seeds and internal filaments, peel it, and cut it into cubes of about 3/4 inch . Peel the ginger with a vegetable peeler or a paring knife
and cut it into small cubes . Wash the leek, trim it, remove the outer leaves, the roots, and keep the white part of the stalk, which you will slice into thin rounds . Place a large pan on the stove, add the leeks , season with olive oil, and fry for at least 5-6 minutes or as long as it takes to soften the leek.
At this point, pour in a ladle of hot broth , to prepare the vegetable broth, consult the Vegetable broth guide. Add the diced ginger and pumpkin cubes ,
adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper , add another ladle of broth and cook over medium heat for about 25-30 minutes, adding broth a little at a time to prevent the vegetables from drying out too much. They should be soft but not falling apart. When the pumpkin is tender, turn off the heat, and season with a teaspoon of sweet paprika .
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, crumble the amaretti and add them to the pumpkin and mix. Your pumpkin with ginger is ready to be served.
Store the pumpkin with ginger in the refrigerator for a maximum of a couple of days, tightly sealed in a container.
If what holds you back from trying this recipe is the ginger, which you really don't like, no problem: flavor the pumpkin with rosemary sprigs or fresh or powdered chili instead. If, while you're at it, you let a glass of dry white wine evaporate during cooking, you'll be close to perfection!
