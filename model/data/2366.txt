To prepare corn dogs, start by preparing the batter. In a large bowl, pour the cornmeal and all-purpose flour . Add the salt and sugar .
Then add the baking soda and paprika . Now take a hand whisk and begin to mix the ingredients while gradually adding the room temperature milk .
Add an egg and continue whisking until you get a lump-free and fairly thick mixture . Pour the batter into a tall, cylindrical container and set it aside. At this point, take the sausages and cut them in half .
Skewer the uncut end of the sausage with the stick . Repeat the operation for all the sausages. Then roll them in flour, making sure to completely cover the surface of the sausage , and then dip them into the previously prepared batter . Let the excess batter drip off slightly,
and immerse them one at a time in vegetable oil, previously heated and brought to a temperature of 340°F (use a kitchen thermometer to reach the exact temperature) . Fry each piece for about 3-4 minutes until it is golden brown. Place the corn dogs on a paper towel to remove excess oil , then serve them while they're still hot .
It is best to consume the corn dogs freshly fried and still hot.
They can be frozen after frying and thawed at room temperature. Before enjoying, you can heat them in the oven for a few minutes.
If you have leftover batter, you can store it in the refrigerator for no more than 12 hours.
