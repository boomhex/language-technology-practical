instructions:
To prepare the quick chocolate cake, first melt the butter, either in the microwave for 30 seconds or in a small pan over low heat for 2 minutes, and let it cool. In a bowl, sift the flour , baking powder for cakes , and unsweetened cocoa .
Add the sugar and mix the dry ingredients . While continuing to mix, slowly add the milk .
You should obtain a homogeneous mixture . Add the melted butter and vanilla extract . Mix until you get a fairly firm batter ; if it is too stiff, add another tablespoon of milk.
Also add ¼ cup of chocolate chips, taken from the total , and mix one last time to distribute them evenly in the batter. Transfer everything to a 9-inch springform pan, sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips over the cake surface . Bake in a static oven at 350°F for 35 minutes; perform the toothpick test to check for doneness. The quick chocolate cake is ready , let it cool before removing it from the pan and serving.
Store the quick chocolate cake at room temperature, preferably under a glass dome, for up to 3-4 days. It can be frozen, already portioned, for up to 3 months.
To flavor the cake, instead of vanilla extract, you can use almond extract, cinnamon, or the grated zest of organic citrus fruits. You can add chopped nuts to the batter.
