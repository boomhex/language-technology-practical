instructions:
To prepare the baked ricotta with lemon, start by separating the egg whites from the yolks (the eggs can be cold from the fridge) . Whisk the egg whites until stiff using an electric mixer and set aside . In another large bowl, pour in the ricotta ,
the powdered sugar , and the yolks. Work at medium-low speed using the mixer again . As soon as the mixture is homogeneous
you can turn off the mixer and grate the lemon zest . Then squeeze the lemons to obtain 50 grams (1/4 cup) of juice to add to the bowl along with the cream ; work again with the mixer.
Sift the potato starch and incorporate it into the mixture . Finally, gently fold in the whipped egg whites using a spatula with gentle movements from the bottom up . At this point, butter a 9.5-inch Bundt pan (6.3 inches at the base and 3.5 inches deep). Then dust it with potato starch and pour the mixture, leveling it with a spatula . Bake in a preheated static oven at 338°F for 65 minutes; then another 10 minutes on the lowest rack (not in direct contact with the oven base).
Once the dessert is baked, let it cool completely before removing it onto the serving plate (14-15).
You can store the baked ricotta with lemon for 2-3 days in the refrigerator covered with a cloche.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you want to embellish and add a touch of extra color to your baked ricotta with lemon, add poppy seeds to the mix. Also try a different version using cow's ricotta instead of sheep's. Finally, to characterize it further, add some candied ginger cubes: you'll taste a specialty!
