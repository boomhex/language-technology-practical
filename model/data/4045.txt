The Green beans Pugliese style , as the name suggests, represent a typical and tasty side dish from Puglia. They are prepared by boiling them in salted water, then sautéing them in a pan with a sauce made from peeled tomatoes flavored with extra virgin olive oil, garlic, chili pepper, and parsley. Puglia is a land rich in vegetables, which are widely used in local recipes, even to dress many traditional pasta dishes; first among them, the famous "orecchiette with turnip tops."

To prepare the Green beans Pugliese style, start by trimming the green beans one by one, removing any strings, which shouldn't be present in tender or young beans ; wash them with cold water and boil them for about 15/20 minutes in salted water, then let them drain in a colander. Meanwhile, wash and chop the parsley, and sieve (or use a food mill for) the peeled tomatoes .
Place the oil in a pan, the fresh chili from which you can first remove the seeds, and the crushed garlic, which you will let brown; add the tomato purée and let it cook over high heat for a few minutes, then add the green beans, adjust the salt, and let it cook for another 5 minutes ; at this point, turn off the heat, sprinkle everything with chopped parsley , mix and serve the Green beans Pugliese style.
The Green beans Pugliese style are a tasty side dish that can also be served warm or at room temperature. Alternatively, you could use them as a topping for a nice pasta dish, which you will sprinkle with plenty of grated cheese.
