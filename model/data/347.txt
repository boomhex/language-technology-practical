instructions:
To prepare the gratinated prawns, first cut the crust from the semolina bread to obtain the crumb. Cut it into cubes and place it in a mixer, add the parsley , lemon zest , and blend for 1 minute.
Add the peanut oil and blend again for 1 minute. Transfer everything to a bowl , add the panko, and mix well . Set aside.
Now, focus on cleaning the prawns. With the help of scissors, remove the legs and cut the shell starting from the head to the tail . Score the flesh with a knife to create space for the breading .
Stuff the prawns and place them on a baking sheet with the breading facing up . Bake at 392°F for about 15 minutes, until completely golden. Your gratinated prawns are ready to be enjoyed .
The baked prawns should be consumed as soon as they are ready, but if there are leftovers, you can store them in the fridge, in a closed container, for up to 1 day.
The recipe can be modified according to your tastes, by adding ingredients to the breading, for example: finely chopped garlic, chili pepper, ginger, or grated cheese.
