To prepare the crunchy baskets with eggplant and zucchini caponata, wash all the vegetables under plenty of fresh running water. Trim the eggplants and cut them into cubes , then arrange them in layers in a colander placed over a bowl ,
sprinkling coarse salt between each layer . Cover with a plate and place a weight on top so that the eggplants release their moisture ; let it rest for 1 hour. After the necessary time, rinse the eggplants from the excess salt under running water ,
then dry them with a tea towel . Trim the zucchinis, cut them into rounds, and then dice them . In a non-stick pan, let the finely sliced onion wilt with half the oil over low heat (if the onion darkens, you can add a drop of water), then add the zucchini pieces, cooking them for 2 minutes .
Add the tomato sauce , adjusting the salt and pepper to taste and stirring with a wooden spoon; let it cook for another 10 minutes. In another pan, heat the oil, then cook the eggplant cubes for 3-4 minutes .
When the two preparations are ready , combine them and mix everything with a spatula . Add the sugar ,
pour the vinegar and let it evaporate over medium heat for 3-4 minutes . Finally, add some basil leaves ; turn off the heat and let it cool; meanwhile, prepare the baskets: place molds or steel rings with a diameter of 3 inches and height of 1 inch on a baking sheet lined with a sheet of parchment paper. Take one disc of dough at a time
and place it inside the molds, crimping the edges to form a basket ; brush the discs with the egg , then bake them in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 15 minutes (or at 356°F for 8-10 minutes if in a fan oven). Once ready , let the baskets cool.
Then take the baskets and place them on a serving plate; unmold them , then fill them with a couple of spoonfuls of the caponata you prepared . Finish by adding some basil leaves for garnishing: your crunchy baskets with eggplant and zucchini caponata are ready to be served and enjoyed !
