instructions:
To prepare the pizza rolls, start with the filling ingredients. So slice and chop the spicy salami into small pieces , grate the caciocavallo cheese and set aside , chop the sun-dried tomatoes and olives.
Once everything is ready, move on to the pizza dough, already prepared. Cut the dough into 4 pieces of about 3.5 oz each and flatten with your hands on a lightly floured surface . Roll out to a thickness of 1/4 inch .
Then start filling the center with salami , pitted olives, and pieces of sun-dried tomatoes . Then add a bit of crumbled ricotta by hand .
Add the basil torn by hand and the grated caciocavallo you set aside , a drizzle of oil , and proceed to close the ends by bringing them upwards .
Pinch the ends together tightly using kitchen twine . The first roll is ready, continue with the others. Grease a baking dish and arrange the rolls .
Drizzle a little oil over the surface of the pizza rolls . The pizza rolls are ready for baking: bake in a preheated static oven at 450°F for about 15 minutes . Once done baking, take them out; all that's left is to enjoy them hot .
The pizza rolls can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days in a covered container. If you prefer, they can also be frozen either raw or cooked.
Choose the type of topping you prefer based on your taste and seasonality! If you want to brown the surface more, you can try brushing the pizza dough with an egg yolk or cream before baking.
