Piadina is often hailed as the queen of street food in Romagna , and honestly, it's easy to see why. This Italian flatbread has deep roots in the region, popping up in all sorts of ways. And the version with vegetable gratin ? That's a fresh twist on the traditional piadina recipe . Picture thick, tender sticks of veggies—zucchini, peppers, and carrots—tossed with rosemary and sage, then roasted until they're all golden and delicious. Really, really different from the usual prosciutto and cheese, but just as satisfying.
The thing is, what makes this one pop is the creamy squacquerone cheese. For real, it is about as classic Romagna as you can get. People love how it melts right into the warm, moist bread, mingling with the crispy veggie edges for a bite that's both familiar and exciting. And look, the beauty of the piadina is totally in the fillings, and this version proves it. The roasted veggie sticks add a sweet touch, while a delicate arugula sauce brings a tangy zip that really wakes everything up—way more interesting than just tossing in some salad leaves, pretty much.
You'll find this style of grilled vegetable piadina at beachside kiosks or cozy cafés all around Emilia-Romagna, especially during summer. You know, when the markets are just overflowing with fresh produce. The cool thing is how the recipe stays grounded in traditional Italian recipes but isn’t scared to switch things up. Swapping out meats for veggies makes this stand out on lists of healthy flatbread recipes , showing you don't need fancy stuff for big flavor. Whether you are into vegetarian piadina fillings or just in the mood for something that feels both fresh and creative, this dish has got you covered. It's a real staple for folks who love food that's simple, rich, and totally easy to eat with your hands. Perfect for those lazy afternoons when you want something that's not only tasty but also a little bit different. Cannot go wrong.
To prepare the flatbread with grilled vegetables, first clean the peppers by removing the top part and the seeds inside. Cut them in half and use a knife to also remove the filaments . Then cut into slices about 0.8 inches thick and from these, cut sticks about 0.2 inches wide . You will need about half of each type of pepper, obtaining about 4 oz of sticks for each type of pepper, which you will gradually transfer to a large bowl.
Move on to the zucchini, cut it in half lengthwise and then cut it again into halves . Cut slices about 0.2 inches thick and from these, cut sticks of the same thickness as the peppers . When you have obtained 7 oz of them, transfer them along with the peppers.
Do the same with the eggplants, dividing them into 4 as just done (7-8). Then cut slices of 0.2 inches and again sticks . You will need 10 oz of these; add them along with the other vegetables.
Then chop the aromatic herbs and transfer them into a bowl . Add the oil ,
the breadcrumbs , salt, and pepper. Mix everything and transfer onto a baking tray lined with baking parchment . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 20 minutes.
When the vegetables are almost cooked, prepare the arugula sauce. Pour the arugula and oil into a tall container and blend everything with an immersion blender until you get a smooth cream .
After the 20 minutes, take the vegetables out of the oven and heat the flatbread in a hot pan, flipping it on both sides . Place the squaquerone
and spread it only on half of the flatbread . Place a tablespoon of arugula sauce and a quarter of the grilled vegetables on top.
Fold to close the flatbread , transfer it to a cutting board , cut it in half, and serve your flatbread with grilled vegetables still hot .
It is recommended to consume the flatbread with grilled vegetables immediately. Alternatively, it can be stored in the refrigerator for one day. The vegetables can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days.
You can use vegetables according to the season; for example, artichokes or asparagus.
For an ethnic touch, add curry, paprika or a bit of turmeric to the breadcrumbs!
