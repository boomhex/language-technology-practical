Jam swirls are delicious homemade treats: they are very simple to make! Delightful swirls of flavor made with a special steaming process that makes the dough more elastic and soft compared to traditional swirls . For the filling, we opted for plum jam, characterized by a delicate sweetness that evokes summer flavors. From now on, you'll have one more idea, tasty and genuine, to brighten up the breakfast and snack time for the whole family!
To prepare the jam swirls, start with the sponge cake. In a bowl, pour the whole eggs and sugar . Beat well with electric whisks .
You should obtain a light and homogeneous batter . Then mix the flour and potato starch and, by sifting them, add them to the mixture .
Gently mix with a spatula to incorporate the dry ingredients . Pour the batter into a 12x16 inch baking tray lined with parchment paper, and level it well with a spatula . Bake in an oven set to 100% steam mode at 212°F for 12 minutes.
When the sponge cake is cooked , take it out of the oven and immediately flip it over , removing the parchment paper . Let it cool at room temperature.
When it is cool, spread the jam over the entire surface and roll it up tightly . Then, to tighten it better, help yourself by wrapping it in plastic wrap .
Tighten the ends well and place it on a tray . Let it chill in the fridge for 2 hours. After the necessary time has passed, remove it from the plastic wrap and cut slices about 1.2 inches thick . Your jam swirl is ready to be served .
The swirls can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days. You can freeze them after baking.
If you want to give an aromatic touch to the batter, you can enrich it with lemon zest or vanilla seeds.
