To prepare the tuna salad , start with the dressing: in a mixer put the basil leaves, mint and parsley, the peeled garlic clove, oil, a pinch of salt and blend everything . Flavor the Greek yogurt with this aromatic sauce .
Stir and keep in the fridge until ready to serve. Take the fennel, cut the base and then the stems, and slice it thinly . Take the avocado, cut it in half lengthwise and remove the stone.
Remove the avocado peel and cut it into small pieces . Cut the cherry tomatoes in 4 parts .
Pour all the ingredients in a bowl , add the corn and the tuna , salt, pepper and mix . Serve the tuna salad with the yogurt sauce.
The tuna salad can be kept in the refrigerator for one day, but keep in mind that the avocado tends to oxidize, therefore we recommend covering the bowl with plastic wrap.
You can also use lemon juice to flavor the yogurt.
