If you’re looking for a traditional Italian dessert that whisks you away to a cozy Tuscan kitchen, the Torta Mantovana is it.

To prepare the Mantovana cake, place the butter, softened at room temperature, and the sugar in a bowl . Beat the two ingredients with an electric mixer or with the whisk attachment of a stand mixer until you get a fluffy mixture. Now add the whole egg and keep working the mixture to incorporate it.
Then add the egg yolks, one at a time, waiting for the previous one to be absorbed before adding the next . To get a homogeneous mixture , it's important that the eggs are at room temperature; if the mixture starts to separate after adding the eggs, don't worry because with the addition of the flour, you'll achieve the right consistency. Sift the flour .
together with the baking powder and add the dry ingredients, all at once, to the mixture , continuing to beat with the mixer to combine all the ingredients well and obtain a fluffy and homogeneous mixture . Line a 10-inch cake pan with parchment paper (click here to see how to do it).
Chop the almonds into pieces with a knife ; pour the mixture into the cake pan and level it evenly with the back of a spoon .
Sprinkle the surface with chopped almonds until fully covered (13-14); bake in a preheated oven at 356°F for 30 minutes (if using a convection oven, 320°F for 20-25 minutes). Before removing it from the oven, do the toothpick test: if it's not cooked yet, continue baking by covering the surface with a sheet of aluminum foil and keep baking until the expected time is up. Remove from the oven, let it cool down , and serve your Mantovana cake! You can sprinkle it with powdered sugar or granulated sugar as you like!
Store the cake under a glass cover for 3-4 days.
The name of the Mantovana cake seems to be linked to Isabella d'Este, Marquess of Mantua, who during a trip to Rome, as a guest at the court of Pope Leo X, stopped in Florence at the Medici court. Here, as a thank you for the hospitality received, Isabella left the recipe for the cake, which was then named Mantovana in her honor, and from Florence, it spread throughout Tuscany, especially in Prato, where it became a specialty. The pastry shop Antonio Mattei in Prato, besides producing the homonymous biscuits, also prepares a famous Mantovana cake according to Pellegrino Artusi's recipe.
Having followed the whole process, it would be a real shame to make a mistake right at the end, wouldn't it? Pay attention to the baking: to keep it soft and moist inside, you should take the Mantovana cake out of the oven just when it's done, otherwise it might dry out too much.
