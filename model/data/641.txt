instructions:
To prepare the chocolate-filled pancakes, first break the chocolate bar into 8 equal pieces . Set them aside and meanwhile melt the butter and let it cool. In the meantime, separate the egg whites from the yolks into two different bowls . Beat the yolks with a whisk, and while continuing to mix, add the milk in a slow stream .
When it is well incorporated, add the now cool butter and continue beating with the whisk. Whip the mixture until it becomes light. Sift the flour and baking powder into the bowl , mix with the whisk to combine .
You should get a smooth, lump-free batter . Now whip the egg whites you set aside, gradually adding the sugar until they are white and frothy .
gently incorporate them into the egg mixture with movements from top to bottom to avoid deflating them .
Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat, preferably with a thick bottom, and if necessary, grease it with a little butter spread over the surface with the help of kitchen paper. Pour 2 tablespoons of batter into the center of the pan , there will be no need to spread it. Place the piece of chocolate in the middle and cover with another tablespoon of batter .
When bubbles begin to appear on the surface , flip the pancake using a spatula . Let the other side brown as well and in a few minutes, it will be ready. Repeat this operation for the others, you will get 8 pancakes. Decorate with raspberries and semi-whipped cream .
We recommend consuming the pancakes as soon as they're ready, but if you prefer, you can store them in the fridge for a day and warm them up before serving.

Use pieces of chocolate that are not too thick. If your bar has rather large cubes, we recommend coarsely chopping the chocolate. You can use the type of chocolate you prefer: dark, white, or milk!
