Fregola with shrimp—such a classic in Sardinian cooking! If you’re all about that sea and land flavor combo, this dish is for you. Seriously, it shows off Sardinia’s love for seafood and its unique pasta, known as fregola or frègula. These little toasted semolina balls offer a tender bite, kind of like a mix between couscous and regular pasta. Really really good.
In Sardinia, fregola is usually in seafood stews, but here’s the twist: it’s cooked risotto-style. Slowly simmering it with shrimp shell broth, it absorbs that rich, moist flavor, capturing the ocean’s essence in each bite. And the sauce? What really makes this dish stand out is the final touch—creamy, cool stracciatella cheese . Added just before serving, it melts slightly, creating a silky, soft layer over everything.
And look, regional Italian cuisine always has surprises. The hint of licorice here is one of those twists that’s just so so good. Not exactly a licorice dessert , but that little dash of licorice powder gives it a subtle anise-flavored aroma. Pretty much feels Mediterranean. Sardinian chefs love experimenting, and touches like this keep things exciting while staying true to their roots.
Now, top it off with fresh, raw red shrimp. It's a burst of sweet, ocean flavor that pops against the creamy stracciatella recipe base. And here's the thing: in Sardinia, some versions might add clams or mussels. Which is great. But this combo of shrimp and stracciatella? It’s something special. Italian cheese enthusiasts will totally dig how the stracciatella melts into the fregola, giving a texture that’s extra creamy and a bit luxurious.
This is the kind of seafood pasta you’d find in a seaside spot in Cagliari. And modern and a bit gourmet—but deeply traditional. I mean, if you love fregola with shrimp , this dish really really shows why Sardinian food is cherished in Italian cuisine. It’s a taste of the Mediterranean that’s innovative yet steeped in heritage, no question.
