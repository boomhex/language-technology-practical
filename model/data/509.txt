instructions:
To prepare basmati with vegetable caponata, first prepare the vegetables: peel the red onions and slice them in julienne , then cut the eggplants into slices 3/4 inch thick and cube them .
Peel the peppers with a vegetable peeler , then remove seeds and inner filaments . Cut the peppers first into strips and then into pieces about 1/2 inch .
Also peel the celery stalks and cube them . Finally, halve the cherry tomatoes .
Heat the seed oil to a temperature of 356°F and fry a few eggplants at a time for about 3-4 minutes . Drain the eggplants on paper towels and set aside. Put the pine nuts in a preheated pan and toast them over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often. When they are colored, turn off the heat and set aside .
Proceed to the preparation of the caponata: heat a generous amount of oil in a large saucepan, then add the onions and cook over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add the peppers and celery and sauté for 5 minutes.
At this point, add the cherry tomatoes and tomato paste and continue cooking for another 5 minutes, then pour in the vinegar .
Also season with sugar and salt . Let the vinegar evaporate, then add the eggplants and continue to cook for another 10 minutes.
Shortly before the end of cooking, add the chopped olives , desalted capers , and toasted pine nuts .
Also add the raisins, which you have previously soaked . Once cooking is complete, flavor with basil by tearing the leaves with your hands and let it cool. In the meantime, cook the basmati rice in boiling salted water for the time indicated on the package.
Drain the rice and transfer it to a large bowl, then let it cool . Meanwhile, chop the anchovy fillets and add them to the now cooled caponata .
Combine the caponata with the warm rice and mix well . Serve your basmati with vegetable caponata garnished with fresh basil leaves !
Basmati with vegetable caponata can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, in an airtight container.
You can soak the raisins in Marsala and add them to the pan with the vinegar, so that the alcohol evaporates.
