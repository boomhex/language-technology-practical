To prepare the vegetable flatbreads and stuffed zucchini flowers, start with the dough . Pour the flour and the yeast into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a hook; turn it on to medium speed. After about 30 seconds, slowly pour in half of the water , then incorporate the salt .
and continue to pour the water , this way the salt will dissolve completely. Let the dough work until it clings to the hook . Then detach the dough and work it for about 1 minute on the work surface. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rise at a temperature of 80-82°F for about 2 hours or until the mixture has doubled in volume.
Meanwhile, clean the vegetables: remove the stem from the pepper and shake it to release the seeds, then cut it into pieces about 1-2 inches large . Trim the zucchini and divide it into 4 to obtain triangles about 1/2 inch large . Finally, peel the onion and, while whole, cut it into slices about 1/2 inch thick .
Separate the onion rings ; heat a drizzle of oil in a pan, then add the vegetables . Sauté over high heat for 1-2 minutes, seasoning with salt and tossing often to avoid burning . Transfer to a bowl and let cool slightly.
As soon as the dough has risen , transfer it to a lightly floured surface and roll it out with a rolling pin. You should create a rectangle 6 inches high and 20 inches long . From this, cut rectangles about 3 inches wide ,
you should get 6 . Transfer them to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Garnish each rectangle with some of the sautéed vegetables and bake in a preheated static oven at 430°F for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, work the ricotta with a spatula and transfer it to a piping bag .
Then proceed with cleaning the zucchini flowers: remove the stem, the peduncles at the base of the flower , and the pistil inside . Fill the flowers with the ricotta ,
and an oil-packed anchovy . Then cut the mozzarella into 4 large cubes and place one in each flower .
Drizzle some oil over the flowers and sprinkle them with a pinch of breadcrumbs and a grating of pecorino cheese .
After 15 minutes, remove the flatbreads from the oven and place the zucchini flowers on top . Cook for another 5 minutes, then turn on the grill until the flatbreads are well golden. Remove from the oven , sprinkle with a pinch of black pepper, a drizzle of oil, and enjoy them piping hot!
