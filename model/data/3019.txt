To prepare the pea fritters with yogurt sauce, start by cleaning the scallion: remove the green part of the stem , the roots, and the outermost tough layer. Then cut it into thin slices . In a pan, heat a little oil and add the scallion ,
add a peeled and whole garlic clove and sauté over low heat, stirring occasionally to avoid burning. When the scallion has softened, add the peas to the pan , add salt and pepper
then cover with a lid . Continue cooking for about 15-20 minutes. During cooking, you can add some water to prevent the peas from drying out too much . Once cooked , remove the garlic clove
drain the peas in a colander collecting the cooking water in a small bowl . Take half of the peas and place them in the blender and blend them together with the cooking water
until you get a thick and homogeneous cream . Set it aside in a small bowl and start preparing the batter: chop the chives . In a bowl, start working the egg with a whisk
to beat it , then add the yogurt and mix to combine the ingredients; separately in a bowl, pour the flour together with the baking soda
and then add them to the egg mixture, taking care to sift them through a sieve . Season with grated cheese and mix the ingredients thoroughly with a whisk .
pour the milk and continue mixing to obtain a smooth, lump-free mixture, also add the pea puree . If needed, adjust the salt and pepper, mix, and add the whole peas
and season with half of the chopped chives . Set the mixture aside and also prepare the yogurt sauce: in a bowl, pour the Greek yogurt and add the milk .
Mix the ingredients with a whisk and finish by flavoring with the remaining half of the chopped chives . In a pan, heat the seed oil for frying (you should not deep fry, the fritters should float but not be completely submerged) and pour a spoonful of batter to form the fritters . For optimal frying, the oil should have a temperature of 356°F, to best monitor the cooking, it is recommended to use a food thermometer.
Turn the fritters after a couple of minutes to brown them on the other side , then drain them with a slotted spoon onto a tray lined with absorbent paper to drain and blot the excess oil . Serve your pea fritters, preferably hot, accompanied by yogurt sauce !
Cooked pea fritters can be stored in the fridge for up to 1 day covered with plastic wrap; slightly heat them before serving. The yogurt sauce can be stored in the fridge for up to 1-2 days in a bowl covered with plastic wrap. Freezing is not recommended.
