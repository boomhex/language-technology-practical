instructions:
To prepare the Russian garden salad, start by taking the florets of cauliflower and broccoli, peel carrot and onion, wash the potatoes. Steam the vegetables, they should remain firm. Then let them cool down slightly and cut them into rather large cubes. Cut and add the cooked salami to the vegetables. Adjust the vegetables with salt. Prepare the mayonnaise by working the egg with an electric mixer (or by hand very quickly and vigorously) together with the lemon juice, emulsify and then pour in the seed oil in a thin stream to control the consistency gradually. Once the optimal consistency is reached, also add the teaspoon of mustard. Dress the vegetables with the mayonnaise and enjoy your Russian garden salad!
The Russian garden salad keeps in the refrigerator for about 3 days in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
Enjoy the Russian garden salad all year round, varying the vegetables according to seasonal availability.
