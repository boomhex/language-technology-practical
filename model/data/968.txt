instructions:
To prepare condensed milk, ensure the jars are well cleaned and the lids are new. Pour the milk into a saucepan , add the sugar , and stir .
The milk should continuously simmer , so adjust the flame to ensure it's not too strong. If foam forms on the surface, remove it . Let it cook for an hour and a half, stirring briefly every 10-15 minutes .
After the cooking time, you'll notice the color has changed, and the milk will be thicker . At this point, turn off the heat and pour it, while still hot, into the well-cleaned jars . Close them immediately ; this will create a vacuum seal. Let them cool first at room temperature, then transfer them to the fridge. You'll achieve the ideal consistency after 24 hours.
Once the vacuum seal is created, you can store it in the refrigerator for 2 weeks. Once opened, we recommend consuming it within 5 days and always keeping it in the fridge.
It can be used in all recipes requiring condensed milk as an ingredient or to sweeten coffee or tea.
• Can brown sugar be used?
Instead of granulated sugar, brown sugar can be used, but the result will be different. • Can semi-skimmed milk be used?
In this case, we recommend using whole milk.
• Can long-life milk be used? No problem, as long as it's whole milk.
