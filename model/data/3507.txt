To prepare the strawberry and white chocolate muffins, start by preheating the oven to 350°F; then wash the strawberries and cut them into small pieces . With the help of a knife, also reduce the white chocolate into small pieces , or you can use ready-made white chocolate chips. In a bowl, place the room-temperature butter and add the sugar; with an electric whisk, mix the ingredients well until the mixture becomes creamy .
Add the 3 eggs one at a time , still working with the whisk, and the milk slowly . Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, the seeds of a vanilla pod, and a pinch of salt, and incorporate everything into the mixture ,
mixing well with a wooden spoon until you get a smooth, lump-free batter . Then incorporate the white chocolate and the strawberry pieces .
Focus on preparing the crunchy topping: in a bowl, place the cold butter from the refrigerator in small pieces, brown sugar, and flour and mix the mixture coarsely with a wooden spoon or with your fingers to obtain crumbles (like a crumble) . Fill 14 muffin molds lined with paper liners with the batter up to half a centimeter from the edge . Then cover the muffins with the crumbles and bake them at 350°F for about 35/40 minutes (do the toothpick test to check their cooking). When the strawberry and white chocolate muffins are golden, take them out of the oven and let them cool before enjoying.
