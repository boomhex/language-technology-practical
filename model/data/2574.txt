If you're looking for something new, try the frittata al verde . It's like a little twist on a classic Italian dish. And here's the deal: you bake it in the oven instead of using the stovetop. Pretty simple. This not only keeps you from flipping disasters, but it also gives you a fluffier texture. Seriously good.
The base is loaded with sautéed spinach—so fresh and green—adding a tender bite that reminds you of a spring garden on your plate. Plus, chunks of salmon filet add a nice moist richness. You know? Toma piemontese cheese melts in perfectly, bringing a gentle, creamy flavor that ties it all together. It's way better than a plain frittata. And the thing is, it’s not just for breakfast— frittata con spinaci works for lunch or even a light dinner. Versatile, right?
What really sets this frittata gourmet apart is the salsa allo zafferano served on the side. And look, this saffron-infused cheese sauce is super silky—like, really really silky—and adds a pop of golden color that looks amazing on the plate. But it's not just for show. Its delicate flavor enhances the taste of the salmone affumicato , giving the whole dish that extra something special.
In northern Italy, using local cheeses like toma in frittatas is a beloved tradition. So this version embraces that, making it a true frittata con formaggio toma . For sure. The oven-baked method keeps it nice and fluffy, and you don’t have to stress about flipping it. Pair it with a fresh salad or some crusty bread, and you’ve got a meal that’s easy, good for you, and feels kinda elegant—like something you’d find in a cozy trattoria. This dish really shows how Italian food can be comforting and a little bit fancy, just by changing up a few simple things. Enjoy this tasty taste of Italy at home, and discover how a few tweaks can make a big difference in flavor and presentation. So, so good.
To make the green omelette with salmon, toma, and saffron sauce, start by cutting the salmon fillet into cubes , do the same with the toma . Wash the spinach under running water and drain them,
place them in a pan with a drizzle of olive oil and a garlic clove and let them wilt over high heat for 10-15 minutes until they are soft and let them cool down . In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper
add the cooked spinach , blend the mixture with an immersion blender to obtain a homogeneous mixture , incorporate the salmon cubes leaving one tablespoon aside,
the toma cubes also take aside a tablespoon and flavor with fresh thyme leaves . Line a 9-inch diameter pan with parchment paper ,
pour the egg mixture inside , distribute the salmon and the toma you set aside on top.
Once finished , bake the omelette in a static oven at 356°F for 50 minutes (or in a convection oven at 320°F for 40 minutes). Check the cooking by inserting a toothpick into the omelette, if it comes out dry, you can remove it from the oven. While the omelette is baking, prepare the saffron sauce: heat the oil in a pan, add the chopped onion add the vegetable broth and stew for at least 10 minutes,
then add the toma in pieces and continue cooking to melt it. When the cheese has completely melted, add pink peppercorns, saffron powder and stir with a spatula to mix it into the sauce and obtain a uniform color .
Transfer the sauce to a tall glass and blend it with an immersion blender to make it smooth. Transfer the sauce to a small bowl and add more pink peppercorns to taste . Meanwhile, the omelette will be cooked, remove it from the oven let it cool slightly and then serve it with the sauce.
Store the green omelette with salmon, toma, and saffron sauce in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 2 days. It is possible to freeze the omelette without sauce if you used fresh ingredients.
As an alternative to spinach, you can use other seasonal vegetables like broccoli, green beans, or peas. If you love bold flavors, you can use taleggio cheese instead of toma.
