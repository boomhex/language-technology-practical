To prepare homemade rice milk, pour the rice into a pot , add the cold water , and bring to a boil. Once it reaches boiling point, lower the heat and continue to cook for 40 minutes over low heat .
After the cooking time has elapsed, turn off the heat and let it cool for at least 20 minutes . At this point, transfer the rice and its cooking water into a pitcher and blend with an immersion mixer . If the mixture is too thick, dilute it by gradually adding water ; we added about 1 2/3 cups of water.
Once the desired consistency is reached , strain everything with a fine-mesh strainer . Your homemade rice milk is ready to be enjoyed !
Homemade rice milk can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.
If you wish, you can flavor your homemade rice milk with a vanilla bean, a cinnamon stick, or some citrus zest by adding them directly during cooking.
