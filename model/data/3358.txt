Spianatine with Asiago cream—sounds fancy, right? Well, it's one of those Italian flatbread recipes that really shows off the good stuff from the Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia regions. These tender flatbreads, called spianatine, bake until they’re super crispy on the edges. Honestly, they make the perfect base for all sorts of toppings.
Here's the thing: the real star is the creamy Asiago cheese spread . Made with cheese right from the Asiago plateau—really fresh—it gives you a smooth, moist bite every time. Grilled radicchio adds a hint of bitterness and a splash of color, while the pancetta gets fried until it’s golden and crunchy. So you end up with a mix that's super tasty—creamy, bitter, and savory flavors all in one. Folks in northern Italy love serving these as a radicchio and pancetta topping during casual gatherings or at the holiday table.
And look, while these spianatine might seem a tad fancy, they’re really just classic Italian finger food recipes with a northern twist. What’s special? It’s how everything balances out. Every bite gives you that creamy Asiago, some slightly tangy radicchio, and those crispy pancetta bits. It’s not just about the flavors; textures play a big role too: the flatbread is tender inside, the spread is smooth, and the toppings are both crunchy and moist. Which is great.
This snack pairs perfectly as a radicchio and pancetta appetizer with drinks. Also, it’s awesome for sharing with friends at the table. Some folks add a bit of honey or chopped walnuts for a sweet twist, or they swap the radicchio for arugula if less bitterness is preferred. These tweaks make spianatine one of those easy Italian flatbread ideas you can really have fun with. Once you try it, you’ll see why homemade spianatine with Asiago cheese has such a fan base in northeastern Italy. It’s all about fresh, regional ingredients, and how they come together in every bite—making it a really satisfying experience. Seriously good.
To assemble the flatbreads with Asiago cream, radicchio, and bacon, start by preparing the Asiago cream: cut the cheese into cubes , then in a heavy-bottomed saucepan (or using a double boiler), melt the pat of butter, add the milk and the Asiago cut into small cubes . Heat over low heat, continuously stirring with a spoon until the cheese has completely melted. If the mixture is too liquid, add a teaspoon of flour. The result should be a thick sauce; finally, pepper to taste.
Cut the bacon into cubes, place them in a non-stick pan, and brown them until they are golden and crispy. When ready, transfer them to a cutting board and chop them into small crumbs with the help of a sharp knife. Wash the radicchio head thoroughly and cut it in half lengthwise, season with a little oil, salt, and pepper, and let it rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a grill. Place the radicchio and cook for a few minutes on each side , until it is well grilled, then cut it into strips about 0.75 inches wide . Then start assembling the snacks by placing two or three strips of grilled radicchio on each "La Bottega di Olivia & Marino" flatbread, drizzle a teaspoon of Asiago cream on top, and garnish with the crispy bacon crumbs.
