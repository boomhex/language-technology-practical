Penne with Maitó sauce is a real gem from the gorgeous seaside town of Forte Dei Marmi in Tuscany. This dish? It is about those simple, rich flavors that just scream local, family-style goodness. When you first dig in, the velvety tomato sauce really hits you, with Normandy butter and fresh basil creating this creamy and silky vibe. Really nice. This butter? It's a special touch you don't see in other penne pasta recipes . The dish is named after the grandma of the original restaurant owners, who put a lot of love into it.
Thing is, even though it looks simple, it’s got this quiet confidence that locals in Tuscany know so well. And it’s not just locals—it’s folks from all over Italy and even beyond, coming to taste this dish. And using fresh ingredients? Makes all the difference.

People in Forte Dei Marmi keep it real, even celebrities keep coming back for more.
The texture is spot on—not heavy, never gummy—with flavors that are both bright and comforting. If you love easy penne recipes or crave something straightforward and honest, this dish is it.
