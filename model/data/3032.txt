Granita al caffè, straight from sunny Sicily , is why coffee granita becomes a go-to summer treat across Italy. Really, this isn’t just iced coffee—each spoonful of Italian coffee granita hits you with an icy, refreshing chill and a bold, deep coffee kick that just feels perfect on a hot day. And look, what makes this treat stand out is its simplicity; you get all the sweet satisfaction of dessert without feeling stuffed. Folks in Sicily have loved this forever, and there’s something super inviting about how they serve it—sometimes with a soft brioche bun or a twist with those little French almond madeleines. That combo? The tender crumb of the madeleine next to the crisp, almost crunchy ice of the granita makes for a pretty awesome bite.
Over in Sicily, this granita al caffè recipe is a summer staple, and I gotta say, it’s not hard to see why. People there, they know how to stay cool and enjoy good food at the same time. Really. This coffee granita dessert pops up everywhere when it’s hot. The strong, slightly bitter coffee flavor hits in every bite, but it’s never too much—thanks to the chilly texture and just the right amount of sugar. It’s that kind of frozen coffee treat that feels fancy but is actually super easy to make at home—no fancy gadgets, just old-school stirring and freezing, like Sicilians have done forever. When you add a few mini almond madeleines on the side, the flavors just click: the moist almond cake brings out a whole new side of the Sicilian coffee granita , softening the coffee's sharpness with its gentle, woody sweetness. For sure, this pairing not only enhances the taste but gives you that mix of simple and stylish. Whether you’re chilling after lunch or just need something cool and light to end the day, this coffee granita is the way to go. It’s a really good journey through flavors, transporting you straight to the beautiful streets of Sicily.
To prepare the mini madeleines, start by putting the almond flour in a bowl . Add the sifted all-purpose flour and the sugar .
Add the salt , the sifted baking powder , and the eggs .
Continue by adding the honey and the previously melted butter , then mix well with a hand whisk .
Finally, add the almond flavoring . Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least two hours or, if you can, overnight . Pour the mixture into a piping bag and then take a silicone mini madeleine mold with the classic shell shapes, and fill all the molds . If you don't have a silicone mold, you can also use a metal mold and pour the batter with a teaspoon.
Transfer the mold onto a baking sheet and bake in a static oven at 375°F for about 12 minutes, or if using a convection oven, bake at 340°F for 6-7 minutes ; if using a metal mold, bake at 355°F until they turn golden. Once they have cooled a bit, gently remove them from the mold and let them cool on a rack . Store them under a glass dome or in a container to keep their fragrance.
To prepare the coffee granita, start by making the coffee. To get excellent coffee, fill the boiler of your coffee maker with cold, low-lime water, being careful not to exceed the safety valve (otherwise, you'll get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee, forming a mound that you'll level by tapping the filter on the table with firm movements . Do not press with a teaspoon, nor make holes on the surface .
Close the coffee maker very tightly so that the coffee doesn't spill out from the sides while it rises, and place it on a low and steady flame to obtain full-bodied coffee. As the coffee rises, a dense froth will form : we recommend not letting the coffee boil too long to maintain its sweetness and aroma. Your coffee is ready: before using it, stir it directly in the moka pot with a teaspoon to make the coffee more homogeneous .
Now, proceed with the granita: in a non-stick saucepan, pour the sugar and add the water . After cutting a vanilla pod in half, empty it and add it to the water and sugar along with its seeds and bring to a boil.
Then add the freshly made coffee and transfer the mixture into a low and wide container to speed up the freezing process. Let it cool, remove the vanilla pod, and cover the container with a layer of plastic wrap. Place in the freezer for at least 15-20 minutes. When the mixture has solidified, break the ice crystals with the tines of a fork or a whisk every 10-15 minutes, repeating the operation 2-3 times . Each time, the time will decrease because the preparation is already cold, so it will take less time to solidify the mixture. This operation must be carried out gently so as not to alter the color of the granita. Indeed, if it incorporates too much air, it risks turning beige rather than remaining dark brown. In the meantime, whip the fresh liquid cream and powdered sugar with an electric mixer to garnish the granita.
Stir the granita one last time, keeping in mind that the more you break the crystals, the finer they will become. Now compose the granita: with a spoon, pour the coffee granita into a small glass or cup , decorate with a dollop of whipped cream and a coffee bean . Your coffee granita is ready to be served and accompanied by the mini madeleines!
You can store the coffee granita in the freezer and the mini madeleines in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap at room temperature for up to a week.
