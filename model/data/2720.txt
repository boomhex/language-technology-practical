instructions:
To make broccoli pesto, wash the broccoli, divide the florets from the central stem and blanch them for 5 minutes (2-3),
then drain them and place them in a bowl full of ice water to cool them and keep the color vibrant. Once the broccoli have cooled, drain them from the ice water and dry them with a paper towel .
Transfer the broccoli to the blender , add the basil leaves , the peeled almonds ,
the pine nuts , the grated Grana Padano DOP , and half of the extra virgin olive oil .
Blend all the ingredients and slowly add the remaining oil , if the mixture turns out too dry, add more oil. The pesto should be creamy , once ready you can use it to season the pasta.
Store the broccoli pesto in the refrigerator for a couple of days covered with plastic wrap, or you can freeze it.
Alternatively to almonds and pine nuts, you can use walnuts, and if you love bold flavors, replace the Parmesan with pecorino.
