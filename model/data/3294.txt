Girelle alla sardella is a standout from Calabria, a region known for its bold and bright flavors. These rolls start with soft bread dough. Really good stuff. But the real magic? The spicy spread of sardella swirled inside. Sardella, sometimes called rosamarina or neonata, is a traditional condiment made from baby fish known as bianchetti. In Calabria, locals mix it with sea salt and either sweet or hot red pepper, giving it a distinctive tangy kick and a beautiful reddish hue. And look, when you slice into a fresh batch of girelle alla sardella , you're greeted with a swirl of moist, slightly spicy filling that elevates every bite. Really, it's so so good, especially if you enjoy Calabrian sardella rolls with their rustic charm and bold taste. You'll find them at family gatherings, tucked into bread baskets as appetizers, or simply paired with a glass of wine for a seriously good snack.
Calabrians excel at transforming simple ingredients into memorable dishes. No question. These sardella rolls are a prime example. Each bite offers a classic blend of sea and spice, a nod to the generations who've perfected this recipe. Some variations include extras like chopped olives or onions, but the highlight remains the rich, crispy sardella spread. The rolls stay tender inside, while the edges might turn a golden brown in the oven—so pretty—enhancing their appeal. These spicy sardella rolls offer a true taste of southern Italy, distinct from the Italian appetizers commonly found in the north. If you're exploring traditional Calabrian recipes or eager to try something with a deep history and robust flavor, girelle alla sardella won't disappoint. They're salty, a bit spicy, and uniquely tied to this part of Italy. Pretty much a must-try. With a blend of sea-inspired flavors and spicy notes, these rolls capture the heart of Calabria, inviting you to enjoy a little slice of Italian heritage in every bite.
To prepare the sardella swirls, start with the bread dough: dissolve the yeast in a little lukewarm water, along with a teaspoon of malt (or sugar) and add it to the two flours that you will have sifted together in a bowl or on a pastry board . In the remaining lukewarm water, dissolve the salt, add the oil, and pour the obtained liquid over the flour in a thin stream, stirring with broad and quick movements, until finished . Knead for about ten minutes, until you get a compact, smooth, and elastic dough , which you will place in a floured bowl, covered with plastic wrap, and let rise for about two hours in a closed, off oven.

Once the dough has doubled in size, transfer it to a floured pastry board and roll it out evenly to form a circle about 0.4 inches thick . Prick the surface with the tines of a fork .
Now prepare the filling: put the sardella in a bowl and add the oil, stirring with a fork . Spread the sardella over the surface of the dough disc, leaving a border of about 0.2 inches and roll it up, starting from the bottom to the top .
Before sealing it, seal the roll by brushing water along the edge . Now cut the roll into pieces about 0.8 inches wide and place the obtained swirls on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper . Bake them at 392°F in a static oven for 20-25 minutes and serve your sardella swirls still warm!
Store the swirls in the refrigerator in a closed container with a lid for up to 2-3 days, and before eating, reheat them in the oven!
You can add 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce to the sardella filling to get a filling that will make the swirls moister inside.
