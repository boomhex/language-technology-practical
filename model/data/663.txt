instructions:
In the bowl of a mixer, add the previously rinsed and drained chickpeas , chickpea flour , oil , salt, and pepper.
Add the chili pepper, turmeric , cumin , and cornstarch .
Close everything up and blend thoroughly . At first, the mixture will seem very dry and powdery, but as you continue blending, it will thicken and become malleable. You can optionally add a bit more oil or a tablespoon of water if it is too dense. Prepare the batter: in a bowl, pour flour and water. Mix well with a fork and season with salt .
Now take pieces of dough weighing about 4.2 oz and form a ball , then flatten it between your hands to shape it into a cutlet. Pass it first in the batter and then in the breadcrumbs .
Fry each cutlet in a pan with about 0.5 inch of oil until golden brown. It will take 2-3 minutes per side; use a spatula to turn it over and then drain it on absorbent paper . Continue this way until they are all cooked and serve your chickpea cutlets with a side of vegetables .
You can store the cutlets in the fridge for 1-2 days.
If you prefer, you can freeze the cutlets before cooking.
It is advisable not to substitute chickpea flour, but if you absolutely cannot find it, try increasing the amount of cornstarch, adjusting based on the dough's consistency. If it is still too moist, adjust the consistency by adding breadcrumbs.
If you are not following a vegan diet, you can replace the batter with a beaten egg for a traditional breading.
If you want to eliminate gluten from this recipe, make the batter with potato starch or rice flour.
You can season the dough with spices and herbs of your choice. Remember that turmeric helps give color.
The cutlets can also be baked in the oven at 392°F for 18 minutes.
You can use the chickpea water (aquafaba) to make an accompanying mayonnaise.
