instructions:
To prepare the pâte à bombe, pour the sugar and water into a saucepan. Start cooking the syrup over low heat, and from time to time, check the temperature using a kitchen thermometer; it should reach 250°F. When it reaches 239°F , pour the yolks into a bowl.
Start whisking them with an electric mixer , and as soon as the syrup reaches 250°F , slowly pour it into the yolks, keeping the mixer running at low speed .
Continue to whisk, slightly increasing the mixer speed , until the mixture becomes light, fluffy, and foamy . Continue working until it returns to room temperature. The pâte à bombe is ready to be used in many recipes .
It is preferable to use the preparation within the day.
We recommend using very fresh eggs. If you prefer a more intense color, you can use golden yolk eggs. Instead of a bowl and mixer, you can also use a stand mixer for convenience. Pay close attention to the syrup's temperature. As soon as it reaches 244°F, get ready to pour it, as it will reach the exact temperature very quickly, even just from the heat of the saucepan. This way, you won't risk crystallizing the syrup or exceeding the desired temperature.
