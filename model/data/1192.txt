instructions:
To prepare the potato towers with salmon and provola, start by washing and drying the potatoes . Thinly slice them using a mandoline , or alternatively, cut with a knife, obtaining slices about 1/8 inch thick .
Place the slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush the surface with a bit of oil . Add a pinch of salt and pepper and bake in a static oven, preheated at 350°F, for about 15 minutes .
Meanwhile, slice the provola and cut pieces slightly smaller than the potato slices and then do the same with the salmon . For each tower, you'll need 3 potato slices, 20 pieces of provola, and 10 salmon slices. Now you have everything you need, and you can assemble your towers in this order. On the first potato slice, place the salmon first ,
then the provola and again potatoes , salmon, and provola .
and close with the last slice . The first one is ready, sprinkle the surface with some fresh thyme leaves , and continue this way with all the others. Your potato towers with salmon and provola are ready, enjoy your aperitif .
It is recommended to consume the potato towers with salmon and provola in a short time because the ingredients may darken and lose their texture.
Freezing is not recommended.
Add a touch of creaminess to your potato towers with salmon and provola by adding a thin layer of fresh spreadable cheese! Instead of pepper, sprinkle the potatoes with a bit of smoked paprika!
