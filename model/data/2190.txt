instructions:
To prepare the roast leg of lamb, start by handling the meat. First, try to free the end part of the bone from the meat so that it will not curl during cooking. Then remove the excess fat on the entire leg until it is almost completely cleaned .
At this point, salt , pepper, and massage the meat with your hands . Then transfer it into a lightly greased baking dish and sprinkle the entire surface with a drizzle of oil .
Cover with the sprigs of rosemary and thyme . Bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 2 hours, placing it on the lower rack of the oven, turning the leg halfway through cooking . Once it is well browned and perfectly cooked on both sides , serve your leg of lamb still steaming!
Once cooked, the roast leg of lamb can be stored for a maximum of 2 days in the refrigerator!
Is your leg of lamb not the same size as ours? Cooking times may vary, you might need to slightly extend the time if your leg is larger. For more precision, using a probe, you will be able to measure the right internal temperature of the leg; in fact, for the inside to be pink just right, it must be 140°F!
Enrich this dish with your favorite side: artichokes, spinach, or classic roasted potatoes!
