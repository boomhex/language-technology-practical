instructions:
To prepare the stuffed potatoes with ham and cheese, start by selecting 6 potatoes of similar size, so they will cook at the same time . Wrap each one in a sheet of aluminum foil and place them spaced apart on a baking tray. Bake in a static oven, preheated to 400°F, for about 80 minutes .
Meanwhile, cut the cooked ham and the fontina cheese with the rind removed, both into cubes of about 1 cm . Finally, chop the parsley .
When the necessary time has passed, check if the potatoes are cooked with the help of a skewer: if it reaches the center easily, they are considered cooked. Remove the foil then cut the top part of the potatoes so that one part is larger than the other .
Scoop them out with a spoon, being careful not to pierce the larger part as it will serve as a shell . Place the scooped-out part in a bowl . Gradually arrange the potato shells in a baking dish .
Add the ham, fontina cheese , salt, pepper, chopped parsley , and a drizzle of oil to the potato pulp .
Mix well and before stuffing the potatoes, salt them inside . Then fill them one at a time .
Here is the first one ready, repeat for all the others so they will be ready to be gratinated in a hot oven at 400°F, in grill mode, placed on the upper part of the oven for 5-7 minutes . Your stuffed potatoes with ham and cheese are ready to be enjoyed hot .
If you wish, you can store your stuffed potatoes with ham and cheese for a maximum of 2-3 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
You can also use other types of cheese as you like, preferably not fresh ones like mozzarella or similar. In this case, it's advisable to drain the cubes for at least an hour.
