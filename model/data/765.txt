Salt, pepper, and deglaze with brandy . Once the potatoes are nicely golden , serve them with the pork chops .
We recommend consuming the pork chops immediately. However, you can store the potato and onion side dish in the refrigerator for a couple of days. We do not recommend freezing.
We used new potatoes with thin skin, so it is not necessary to peel them.
