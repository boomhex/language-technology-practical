instructions:
Saffron gyoza are an appetizer that combines Japanese tradition with a touch of Italian flavor, creating a bridge between different culinary cultures and offering a unique and fascinating gastronomic experience. The heart of the gyoza is a tasty filling made from ground meat, leek, and cabbage. Ginger adds a spicy and aromatic note, while sake and soy sauce complete the picture with flavors typical of Japanese cuisine. The golden wrapper, thanks to the saffron, is thin and slightly crispy, enveloping this delicious filling and creating a contrast of textures that delights the palate. Whether you prepare them for a dinner with friends, a family evening, or a special romantic occasion, these dumplings will always amaze and delight your guests.
Have fun experimenting with other enticing versions of gyoza :

To prepare saffron gyoza, first, on a work surface, arrange the flour in a mound. Add the saffron , the water , and a pinch of salt to the center. Mix with a fork .
Knead until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough . Wrap it with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes .
In the meantime, prepare the filling. Finely chop the cabbage , remove the tougher parts of the leek , and cut it into rings .
In a pan, pour a drizzle of sesame oil, add the leek , the cabbage , add salt and pepper . Sauté for a few minutes.
In a bowl, place the ground meat, add the soy sauce , the sake , and the sesame oil .
Also add the ginger , adjust with salt and pepper , then add the sautéed cabbage and leek . Mix until all ingredients are well combined.
Roll out the dough , with a rolling pin or pasta machine, until you obtain a thin layer about 1/16 inch (2-3 mm) thick. Use a round cutter to create discs . Place a tablespoon of filling in the center of each disc .
Fold the discs in half and seal the edges well, creating the typical pleats of this format .
In a pan, heat the sesame oil well, place the gyoza in, and cook for a few minutes until the base becomes golden. Add the water , cover with a lid .
Cook over medium heat for about 5-6 minutes, until the water is completely evaporated . Plate and serve the saffron gyoza hot with soy sauce .
Saffron gyoza can be stored in the refrigerator, either raw or cooked, for up to 2 days. They can be frozen: place them on a tray, without overlapping, and put them in the freezer. Once frozen, transfer them to freezer bags. In this way, they can be stored for up to three months.
When sealing the gyoza, slightly moisten the edges of the dough with water to ensure an airtight closure, pressing the edges well to prevent the filling from escaping during cooking. The traditional pleating of the edges not only gives a characteristic appearance but also helps maintain the shape during cooking. If you want to experiment, you can vary the filling: try them with shrimp, chicken, or even vegetables for a vegetarian version. Add different spices like curry powder, paprika, or fresh herbs to give a personal touch.
