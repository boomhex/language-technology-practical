Round, fried, and inviting just by looking at them... fried pizzelle will entice everyone! Also known as montanare , they are crispy pizza dough discs and part of the culinary tradition of Campania. You can always find at least one small one in the cuoppo, accompanied by crocché, zeppoline, rice balls, and sciurilli fritters . And since pizza is an art, we preferred to rely on a Master baker of three generations: Franco Pepe, who worked the pizzelle dough for us in a traditional and almost "sacred" object: the madia, a large wooden container used for its excellent ability to maintain the right dough temperature. Of course, at home, you can use a simple glass bowl and still get delicious pizzelle for a tasty savory snack! You'll feel transported to the atmosphere of the alleys of early 1900s Naples, in one of those black-and-white films depicting scenes of popular life: "eat today and pay in eight days," repeated the pizzaiolo, preparing the fried pizza on the spot to deliver to passersby or neighborhood ladies lowering baskets from balconies. Now that the atmosphere is set, all you have to do is patiently start making your fried pizzelle! And to end lunch or dinner, enjoy a delicious sfogliatella !
To prepare fried pizzelle, start by making the dough. First, pour a bit of the indicated amount of room-temperature water into a small jug. Add the crumbled fresh yeast and stir with a teaspoon until completely dissolved . Let the yeast rest, and in the meantime, place about 30% of the flour on one side of the madia . The madia is a wooden container that can withstand the dough's temperature well and prevents it from sticking to the sides. If you don't have one, you can use a wooden container or a glass bowl. Then pour the water into the other half of the madia, avoiding pouring it directly onto the flour .
Next, add the salt to the water and dissolve it by gently stirring with your hands . Once you no longer feel any grains, start mixing in the flour .
Add a bit more flour and gradually mix it with the water in a circular motion using your hands. When you've added about 50% of the flour, incorporate the previously dissolved yeast into the dough . Continue adding a bit more flour
and keep kneading until you've incorporated all the flour. Kneading by hand allows you to better gauge the dough's consistency and determine if more flour is needed. At this point, continue working the dough within the madia, or bowl, for 10-15 minutes until smooth and homogeneous . Then let the dough rise inside the madia, gently covering it with a slightly damp, clean cloth . Let it rise in a spot protected from drafts or temperature fluctuations.
Let it rest for at least 4 hours at room temperature, away from drafts. After this time, take the dough and transfer it, using a dough scraper, to a lightly floured surface . Using the dough scraper, divide it into 50 g (1.7 oz) portions . With these quantities, you'll get about 25 portions.
With a bit of flour, fold each portion into a ball, placing the edges underneath and positioning them on a lightly floured tray (the folded edges should be in contact with the base) . Cover with a dry cloth this time and let rest for at least another 2 hours, always in a draft-free spot.
Meanwhile, prepare the sauce; transfer the San Marzano tomatoes to a glass bowl and tear them apart with your hands ; alternatively, you can use a fork. Then pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, add a previously crushed garlic clove , and let it sauté until golden; then remove it .
Add the tomatoes to the pan and season with salt ; then add the oregano and let it cook on low heat for at least half an hour, stirring often, until it thickens .
After 2 hours of rising, heat a large pan with peanut oil to a maximum temperature of 356°F (use a kitchen thermometer to check). Using a dough scraper, carefully lift one portion from the tray and transfer it to a lightly floured work surface. Use your fingertips to gently stretch your first pizzella (26-27).
Then, using the tip of the scraper, lightly poke the dough ; this way, it won't puff up too much during cooking. Once the oil reaches the indicated temperature, immerse the pizzella , pressing the center with a spoon to prevent it from puffing excessively and to create a central cavity that will later hold the sauce once cooked.
When golden brown, drain the pizzella with a slotted spoon and place it on a paper towel . Continue cooking the others similarly. Once cooked, you can dress them: pour a spoonful of tomato sauce into the center cavity of each pizzella
then sprinkle with grated cheese . Finish with fresh basil leaves and serve your pizzelle while still hot !
We recommend consuming fried pizzelle while still hot.
Alternatively, you can store the dough in the refrigerator for up to one day or freeze it before the second rise.
Fried pizzelle are delicious snacks; to make them even tastier, add some Gaeta olives, an anchovy fillet, or a sprinkle of grated salted ricotta!
The history of fried pizzelle (and fried pizza in general) is connected to Naples. This specialty was mainly sold in the "bassi," the small homes where the poorer families of the city lived who couldn't afford anything else. The nickname for fried pizzelle was indeed a ogge a otte , meaning "eat it today and pay in eight days," because pizzaioli often extended credit.
