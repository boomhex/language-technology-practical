Start working with the electric mixer and, while mixing, add the oil and the yogurt .
Finally, add the sifted powder mix , almond flour , salt, and baking soda .
Flavor with vanilla essence and mix well to combine everything. Pour the batter into 8 aluminum molds and bake in a static oven, preheated to 356°F, for about 25 minutes. Once cooled, unmold and sprinkle with powdered sugar your yogurt and banana muffins without eggs !
