So, if you're in the mood for something soft and rustic, you gotta try this easy potato schiacciata recipe from Tuscany. Seriously good stuff. It’s like a middle ground between focaccia and pizza—thicker than pizza, but not as puffy as classic focaccia. The name "schiacciata" actually comes from the whole pressing-the-dough-with-your-fingertips thing. And you know what? Those crispy edges with the tender and cloud-like inside—so so good.
This quick potato flatbread is all about those sliced potatoes and rosemary sprinkled on top. They add this really, really nice aroma and an earthy, fresh taste. It’s got that homemade vibe, no question. In Tuscany, the simple potato schiacciata is a hit when feeding a crowd. Really warm and fragrant. People just love serving it hot, straight from the oven, when it’s golden and the rosemary scent is everywhere. To be honest, it's just as tasty at room temperature. Seriously.
It's perfect as an appetizer, cut into squares, or even as a main dish with some cheeses or cured meats. And listen, the Italian potato flatbread keeps it real with the basics: good flour, potatoes, olive oil, yeast, and rosemary. Pressing the dough with your fingertips makes these dimples and creates a texture that's chewy but still moist and light. It's pretty simple.
Schiacciata is a great example of Tuscan home baking. And it’s straightforward—and really, it’s a star in any kitchen. Anyone who digs making bread will enjoy trying out a homemade potato flatbread like this, bringing a slice of Italy’s laid-back food scene right into your home. Super tasty.
