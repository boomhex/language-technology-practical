Risotto alla Milanese —I gotta say—is a dish folks in Lombardy are really proud of, especially with this cool vasocottura method. Basically, cooking it in a jar. You know, this technique locks in all the aromas and moist textures, making each bite burst with that super saffron flavor. Thing is, in this region, saffron isn’t just an ingredient—it’s the heart of the dish.
And the color? It is all golden and the rice, oh, so tender. And every spoonful smells amazing—thanks to the sealed jar. For sure, compared to regular stovetop risotto, this method lets you savor every bit, from the creamy rice to that subtle broth hint. Plus, it feels kinda special since not everyone’s tried a jarred risotto mix like this.
Many think saffron risotto means constant stirring, but with vasocottura, it’s the opposite. Just set it up and let the process work its magic. Pretty simple. This makes risotto in a jar perfect for meal prep or when you want something fancy without the fuss. The best part? The rice soaks up all that sweet and rich flavor, really really getting the most from the saffron and broth.
Even those who love more traditional homemade risotto appreciate how the tangy cheese flavor pops at the end. In Lombardy, some folks like to toss in a bit of bone marrow or beef broth—these flavors get even more intense when sealed in the jar. And look, if you’re craving that Italian rice dish with a modern twist, vasocottura offers a fresh take that’s true to its roots. It's seriously good. One of those recipes that show how easy and tasty a real saffron-infused rice dinner can be, impressing every time with its blend of tradition and innovation.
To make Milanese risotto in jar cooking, first prepare the Beef Broth : you will need about 230 grams (8 oz). Then put the saffron threads in a small bowl, add 60 grams (1/4 cup) of hot water, stir (1-2), and let it rest for 20 minutes. Peel and chop the onion: you will need 60 grams (1/2 cup) .
Transfer it to a glass bowl and add the butter . Place the bowl in the microwave and set it to 750 watts for 3 minutes. Pour the rice over the sautéed onion and stir .
Add the white wine to the rice and put the bowl back in the microwave for 2 minutes at 750 watts. Then pour in the liquid in which you have dissolved the saffron threads and the broth, stir , and adjust the salt, only if necessary.
Divide the rice prepared in this way, with all its broth, into 2 jars with a capacity of 500 ml (2 cups) . Clean the edges of the jars, close them , and seal them with the appropriate clips . Let the rice rest inside the jars for 15 minutes, so it can absorb some of the liquid. Set the microwave to 500 watts, insert a jar, and start cooking for 6 minutes. Remove from the microwave and let rest with the jar closed for 20 minutes.
During the resting time, the cooking will be completed, and the vacuum will form. Meanwhile, cook the other jar. Now the Milanese risotto in jar cooking is ready; to open the jar and remove the vacuum comfortably, just unclip and place the jar in the microwave, starting at 750 watts for about 3 minutes. The push of the internal steam will gently open the lid. Once opened, add the butter and grated cheese to the rice, stir, and serve your Milanese risotto in jar cooking hot !
The risotto can be stored for up to 3 days in the refrigerator, closed in the vacuum seal.

Do not open the jar immediately after removing it from the microwave as there is pressure inside; always let it rest for 15-20 minutes.
