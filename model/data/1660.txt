To make the vegetarian stuffed friggitelli, first wash and dry the friggitelli, cut them laterally to remove a small portion , and use a teaspoon to extract the seeds inside .
Wash and dry the tomato, then slice it first and then dice it . Drain the sun-dried tomatoes and cut them into small pieces .
In a large bowl, add the fresh tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes in oil , season with grated Parmesan cheese , breadcrumbs
and scent the mixture with coarsely chopped basil leaves . Finally, salt the filling and mix to combine the ingredients. Now place the friggitelli on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and fill the cavity with the filling, using a teaspoon to help .
Drizzle the friggitelli with oil and bake in a static oven preheated to 350°F for 20 minutes (if you prefer them very soft, you can bake them for a few more minutes). Once cooked, take the vegetarian stuffed friggitelli out of the oven , let them cool slightly, and then serve.
The friggitelli can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days, covered with plastic wrap. Freezing is not recommended.
Capers, olives, or artichokes in oil... there are countless tempting variations of this filling!
If you follow a vegetarian diet that excludes cheese made with animal rennet in addition to meat and fish, you can replace the ingredient with a similar cheese made with vegetable rennet.
