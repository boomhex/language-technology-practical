To prepare the potato nests with eggs, start by peeling the potatoes , then julienne them using a mandoline or grater and set aside. Meanwhile, heat the seed oil in a large pot, when it is hot, take a small double frying basket, which consists of two steel baskets (the large basket has a diameter of about 4.33 inches and the small one about 3.54 inches) that will give the potatoes a basket shape, and dip it in the hot oil to prevent the potatoes from sticking to the basket during cooking.
Place about 3.5 oz of julienne potatoes inside the larger basket and close it over the smaller basket with a light pressure . Dip the potatoes in the boiling oil and fry until golden brown,
then drain them and gently remove them from the tool where they are contained . Place the basket on a glass bowl to maintain the shape (8-9).
Continue the same way with the remaining potatoes . Now Hard Boiled Eggs , then cool them under a stream of cold water, peel them, and slice them .
Dress the lettuce with a vinaigrette made by whisking extra virgin olive oil with a few drops of lemon and salt. Make the cocktail sauce by mixing mayonnaise and ketchup . At this point, assemble the nests: take a basket, fill it with the lettuce, dress with the cocktail sauce , and place the egg slices on top. Your potato nests with eggs are ready to be served!
It is recommended to consume the nests as soon as they are ready. It is not recommended to freeze them.
If you don't want the potato nests to cool too much, organize yourself to have all the various ingredients ready, so you can assemble them rather quickly. Have fun creating baskets with different fillings: for example, stuff them with diced vegetables or small chicken bites.
