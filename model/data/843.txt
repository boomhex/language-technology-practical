instructions:
To prepare the cream and Nutella cake, start by cracking the room-temperature eggs into a bowl, add the sugar and whisk with beaters until you get a fluffy and frothy mixture. Add Nutella
and mix with a spatula . Then pour in the room-temperature milk and incorporate with the sifted flour and baking powder .
Continue mixing until you get a smooth batter without lumps . Transfer it into an 8.5-inch mold, buttered and floured , and bake in a static oven at 356°F, preheated, for about 45 minutes . Once the cake is ready, let it cool and then remove from the mold.
Pour the cream into a bowl and whisk with electric beaters , just before it becomes frothy, add the powdered sugar , and continue to whisk until it's firm .
Cut the cake in half and fill the base with two-thirds of the whipped cream . Transfer the remaining cream into a piping bag with a star nozzle and decorate the surface. Your cream and Nutella cake is ready .
The cream and Nutella cake can be stored in the refrigerator, covered under a cake dome, for 2-3 days.
The cake can be frozen, preferably without decoration; for convenience, you can cut it into slices already.
Missing a bit of chocolate? Add some chocolate flakes or chips either in the batter or on the whipped cream filling.
