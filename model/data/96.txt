instructions:
To prepare the gluten-free bread, crumble the fresh brewer's yeast into the bowl of the stand mixer , pour in a little warm water, taking it from the total amount indicated in the recipe , and stir with a spoon to dissolve it .
Pour in the gluten-free bread mix and gradually add the water with the yeast , continuing to mix with the hook , then add the remaining water as required.
Knead until you get a dense and homogeneous mixture, then pour in the extra virgin olive oil and add the salt . Continue kneading until the dough is elastic, then incorporate the seeds: first the pumpkin seeds (shelled) .
Then add the flax seeds . Work the dough again until it is soft, smooth, and slightly sticky . Transfer it to a surface lightly floured with the flour mix .
Work the dough to obtain a spherical shape , then place it in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap . Let it rise in a warm, sheltered place for about 2 hours, until the dough has doubled in volume . You can store it in the turned-off oven with the light on.
After the rising time, gently transfer the dough into a 8.5x4.5 inch pan, 2.5 inches high, perforated and lined with slightly damp parchment paper . Cover and let it rise for another 20 minutes at room temperature. Then, with a sharp blade, score the surface with a central cut (17–18) to help the bread develop in the oven. Preheat the oven in static mode to 482°F, then lower the temperature to 437°F and bake the bread for about 40 minutes. After baking, you will get a loaf of about 30 oz.
Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool . Once cool, slice it and enjoy it !
Store the gluten-free bread in a paper bag for 2-3 days. It is possible to freeze the bread even in slices.
If you don't have a perforated pan, you can use a regular loaf pan, and after the indicated time, continue baking without the pan at 266°F for 10 minutes to ensure even browning of the crust.
Try customizing the bread by adding other seeds like sunflower, sesame, or poppy: they will add crunchiness and a richer aroma. You can also lightly toast the seeds before incorporating them into the dough to enhance their flavor.
For gluten-free recipes, we recommend purchasing only products that have the crossed grain symbol on the package, certified gluten-free, recommended by the AIC Italian Celiac Association's handbook.
