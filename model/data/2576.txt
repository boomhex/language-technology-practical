Fagottino di pasta fresca is this amazing dish that really brings together the best of Piedmont’s land and sea. You get fresh egg pasta filled with a tasty mix of smoked salmone , rich Piedmontese toma cheese, and crisp radicchio . Honestly, these little bundles are so so tender and packed with flavor. The smoky taste of the salmon just blends into the creamy, sharp toma—seriously good. Fagottino di pasta fresca sits on a smooth crema di patate , which is great. It’s like a warm, silky base that ties everything together perfectly. Piedmont, famous for its intense cheeses and earthy greens, truly shines here. Every bite feels like a journey to Northern Italy—really, it does—with local flavors just mingling in the most exciting ways.
What makes this piatto raffinato really special is its regional twist. While pasta ripiena dishes are everywhere in Italy, using Scottish smoked salmon and unique toma from the Piedmont mountains gives it a distinct personality. The bitterness of the radicchio adds intrigue, making sure each bite offers a little surprise—sometimes creamy, sometimes a bit tangy. You don’t rush this meal. It’s often served as an elegant lunch or when you want something that feels both familiar and a little fancy. The crema di patate underneath just absorbs all those flavors, making everything feel even more moist and rich—so good.
This is classic ricetta italiana, where tradition and innovation meet in a dish that’s both simple and fancy—a real treat. Anyone who enjoys their food with a touch of style and lots of genuine flavor will love it. Whether you're planning a special meal or just want to indulge in something really satisfying, this recipe is sure to impress. And bring a taste of Northern Italy right to your table.
To prepare the fresh pasta bundle with salmon, toma, and radicchio on potato cream, start with the fresh pasta: sift the flour into a bowl , add the egg and begin kneading the dough , then gradually add the water and work it vigorously, first directly in the bowl .
Work the dough in the bowl, then when it becomes more compact , handle it on a slightly floured work surface ; when it is smooth and homogeneous, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature .
In the meantime, focus on the filling: remove the outermost part of the radicchio and cut it into strips . Then sauté a clove of garlic in a pan with a drizzle of oil, add the radicchio, salt, and pepper to taste , and let it stew covered for a few minutes. It will take a few minutes for the radicchio to wilt , then turn off the heat, remove the garlic, and set aside.
In a large pot, bring water to a boil and cook the potatoes (you can also use a pressure cooker to halve the cooking time). Dice the toma cheese and set it aside. At this point, take the fresh pasta that has rested for about 30 minutes, take a piece of it, and keep the rest wrapped in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out from air exposure. Then roll it out slightly and pass it through the pasta machine to the thinnest level .
Divide the dough sheet obtained into rectangles of 5.5x8.25 inches and place them on a slightly floured tray as you make them. Then continue with the rest of the fresh pasta. Then cook it in a large pot with plenty of salted water to taste (do not boil the water too hard to avoid the pasta rectangles from breaking apart); a few seconds will be enough, then drain the pasta and plunge it into cold water. Then transfer it to an oiled tray.
Place the pasta rectangle in a disposable aluminum mold and lay a slice of salmon , then the radicchio and diced toma , then continue with the salmon
Take the edges of the pasta and pinch them with your fingers to close like a pouch ; complete all the bundles and cook in the oven under the grill at 464°F for 4-5 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the potato cream: peel the still-hot potatoes and cut them into pieces
Add the water and blend the potatoes with an immersion blender, adding the oil in a thin stream . Then pour the cream obtained into a small bowl and flavor with thyme leaves .
When the bundles are ready, take them out of the oven and place them on serving plates with the potato cream poured underneath ; your fresh pasta bundles with salmon, radicchio, and toma on potato cream are ready to be enjoyed!
Store the bundles in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 1-2 days.
They can be frozen if you have used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
Even the fresh pasta can be frozen, laid out in rectangles, alternating with dish towels.
You can also make a leek or artichoke cream to accompany the bundle.
