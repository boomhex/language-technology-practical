Big occasions, backyard birthdays, or quiet evenings around the table— Devil's food cake has a rich chocolate flavor that’s pure comfort. What makes this chocolate cake stand apart is its fudgy , moist crumb and that beautiful, deep color you only get from real Dutch-process cocoa . Families pick it for the classic, full-on chocolate experience—kids love the look; adults go straight for that satisfying, super-chocolatey bite. You’ll spot the nice glossy chocolate frosting , shimmering on the surface, and right away you know this is going to be a great (DELICIOUS, honestly) homestyle treat. Pull this traditional dessert out for family get-togethers, or set it up as the star for a school celebration—the way it keeps every slice moist and packed with chocolate keeps people coming back for “just one more.”
Home bakers like that Devil's food cake works for so many situations. It fits busy families—reliable, crowd-pleasing, never fussy, just pure chocolate satisfaction. Wave in a little versatility and serve this cake plain, stacked with fresh berries, or set a scoop of ice cream alongside the nice thick cut…that great , deep flavor works with all your favorites. Kids usually chase the last slice because it’s got that perfect soft , almost creamy bite (especially with a milk drizzle), while grown-ups tend to sneak “quality control” samples because the rich chocolate flavor never gets old. Extra perks—this cake handles swaps (change up the chocolate frosting , try something new) and makes everyone feel at home. Nice for easy birthday parties, weeknight dessert or whenever somebody asks for “CHOCOLATE, please!” in a hurry. It’s simple, satisfying, and made for family tables—so no wonder it stays a go-to when what you want is a classic chocolate cake that always turns out just right for any occasion.
Start the preparation of the devil's food cake by cutting the butter into cubes and letting it soften (or soften it in the microwave). Beat the softened butter with the beaters at moderate speed, and when it becomes light and fluffy, add the sugar and the seeds of the vanilla bean and continue to beat for a few more minutes, occasionally scraping the mixture from the sides of the bowl with a soft spatula .
Add the eggs one at a time at room temperature, still beating. In a small bowl, place the sifted cocoa and add the boiling water to obtain a smooth cream without lumps , then let it cool.
Add the now-cooled cocoa cream to the butter, egg, and sugar mixture. Add the salt, sifted flour, and baking soda to the obtained mixture , then gently mix all the ingredients. Butter and dust 3 cake pans with a diameter of 9 inches ,
then divide the batter into three equal parts and place it into the 3 cake pans . Bake the cake pans in a preheated oven at 350°F for about 30-35 minutes, then when the three cakes are cooked remove them from the oven, let them cool for 15 minutes, and remove them from the molds placing them on a cooling rack. Meanwhile, prepare the filling/coating cream of the devil's cake by placing the cream in a large saucepan and bringing it to the point just before boiling.
Add the dark chocolate to the saucepan and mix well until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture . Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the mixture cool at room temperature, stirring every 15 minutes; then put it in the refrigerator until the mixture thickens (remember to stir every 15 minutes) and becomes rather solid but spreadable .
Place one of the now-cold discs on a plate, spread it with the chocolate cream , cover with a second disc , and cover this too with the layer of chocolate .
Place the last cake on top of the 2 discs filled with chocolate cream and cover the whole cake with the remaining cream (be generous!): if you want to give the coating of the devil's cake the typical "rippling waves" appearance, use a spatula and spread by "moving" the cream . The devil's food cake is ready to be enjoyed! Remember to store the cake in the refrigerator.
