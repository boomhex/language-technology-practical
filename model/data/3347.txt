Sfilati alle olive con porcini e lardo are these super crispy Tuscan breadsticks that bring a real taste of the Italian countryside right to your table. Really good stuff. Inside, they're tender and packed with a mix of green and black olives, all snuggled up in a golden, oven-baked shell. What makes these so so different from any other Italian breadsticks ? It's the way folks in Toscana wrap them with slices of lardo di Colonnata . And the lardo? It’s that special cured pork fat from the region—melts beautifully over the warm sticks, giving everything this rich, moist flavor. Really, these are definitely not your average store-bought grissini.
In Tuscany, people love enjoying these as a kind of finger food at a classy aperitivo, especially in autumn when porcini mushrooms are in season. The subtle, earthy flavor from the porcini cream makes these olive breadsticks pretty much extra special. Plus, you’ll see how the lardo pulls all the flavors together in a way that’s pure Tuscan tradition.

People really love the contrast—the crispy crust with the soft, almost buttery inside. Seriously good. Every bite gives you a bit of briny olive, a hint of earthy mushroom, and that melt-in-your-mouth lardo.
It’s a really nice twist on a grissini recipe , because it blends local ingredients in such a cool, original way. Even if you're used to regular breadsticks, these have a kind of rich flavor that feels pretty gourmet. They're awesome as porcini mushroom appetizers at a party or just a snack with drinks.

With every bite, you're taken on a journey through the beautiful landscapes of Tuscany, making these breadsticks not just a treat, but an experience worth sharing.
Start by preparing the aromatic porcini cream: with a sharp knife with a smooth blade, begin to remove the earthy part from the mushroom stalk; gently scrape the stalk until all traces of dirt are gone. Also gently scrape the outside of the porcini cap and finish cleaning by wiping the entire mushroom with a damp cotton cloth. Then cut the porcini mushrooms into pieces . Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the crushed garlic and let it soften. Then add the mushrooms and sauté them for about 10 minutes. A few minutes before the end of cooking, also add a chopped mixture of parsley and thyme .
Finally, add the fresh cream and salt and pepper to taste. Blend the mushrooms with a mixer (or an immersion blender) to obtain a smooth sauce. Spread each "La Bottega di Olivia&Marino" olive breadstick with the aromatic porcini mushroom cream and wrap a slice of Colonnata lardo around it ; serve the snacks immediately!
