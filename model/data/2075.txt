instructions:
To prepare avocado, eggs, and salmon, grate the lime zest and collect it in a small bowl . Chop the chives and set aside . Now cut the avocado in half (the recipe requires two for a total of 1.5 lbs) ,
remove the pit , squeeze the lime juice onto the pulp to prevent it from browning, then score the pulp with a small knife horizontally and then vertically , making it easier to extract the pulp with the spoon.
Place a slice of smoked salmon on each avocado half , salt, pepper, and season with the grated lime zest . Now prepare the fried eggs: heat a skillet with a drizzle of olive oil ,
pour the eggs gently taking care not to break them . Cook the eggs for about 2-3 minutes. Once cooked, scoop each egg with a spoon and place it on the avocado .
Season with pink peppercorns , garnish with the chopped chives and serve your avocado, eggs, and salmon immediately !
It is recommended to serve the avocado, eggs, and salmon immediately.
