instructions:
To prepare the rice pudding and cookies, pour the water into a large pot, add the rice and a pinch of salt . Bring to a boil over low heat for about 15 minutes or until all the water has been absorbed. Now add the sugar ,
the milk , the seeds of the vanilla pod , and the whole emptied pod . Stir with a wooden spoon. Let it simmer over very low heat for about 35 minutes.
The result should be creamy, and the rice should be cooked. Remove the pod and pour the rice pudding into 4 bowls, each with a diameter of 4.75 inches and a height of 2.75 inches . Make sure to pour the rice while it's still hot. Let it cool at room temperature, then transfer to the fridge until it sets, about 2 hours. Once this time has passed, crumble the cookies coarsely with your hands .
Distribute them on each bowl of rice pudding , garnish with some blueberries , fresh mint leaves, and serve .
Store the rice pudding in the refrigerator for 2 days, in a container covered with plastic wrap. We do not recommend freezing.
You can use cinnamon instead of vanilla to flavor the rice pudding. Alternatively, you can use citrus zest and remove it before the rice thickens. You can enrich the dessert with dried fruits like almonds or hazelnuts.
