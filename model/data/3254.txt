Caffè meringato is this Italian coffee dessert that you might stumble upon in a cozy bar in Milan or some hidden gem in Rome. Yet, it's pretty simple to whip up at home. Picture this: a shot of smooth espresso layered with cold, creamy custard—called crema pasticcera, a favorite in Italy—and topped with crispy crumbled meringues. Really good stuff. A sprinkle of bitter cocoa powder adds a nice edge to the sweet and rich layers below.
In Italy, it's a bit of a fancy morning treat and also a quick dessert you can whip up in no time—especially if the custard is made ahead. Here's the thing, the magic happens as the hot espresso swirls with the chilled custard, blending into a bite of moist meringue and rich coffee flavor.
Honestly, you don’t need any special occasion to dive into a caffè meringato —it's perfect for whenever you want something a bit different. Some folks say the secret lies in using a Moka pot for brewing the espresso. You know, it gives you that deep, bold taste Italians love. In some regions, you might find twists like pistachio meringues or a splash of liqueur, but the basics remain the same: strong coffee, silky custard, and those light, airy meringues.
As a coffee meringue dessert , it stands out because it looks fancy but really comes together quickly—if your custard is already chilled. Whether you’re serving it to friends after dinner or treating yourself on a lazy weekend, this coffee meringue recipe brings a touch of Italian café culture right to your kitchen. And you know what? It’s one of those Italian dessert recipes that feels both special and super easy, leaving you dreaming of your next trip to a sunny Italian piazza, even if you’re just lounging at home. Honestly, it’s just really, really good.
To prepare meringue coffee, start by making the custard: heat the milk in a saucepan with half a vanilla bean and its seeds . Whisk the egg yolk and sugar in a bowl , then add the flour. Use tongs to remove the bean and
pour the warmed milk into the mixture slowly , blending with the whisk. Return the mixture to the heat and stir continuously until the custard has thickened . Transfer the custard to a bowl and let it cool, covering it with a sheet of plastic wrap in contact with the surface .
Meanwhile, prepare the coffee with the coffee maker: to get excellent coffee, fill the boiler of your coffee maker with cold water, preferably low in calcium, being careful not to exceed the safety valve (otherwise you will get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee forming a mound that you will level by tapping the filter on the table with decisive movements (8-9). Do not press with a spoon, nor make holes on the surface.
Close the coffee maker very tightly , so that the coffee does not spill from the sides as it rises, and place it over a low and steady flame to obtain a full-bodied coffee. As the coffee rises, a dense froth will form : we recommend not letting the coffee boil too long to maintain its sweetness and aroma. Your coffee is ready: before using it, stir it directly in the moka with a teaspoon to make the coffee more homogeneous .
While the coffee is on the stove, put 2 tablespoons (about 1 oz) of well-chilled custard in each glass and spread it on the bottom and sides of the glass, covering 3/4 of the height of the glass (13-14). Crumble the meringues with your hands into rather large pieces .
Pour the hot coffee until it completely covers the custard . Decorate the glass with a generous spoonful of broken meringues and a dusting of unsweetened cocoa powder . Your meringue coffee is ready!
Consume the meringue coffee immediately.
Instead of dusting the meringue coffee with cocoa, you can top it with a drizzle of caramel.
