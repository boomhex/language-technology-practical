instructions:
To prepare the cistecca montese, start with the eggplants, clean them, and cut them into cubes. Then move on to the meat, which needs to be cut into very small cubes . Thinly slice the smoked scamorza cheese and grate the provolone cheese .
Move to the stove. In a pan, fry the halved garlic in a drizzle of oil . Add the eggplants and sauté, stirring occasionally. When they are softened, remove the garlic and season with salt and pepper to taste, then set aside; you'll need the pan later.
Pour a splash of oil into another pan and add the meat , sauté it for a few minutes over high heat until well browned but tender inside. Then add salt and pepper and the previously sautéed eggplants, allowing everything to gain flavor .
Meanwhile, halve the baguettes lengthwise and briefly toast them in the pan used to cook the eggplants, making sure that the crumb is in contact with the pan . When the crumb is slightly browned, remove the bread .
Place a few lettuce leaves on the base of each sandwich . At this point, gather the meat into 2 piles roughly the size of the sandwiches , lower the heat a little, and add the smoked scamorza cheese on top .
In just a few moments it will be melted, so turn off the heat and lift the filling with a spatula , placing it directly on the baguette base . Add the grated caciocavallo cheese on top .
Then close with the other half , and here is the first sandwich ready . Prepare the second one, and your cistecca montese is finally ready .
It is recommended to consume the cistecca montese immediately.
The addition of eggplants is to give a summer touch and extra flavor to the cistecca montese; feel free to use other sides as well. For example, in Naples, friarielli, eggplant parmigiana, fresh tomatoes with arugula are used.
Up until some time ago, the cistecca montese had a somewhat different appearance. It was born at the beginning of the 1900s from the idea of two brothers, Pat and Harry Olivieri, who made their fortune in America thanks to their hot dog stand. One day, the Italian-American brothers, having run out of hot dogs, decided to use freshly sliced meat directly on the griddle, mixing it with cheese. The combination of cheese + steak, hence the cistecca! Only in the 80s, when the migratory flow reversed, did it bring the best from the States to Italy. The Montese, inhabitants of Monte di Procida, introduced the cistecca from kiosks to restaurants, quickly becoming the typical dish and true pride of local and Campanian cuisine. In 2014, a group of Phlegraean entrepreneurs decided to join forces in the form of a Consortium to protect the product and provide a production guideline.
