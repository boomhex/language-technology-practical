To prepare the cherry and vanilla compote, first wash the cherries thoroughly with cold water . Drain them and remove the pits and stems , then gather them in a thick-bottomed saucepan, adding the sugar as well .
Add the vanilla pulp and also the emptied pod . Grate the lemon zest into the saucepan .
Then squeeze and strain the lemon juice, and add it too . Mix well and place on the stove over medium heat. Let the mixture come to a boil, then lower the heat .
Continue cooking for about 40 minutes, or until the compote reaches a temperature of 226°F : at that point, it will be ready. Remove the vanilla bean and transfer the cherry and vanilla compote into a container .
If you want to consume your compote immediately, place it in the fridge in a closed container as soon as it is cold. It will keep for up to 10 days. If you want to preserve it longer, proceed with the vacuum method as with all jams.
If you want to make your compote very special, you can flavor it with a pinch of ginger! If instead, you prefer to give it a fresher taste, replace the lemon zest and juice with that of 2 limes.
