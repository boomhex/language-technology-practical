To prepare the pea velouté with little eyes, start by chopping the onion and wash, peel, and dice the potatoes . In a large pan, heat the oil and melt the butter and
add the onion to let it soften . When the onion is well stewed, add the diced potatoes and let them brown for 5 minutes. At this point, add the peas , stir, and cover the vegetables with vegetable broth or water.
Let cook until the vegetables are softened, adding more broth if necessary, then salt and add nutmeg . Transfer the vegetables to a blender and blend everything (an immersion blender works well too). Add more broth as desired until you reach the desired consistency and thickness .
Once the pea velouté is ready, proceed to make the cheese balls: in a bowl, combine the ricotta and Parmesan and mix the two cheeses with a spoon until you get a homogeneous mixture . Then take a teaspoon of the mixture and shape it into a nice round ball with your palms
Cut the stuffed olives into thin slices and gently place them on the cheese balls : the olives will be the pupils of your eyeballs. Once the little eyes are ready , place them gently on the pea velouté, which you have poured into individual bowls. What do you think, does your pea velouté look terrifying?
Store the Halloween velouté with little eyes in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
Instead of little eyes, you can also opt for the more common croutons. Cut some bread into slices and toast it in the oven or create small croutons by cutting sandwich bread into small squares, then browning them in a pan over medium heat without any seasoning. Place the pea velouté in individual bowls, add a drizzle of olive oil, the croutons in the center of the plate, and serve.
