Making it is really a breeze: with a few quality ingredients and a pinch of creativity, you can serve a dish that will win over your guests. The basic ingredients are few but chosen for perfect balance: cooked ham, delicate and savory, fresh ricotta cheese, which adds softness, and a touch of cream to make everything even fluffier and more velvety. Just blend these elements together, optionally personalizing the taste with a pinch of pepper or aromatic herbs, and it's ready! Whether you have unexpected guests or want to impress with a festive buffet, ham mousse will be your ally in the kitchen.
Here are more mousses you shouldn't miss:

To prepare the ham mousse, first tear it by hand into a bowl , then add the ricotta cheese and blend with an immersion mixer .
Once you have obtained a cream , pour in the fresh cream and blend again .
You should achieve a smooth and homogeneous consistency . Transfer to a small bowl, garnish with thyme leaves , and the ham mousse is ready ! Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until use.
It is recommended to consume the ham mousse within a day and to store it in the refrigerator well covered with plastic wrap.
It is preferable not to blend all the ingredients together at once; otherwise, a lumpy texture will form, and the cream will not blend with the mixture. Instead of ricotta, you can use a spreadable cheese.
