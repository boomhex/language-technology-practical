Trim , wash, and dry the eggplants, then peel them and cut them into slices about ¼ inch thick .
Sprinkle them with coarse salt and let them lose their vegetation water in a colander, on which you will place a plate with a weight on top. Leave them like this for at least one and a half hours. Meanwhile, pour into a saucepan 2 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of water ; bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved.
Cook the syrup for a few minutes , being careful not to let it caramelize, then add the chopped chocolate and stir until it is also melted .
Place the sifted unsweetened cocoa in a bowl , add about 1 1/4 cups of cold water, stir, and add the sifted flour ; mix until you get a thick and lump-free cream. Add the cocoa and flour mixture to the syrup , let it cook until everything is thick, then turn off the heat.
After the necessary time has passed, rinse the eggplants , dry them , and fry them in plenty of oil until golden, then place them on kitchen paper to absorb the excess oil.
Take a baking dish and pour some chocolate cream on the bottom ; start arranging the eggplant slices close to each other to form a first layer that you will cover with cream .
Sprinkle with some pine nuts, almonds, and candied citron , then create another layer until the ingredients are finished; finish with a layer of cream that you will sprinkle with the dried and candied fruit. Bake for 15 minutes at 212 degrees Fahrenheit, then serve.
A widespread variant of eggplants with chocolate involves frying them after having floured and dipped them in beaten egg.; afterwards, they are passed in a mixture of sugar, cinnamon, and grated lemon zest. Very often the chocolate cream is prepared with milk and also the addition of crumbled amaretti to the preparation is very common.
