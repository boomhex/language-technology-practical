To prepare grilled lamb chops, first prepare the chops by removing any excess parts and pounding the meat with a meat mallet . Place the chops in a baking dish, salt and pepper to taste on both sides, coat them with oil , and season with chopped garlic
and fresh rosemary . Leave the seasoned chops to marinate in the fridge for about 30 minutes. After marinating, they will be ready for cooking. Heat a cast iron grill and cook the chops over high heat for about 4 minutes per side . Once the chops are cooked, serve your grilled lamb chops very hot accompanied by a few slices of lemon.
