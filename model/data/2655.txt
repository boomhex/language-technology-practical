To prepare the sour cherry soufflé, blend the sour cherries with the juice (300 g total of pulp and preservation liquid) , until you get a smooth purée . Pour it into a small saucepan
and add the fresh liquid cream ; stir and turn on the heat, then bring the mixture to a temperature of 194°F (you can measure it with a kitchen thermometer). While the mixture is heating, beat the eggs in a small bowl, add the corn and rice starch and mix to dissolve them .
When the sour cherries have reached 194°F , turn off the heat, let cool completely, and only then add the beaten eggs with the starches , mix , and set aside.
In a bowl, beat the egg whites with sugar using an electric mixer or a hand whisk and add them to the cherry mixture , mixing from top to bottom so the egg whites do not lose their volume. Then butter and sugar the molds
Then fill them with the mixture up to the brim and level the surface with a spatula (13-14). Place the sour cherry soufflés in a preheated static oven at 338°F for about 13 minutes (to better gauge the cooking, you can test it on just one soufflé). Once cooked and well risen, remove the sour cherry soufflés from the oven and let them cool slightly , then dust them with powdered sugar before serving!
It is recommended to consume the sour cherry soufflés as soon as they are ready while still warm.
You can freeze them if you used all fresh, not previously frozen, ingredients.
