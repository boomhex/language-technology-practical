To prepare the garden soup, start by cleaning all the vegetables. After washing, peeling, and trimming the ends off the carrots, slice them into rounds using a wavy-edged mandoline if preferred . Then proceed to chop the celery stalk into chunks with a knife . Clean both cabbages, then after cutting the cauliflower in half, remove the central part
and separate the florets, also removing the excess stalk . Do the same for the Romanesco broccoli . Finally, after washing and trimming the ends off all the green beans, cut them into 2 or 3 parts depending on their length .
In a pot with some oil, start to pour in the vegetables ready for cooking: add carrots and celery and after sautéing them for a couple of minutes, add the cauliflower and Romanesco broccoli along with the green beans and season with salt and pepper .
Finally, scent with bay leaves and cover with water , letting it cook with the lid on for 15 minutes over moderate heat .
Next, add the shelled peas and let cook for another 15 minutes. When your vegetables are ready, all that's left is to throw the pasta into the pot and cook it along with the vegetables , but first, make sure the water is sufficient; if not, add a bit more and wait for it to boil before adding the pasta. Once cooked, the garden soup is ready to be served !
You can prepare the soup in advance, even the day before; in this case, we recommend cooking the pasta at the moment. The soup can be frozen.
Let your imagination run wild! Add, reduce, or substitute the vegetables as you like! Spice it up as preferred, perhaps adding some cinnamon or cardamom seeds.
