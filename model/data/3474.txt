To prepare tartar sauce, start by hard-boiling 4 eggs. Meanwhile, finely chop the pickles and capers with a knife , and also chop the parsley and tarragon . Separate the hard-boiled egg yolks and place them in a bowl, add the white wine vinegar , a good pinch of salt, and a grind of black pepper.
Place the bowl on a dampened cloth so it won't move during the preparation of the sauce, then work the yolks with a wooden spoon until the ingredients are well combined . Finally, add the two fresh yolks and start whisking the mixture with electric beaters, as you would for a classic mayonnaise; then slowly incorporate the oil first drop by drop and then in a thin stream while continuing to whisk with the beaters . Be careful not to add too much oil at once and always whisk in the same direction, otherwise, the sauce might curdle. Once all the oil has been incorporated, the sauce should have a thick and creamy consistency. At this point, you can incorporate the chopped pickles, capers, parsley, and tarragon . The tartar sauce is ready to be enjoyed!
If the basic preparation curdles, here's the remedy: in another bowl, place another yolk; blend again by adding a thin stream of oil and then, always in the bowl, add the curdled mixture one spoonful at a time very slowly, and everything should return to normal. To prevent the tartar sauce from curdling, avoid adding too much oil at once, which impairs the proper emulsification with the yolk.
