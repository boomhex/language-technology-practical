Deep, creamy flavor and a fun, shareable style put chocolate fondue at the heart of family gatherings, party nights, and easy celebrations. With a lush, glossy look and classic fondue pot on the table, this dessert brings everyone in close for a simple yet surprisingly special treat. Each swirl in the warm chocolate ganache delivers that rich , good chocolate experience families always want from a relaxing dessert. Beautiful with a spread of strawberries , juicy segments of other fruit, and crowd-pleasing marshmallows, this classic dessert draws kids and adults alike back for dip after dip. Whenever you need something DELICIOUS and playful that still ticks all those cozy, familiar boxes, this reliable chocolate fondue stands out—everyone customizes their favorite bites (love that feeling when you dunk a big piece of fruit).
Group celebrations, birthdays, and movie nights usually get a boost when a fondue pot of sweet , velvety chocolate makes an appearance—some friends even call this their go-to entertaining treat since it’s so EASY and fun. Being able to pick from so many dipping ideas (try pineapple, pound cake, or even pretzels next time) really adds variety, while the classic combo of chocolate and soft fruit just always works. Flexible enough for big holiday dessert tables or quiet weekend nights, chocolate fondue adapts easily to lots of occasions. For busy families, it’s a stress-free way to get everyone talking and laughing, and home cooks pretty much love the way the finished dessert always looks impressive with no fuss (kids are eager to help dip—sometimes too eager!). Nice bonus: the warm chocolate stays smooth and creamy in the fondue pot , so each bite is as nice and satisfying as the first. Try setting out extra strawberries and change up your fondue recipe with new dipper ideas…that’s a family dessert routine no one gets tired of.
To prepare chocolate fondue with strawberries, melt the dark chocolate in a double boiler: pour it into a heatproof bowl placed in a pot half-filled with water . Turn on medium heat and add the already hot cream (2-3) gradually to the chocolate.
Stir with a wooden spatula to mix the ingredients and completely melt the chocolate . Once the mixture is uniform, you can add the brandy , or another liquor of your choice, stir and continue cooking for a few more minutes on very low heat: you should get a velvety mixture.
Once ready , turn off the heat and transfer the melted chocolate into the special container with the burner underneath to keep everything warm. Wash and dry the strawberries and, without removing the stem, place them on a small plate. To enjoy the fondue, you can take the strawberries between your fingers and dip them directly into the chocolate, or use the special steel forks that are usually sold with the fondue set . If you prefer, you can use long toothpicks to enjoy chocolate fondue with strawberries.
Store the melted chocolate with cling wrap at room temperature for a few hours.
An alternative way to present this dish is to transform the strawberries into little ladybugs. It's very simple: dip the upper part of the strawberries (the one with the stem) into the melted chocolate prepared as in the recipe. Prepare a parchment paper cone filled with the melted chocolate and sealed with a pin or some tape; then make a vertical line and the classic ladybug dots on the strawberries. Let the chocolate dry for a few minutes and make two spots, with a bit of cream, on the head of the ladybugs as eyes, always using a parchment paper cone. Let dry for 15 minutes
Same method, different colors: get creative with the fruit and bring to the table the ones you prefer, for example, kiwis, peaches, apples, pears, and bananas (be careful as the last three fruits tend to darken, to avoid this dip them in lemon juice after cutting), but also little cookies or marshmallows.
