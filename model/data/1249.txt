First, start with the pumpkin. Remove the peel , cut it into cubes about 1.2 inches large , and place them in a steamer .
Cover with a lid and cook for about 20 minutes . Meanwhile, proceed to make the rice polenta. Take the orange peel and cut it first into strips and then into very small cubes .
Do the same with the lemon peel . In a saucepan, pour milk and cream , move to the heat and warm until it reaches a temperature of 140°F .
Add the sugar and stir with a whisk until it dissolves. Add the cinnamon , stir again, add the orange peel, the lemon peel
and finally the seeds from the vanilla pod . Stir , wait a few seconds, then slowly add the rice flour, pouring it like rain , while continuing to stir to avoid lumps.
Continue stirring for a few seconds until it thickens . Keep the cream warm, you can opt for a bain-marie, this way it will remain creamy. By this point, the pumpkin will be ready , transfer 200 g into a tall-sided container and let it cool. Grate the orange peel and chop it with a knife to obtain a pulp .
Add the orange pulp to the container with the pumpkin and blend until you get a smooth and homogeneous cream . Then transfer the cream into a pastry bag with a narrow nozzle. Set aside the pumpkin cream and prepare the rice crunch. In a pan, pour the water, sugar
and let it caramelize, stirring with a wooden spoon until it reaches an amber color . Once ready, pour in the puffed rice at once
and keep stirring until the caramel completely covers the puffed rice . Transfer onto a baking sheet with parchment paper and spread it out as much as possible .
Let it cool and then crumble it with your hands, without pulverizing the rice but trying to separate the grains . Now everything is ready, you can plate. Pour the warm rice cream at the bottom of the plate , then add the rice crunch to cover the cream and some finely chopped hazelnuts.
Complete the plate by creating a spiral of pumpkin cream and some flakes of Maldon salt . Your rice pudding and pumpkin dessert is ready to enjoy !
