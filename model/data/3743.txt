Golden, fluffy tops and a pull-apart style give Austrian sweet rolls their special charm—whether for family breakfasts or relaxed afternoon coffee. The beautiful golden color and soft inside of these pull-apart rolls make them a favorite at every table, especially since a classic apricot jam center adds just the right sweet burst in each bite. The texture has that brioche-like DELICIOUSNESS—light, airy crumb but still satisfying—which gives every roll a tender feel as you break it open. Shared fresh on busy mornings or passed around for snacks, these yeast buns catch the eye with their lightly browned finish, while family and friends notice how easily they pull apart. Adding a side of vanilla custard sauce is a nice touch, bringing creamy sweetness that goes perfectly with every slice. For home cooks looking to serve something simple that looks really nice and always makes people smile, this classic treat blends memory and flavor without fuss—a true staple for anyone who loves easy, family-friendly sweets.
Busy families definitely appreciate these fluffy yeast pastries because they work so well for many occasions—often breakfast, snack time, or even a last-minute dessert. That soft , moist bite satisfies picky eaters while the lovely golden appearance gives a little extra cheer to any table (kids often grab them fast, especially with the surprise of fruity jam or even chocolate filling). These pull-apart rolls turn every gathering into a small celebration, and serving with vanilla custard sauce makes dessert feel just a bit more special. Great for big brunches, holiday brunch spreads, or simple Sunday mornings—people tend to ask for seconds...or take one for later since the rolls stay nice and tender for a while. With so much versatility and family appeal (try customizing with seasonal jams or fun toppings), Austrian sweet rolls are a go-to for reliable results. Warm, inviting, and absolutely family-approved—simple treats like this really become part of what everyone looks forward to at home.
In a small bowl, combine the warm milk, sugar, and crumbled fresh yeast ; stir until the yeast dissolves , then place the bowl in a warm spot (not exceeding 95 degrees Fahrenheit) for about 20 minutes and let it rise .
After the indicated time, pour the mixture into a large bowl containing the flour, seeds from the vanilla bean, grated lemon (or orange) zest, and a pinch of salt; add the melted butter , beaten eggs and knead the ingredients well until you form a ball of dough that you will let rest, covered, for 30 minutes in a warm place.
After half an hour, take the risen dough and roll it out on a floured surface until you get a sheet about 3/8 inch thick ;
Using a circular pastry cutter with a diameter of 2 1/2 to 3 inches, cut out at least 12 circular shapes . Gently stretch the dough shapes with your fingers and place a teaspoon of apricot jam in the center of each one , then close them well as shown in the photo (13-14-15).
Close them well by bringing the side edges and then the top and bottom towards the center until you get a ball (13-14-15).
Melt the remaining butter and brush each pastry piece completely , placing them seam side down in a buttered baking dish . Arrange the pastries close together until all are used up, and let them rise for 30 minutes, covering the baking dish with a clean cloth ; if you have leftover melted butter, pour it evenly over the pastries in the dish. Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F for 30 minutes, then remove the buchteln from the oven, let them cool slightly in the baking dish, and then turn them onto a tray (or work surface), separate them, and dust with powdered sugar. Serve them still warm.
To make the hot orange sauce to cover the buchteln, simply boil some orange juice quickly with some sugar. Buchteln should be eaten while still warm, as once cold, they do not retain all the fragrance, aroma, and goodness of freshly baked pastries.
