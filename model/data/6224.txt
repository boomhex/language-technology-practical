With their extremely sweet flavor, high digestibility and color that never goes unnoticed, red Tropea onion is one of the products that characterizes the cuisine of Calabria. Braids of these onions hung ubiquitous throughout the alleyways of this town nestled on a cliff edge over the sea: you won't be able to resist buying one for yourself and as a souvenir for your friends. You can prepare them oven baked, use them as a condiment for a rich first course, or for an extremely simple recipe that exalts all their flavor: red onion fritters . A morish starter you can prepare in just a few minutes. All you'll need is water, a little flour and these special onions to sweeten your return from the holidays!
Peel and thinly slice the onions . Place them in a colander inside a bowl and sprinkle with two spoons of fine salt . Mix thoroughly by hand and rub for ten minutes or so to soften and draw out the moisture.
Now rinse thoroughly to remove the excess salt , drain the water and place in a bowl. Finely chop the parsley and add to the onions .
Now add the flour , stir and then add the water .
Thoroughly mix the ingredients together by hand and add salt to taste . Heat abundant oil to 340 °F ( 170 °C) , then using two spoons add a few fritters at a time .
Fry the fritters for around 8 minutes, until nice and golden , then drain them one by one and place on a tray lined with kitchen paper to remove excess oil . Serve your red onion fritters nice and hot .
These fritters are best enjoyed freshly fried! If you prefer, you can store the batter in the refrigerator for one day, thoroughly covered.
You can use basil instead of parsley, and chilled beer instead of water!
