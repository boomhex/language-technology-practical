instructions:
To make the pea and robiola savory pie, first blanch the peas in a large amount of boiling water and cook them for a few minutes after the water comes to a boil . Drain the peas and blend them with an immersion blender .
You should obtain a smooth and compact cream that you will set aside for now. Now melt the butter in a saucepan and let it cool. Work eggs and salt with an electric mixer, without over-whipping .
Add the melted butter and the pea cream , mix with the mixer, and then add the sifted flour .
Also incorporate the sifted yeast , continue mixing with the beaters, and gradually pour in the milk . Keep working with the beaters until all the ingredients are combined .
Place the robiola and the whole egg in a bowl. Salt, pepper , and mix with a hand whisk until you obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Transfer the mixture into a piping bag . Butter a springform pan with a diameter of about 7 inches , pour in half of the pea pie batter .
Add half of the robiola cream , cover with the remaining pea batter, finish with the robiola cream , and gently swirl the surface with the tip of a knife .
The pie is ready for baking . Bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for about 55 minutes. Remove from oven , let it cool slightly, then unmold your pea and robiola savory pie !
The pea and robiola savory pie can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. It can be frozen after baking.
This pie will also be delicious as a sweet version: just omit the robiola cream and fill it with a chocolate ganache!
