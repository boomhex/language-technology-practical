instructions:
To prepare baked cod with potatoes, first peel the potatoes and slice them thinly . Parboil the potatoes in salted water for 5 minutes , then drain them. Meanwhile, finely chop the garlic and line 2 baking trays with parchment paper, brushing the center with oil .
Take the first tray: lay down a layer of potatoes, slightly overlapping them , to form a rectangle large enough to accommodate 2 fillets . Then place the fish on top .
Add chopped garlic , parsley on the fillets and drizzle with white wine .
Also adjust the salt , then cover with more potatoes and season again with a pinch of salt and a drizzle of oil . Do the same with the second tray.
Finish with more chopped parsley and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 25-30 minutes, until the potatoes are golden and the fish is well cooked. Remove from oven and serve your baked cod with potatoes hot !
Baked cod with potatoes can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
If you have used all fresh ingredients, it can be frozen.
For an extra touch of flavor, add a sprinkle of untreated lemon zest just before serving: it will enhance the delicacy of the fish and make the dish even more fragrant. As an alternative to wine, you can use a little of the potato cooking water.
