Add the chili pepper and onion . After a few moments, season with the masala .
Add the cumin and turmeric , then stir . Let it cook for about 8 minutes over medium-low heat.
When the onion has softened, add the tomato and tomato paste . After 2-3 minutes, add the chickpeas, which you have previously drained and rinsed .
Pour in the coconut milk , then salt and mix well. Cook for about 25 minutes, always over medium-low heat . Serve your chickpea masala garnished with coriander and a squeeze of lime !
The chickpea masala can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days in an airtight container.
If you don't like coriander, you can replace it with parsley.
You can omit the fresh tomatoes and use only the paste.
For an even creamier result, you can blend half of the mixture!
