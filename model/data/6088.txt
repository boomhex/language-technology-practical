To prepare guacamole , start by peeling and finely chopping the onion ; finely chop the coriander too . Cut the avocado in half and remove the pit .
Scoop the pulp out using a spoon and place it in a mortar . Add the lime juice and mash into a cream .
Now add the chopped onion and the coriander ; mash to amalgamate some more and season with salt . If you like spice, now is the time to add some fresh peperoncino or a few drops of tabasco.
Lastly, dice the tomatoes and add them to the sauce . Your guacamole is ready to be served !
Guacamole can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days at most, in a sealed container.
The secret to a delicious guacamole lies in the use of ripe avocado, which should be soft to the touch, but not squishy.
If you don't have a mortar, mash the avocado with a fork.
White onion can be replaced with red or fresh spring onion.
If you don't like the flavor of coriander, leave it out or replace it with parsley.
The name guacamole originates from Ahuacamolli , where ahuacatl means avocado in the Aztec language (which becomes aguacates in Mexican), and molli means sauce.
Guacamole sauce was originally made with avocado, lime and salt, but the recipe has been enriched over time.
