To prepare the yogurt cake with strawberry and berry jelly, start by placing the cookies in the mixer and activating the blades to grind them into powder. Transfer the cookie powder to a bowl and add the butter, which you have melted in a saucepan . Mix well to obtain a homogeneous mixture.
Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper and spread the mixture on the bottom , pressing with the back of a spoon to create a compact and smooth base . Transfer to the freezer to set for at least half an hour so that the mixture solidifies. Meanwhile, attend to the cream: sieve the ricotta in a bowl to remove the whey.
Add the Greek yogurt and, with a spatula or a whisk, begin to mix. Add the powdered sugar , then take the vanilla bean, cut it lengthwise, and scrape the seeds with the tip of a knife .
Add the vanilla seeds to the creamy mixture and mix again until smooth . At this point, soak the gelatin in cold water for about 10 minutes .
Heat the cream in a saucepan, and after the soaking time, squeeze the now-soft gelatin and add it to the hot cream , stirring until completely dissolved. Add the liquid to the yogurt cream mixture , mix thoroughly to incorporate it evenly, then remove the springform pan from the freezer and pour the mixture over the cookie base , smoothing it gently.
Refrigerate to set well for at least 2 hours . Meanwhile, prepare the jelly for the topping. Clean and wash the strawberries and cut them in half . Place them in a large pan along with the raspberries
And the blueberries , and also add the powdered sugar . Stir and cook over low heat for at least 10 minutes, then strain the resulting puree through a sieve .
Transfer the puree to a saucepan , soak the gelatin in cold water for 10 minutes , squeeze it, and add it to the hot puree in the saucepan , stirring well to dissolve it completely.
Strain the mixture and let it cool slightly, then pour it into the cake pan over the layer of yogurt cream, which will have set by now . Smooth it well and transfer it to the fridge, where the cake should set for another 2 hours .
After the time has elapsed, open the pan and carefully remove the parchment paper . Place the yogurt cake on a cake stand or serving tray , and finally, before serving, decorate it with the berries, the whole strawberry, and the mint leaves .
The yogurt cake with strawberry and berry jelly can be stored in the fridge, covered, for 2-3 days. You can also freeze it, already divided into portions, using suitable food containers and then letting it thaw in the fridge as needed.
