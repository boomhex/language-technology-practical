You’ll find these served as easy finger foods during aperitivo hour, and they’re perfect for anyone wanting a snack that’s a little different but still classic.

To prepare the speck bundles stuffed with robiola with torcelli, start by making the robiola cream: finely chop the herbs (thyme, basil, and chives) , then add them to the robiola , which you have previously placed in a large bowl. Mix to combine all the ingredients
and add a tablespoon of sweet paprika to the mixture . Once the cream is ready, transfer it to a piping bag with a star tip and set it aside. Now take the speck slices and fold them over themselves to form cones, holding the bottom end of the slice with a finger to facilitate the operation (5-6) (make sure to keep the peppered side facing outwards).
Fill each cone with the previously prepared robiola cream , and secure it by tying each cone with a chive strand , to which you will also tie a torcello . The speck bundles stuffed with robiola with torcelli are ready: enjoy your meal!
You can store the speck bundles stuffed with robiola with torcelli in an airtight container and keep them in the refrigerator for up to one day.
If you prefer, you can prepare the filling cream using other creamy cheeses of your choice (we recommend goat cheese or Philadelphia).
