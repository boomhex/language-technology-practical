instructions:
To prepare the pumpkin, mushroom, and Taleggio risotto, cut the pumpkin into slices, peel it, and dice it, then boil it in a quart of salted water . Remove the soil attached to the ends of the stems , then clean the mushrooms with a damp cloth, slice them , and put them in a pan with three tablespoons of oil and a clove of chopped garlic until they are cooked but still crunchy.
At the end of cooking, add a pinch of salt to the mushrooms. When the pumpkin is cooked, drain it well , keep the cooking water that will be used to moisten the risotto, and puree it with a mixer .
Put the chopped onion and butter in a rather large pot and let them sauté for a few minutes; pour in the rice and let it toast for a moment, then deglaze with the white wine and let it cook until the wine has evaporated. Then add a ladle of pumpkin cooking liquid and subsequently the pumpkin puree ;
Continue cooking the rice and five minutes before the end, add the mushrooms to the risotto pot ; finish cooking, then turn off the heat .
At this point, add 4 tablespoons of grated Grana Padano PDO and the Taleggio cut into chunks , which you will add to the risotto to cream it. Before serving the pumpkin, mushroom, and Taleggio risotto, give a light sprinkle of black pepper and nutmeg .
