instructions:
To prepare the bouillabaisse, first clean the fish: cut the fins of the red mullet , then remove the scales by rubbing the body with your hands in the opposite direction . Cut open the belly, remove the guts, and rinse well under running water . Finally, remove the eyes, which would give a bitter note to the soup.
Proceed in the same way to clean the gurnard: remove the fins and eyes, then scale the body with the appropriate tool . Cut open the belly and remove the guts. Cut off the head and set it aside for the stock.
Move on to the monkfish: remove the skin if present, and cut the tail end, which will be used for the stock , then cut the body into pieces of roughly the same size . When you have prepared all the fish , you can move on to the vegetables.
Peel the onions and cut them in half first and then into coarse pieces. Coarsely chop the orange, without removing the peel , and the celery .
Clean the fennel and set aside the scraps , then chop it the same way . Place the fennel scraps in a tall, large pot along with half of the celery and onion .
Add the gurnard head and the monkfish tail , then cover with water . Bring to a boil and cook for 45 minutes from when the water starts boiling . You should get about 8 cups of stock.
When the stock is ready, you can proceed with the soup preparation: pour the remaining vegetables and the orange into a large wide pot , then add the powdered and thread saffron and the fennel seeds .
Add the basil and the peeled tomatoes that you have previously crushed with a ladle , then place the fish inside the pot .
Cover with about 6 cups of stock and salt to taste. Bring to a boil and let it cook on high heat for about 25 minutes; the boil should be very lively. After this time, lower the flame, place the mantis shrimp in the pot , and continue cooking for another 20 minutes; in this phase, the liquid should simmer.
In the meantime, prepare the rouille sauce: in a tall, narrow glass, put the garlic cloves with the cores removed , the crumbled bread crumb , and the chopped chili pepper with the seeds removed .
Add 1/2 cup of cold stock and begin blending with an immersion blender , then add the egg yolk .
Salt and continue emulsifying by pouring in the oil in a thin stream, as if making mayonnaise , until you obtain a creamy and homogeneous consistency .
When the soup is cooked, turn off the heat and let it rest for 5 minutes. At this point, gently remove the fish from the pot using a slotted spoon , then strain the broth . Serve the fish with the hot strained broth in a serving pot and accompany your bouillabaisse with rouille sauce and slices of toasted bread !
It is recommended to consume the bouillabaisse immediately.
You can vary the ingredients depending on availability by choosing other soup fish such as scorpionfish, blackbelly rosefish, or weever. Bluefish is not suitable because it cooks too quickly.
As an alternative to the monkfish, you can use John Dory, sea bream, turbot, or dentex.
Regarding shellfish, you can also use shrimp or scampi, but in this case, you should add them towards the end of cooking because they are more delicate.
Some recipes suggest placing the pot with the fish, vegetables, and peeled tomatoes in the refrigerator for a few hours to better blend the flavors of the bouillabaisse!
