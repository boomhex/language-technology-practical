Once ready , transfer them to a plate, season with salt , and immediately serve the cordon bleu with air fryer .
We recommend consuming the cordon bleu with air fryer immediately, to enjoy the crispy breading and the melty filling. If you have leftovers, store them in the fridge and consume them within a couple of days.
Cordon bleu is lightly greased before cooking to prevent the breading from drying out excessively, you can also use a spray bottle to mist the oil.
We used medium-thick slices, using thinner slices could shorten the cooking time.
