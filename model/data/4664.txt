instructions:
Anolini are a first course dish from the Parma tradition, a true comfort food that encapsulates the genuine flavor of homemade cooking. Their preparation is long and meticulous, but the result rewards every effort: small parcels of fresh egg pasta that envelop an intensely flavored filling, cooked in a warm and fragrant Capon broth . The filling is the heart of the recipe, prepared with a dense cooking base created by the slow cooking of beef in broth and red wine. This sauce is then combined with Parmesan and breadcrumbs to achieve a tasty and perfectly textured stuffing. Anolini are prepared for holidays or big occasions, ideal for a family lunch or with friends, bringing the warmth of tradition to the table.

To prepare anolini, first cut the celery and carrots into pieces. Cut the onions in half and pierce them with cloves .
Place the vegetables and capon in a pot. Cover with water and cook over low heat, with a gentle simmer, for at least 1 hour.
Occasionally skim off the foam that forms on the surface to keep the broth clearer. Remove the meat and vegetables, strain the broth into another pot, and keep warm . In a cast-iron pot, pour the oil .
Add the beef and brown all sides . Remove the meat, add more oil, the cut vegetables , and sauté for a few minutes.
Return the meat to the pot , add 2 cups of capon broth and the red wine .
Add the cloves , cover with a lid , and cook over medium-low heat for 4-5 hours, making sure to turn the meat occasionally to keep it submerged. You should end up with a reduced, very dense cooking base. If not, cook over high heat for a few minutes without the lid.
Remove the meat, which will not be used for the anolini: it makes an excellent main dish accompanied by a simple salad or grilled vegetables. Strain the rest through a sieve into a bowl , you should obtain about 7 oz. From the bread, remove the breadcrumbs . Add the Parmesan to the cooking base .
Also add the breadcrumbs and mix to combine everything. Then add the egg and nutmeg .
Mix to obtain a homogeneous mixture and set aside. To prepare the fresh pasta, arrange the flour in a mound and pour the beaten eggs into the center . Add a pinch of salt .
Gradually incorporate the flour with a fork and then knead with your hands until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough ball. Cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 20 minutes .
In the meantime, take 1/4 oz of filling at a time and form small balls , placing them on a tray as you make them . Take the dough again, divide it in half .
Flatten each dough portion and fold the sheet to pass it through a roller . Continue to pass the dough through the machine, decreasing the thickness each time, until you achieve two sheets of 1/16 inch thickness . Cut them in half .
Place the filling balls on one half, about 1 1/4 inches apart , cover with the other half , and cut the anolini with the appropriate cutter or a round cutter with a diameter of 1 1/2 inches.
As you make them, place them on a tray covered with lightly floured parchment paper . You will obtain about 60 anolini. Cook the anolini in the capon broth for a few minutes. Serve and top with grated Parmesan. Your anolini are ready to be enjoyed .
We recommend consuming the cooked anolini immediately. For longer storage, it is possible to freeze them raw: arrange them on a tray without overlapping, and once solidified, transfer them into food bags. This way, they will last up to 2-3 months. When cooking, plunge them directly into boiling broth without thawing. The capon broth can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days or in the freezer for up to one month.
To obtain a less fatty broth, you can strain it through paper towels, so some fat will remain on the paper. For a dryer alternative, you can cook the anolini in melted butter and sage.
