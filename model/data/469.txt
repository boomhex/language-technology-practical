instructions:
To make pancakes without milk, add the egg and sugar to a bowl , then add room temperature water and stir with a hand whisk to mix the ingredients well .
Add the sifted flour and baking powder , then mix again .
You should obtain a smooth, lump-free batter . Heat a non-stick pan and pour a couple of tablespoons of batter into the center . Let it cook over low heat until bubbles form .
At this point, flip the pancake to the other side and cook for another minute . As they cook, stack the pancakes on a plate and continue this way until you finish all the batter; with these amounts, you will get 12 pancakes with a diameter of about 3 inches. Serve your pancakes without milk while still hot, accompanied by fruit and sauces to taste !
It's best to eat pancakes without milk immediately. Alternatively, you can store them in the refrigerator for up to one day, covered with plastic wrap.
If you want, you can prepare the batter the night before and store it in the refrigerator.
If you prefer to omit the baking powder, you can separate the egg yolk from the white and beat the white until stiff, then fold it into the mixture gently with upward movements.
