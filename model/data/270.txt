instructions:
To prepare the air fryer salt cod, first remove the skin from the cod , then cut the fillet into slices about 1.5 inches . Finally, remove the bones with tweezers .
Break the eggs into a bowl, add salt , and beat with a fork . Also add the pepper .
Dip the cod fillets into the egg mixture , then coat them with breadcrumbs and place them on a tray .
Drizzle the breaded cod fillets with a little oil on both sides . Place them in the air fryer basket (we used a fryer with a 6-liter capacity) and cook at 356°F for a total of 15 minutes .
After 10 minutes, turn the fillets over and continue cooking for another 5 minutes on the other side . Once cooked, serve your air fryer salt cod with a sprinkle of pepper and sea salt flakes !
It is recommended to consume the air fryer salt cod immediately. If necessary, you can store it in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
If you're looking for a dipping sauce, you can serve the Fried Cod with Avocado Cream or simple mayonnaise!
