That gentle soft bite sets diamantini cookies apart from every other treat on the table—these gluten free cookies made with rice flour show off their sweet side and bring something a little special, especially when families want a change from usual American cookie recipes. Golden brown and a little sparkly with cinnamon sugar, the nice look of these cookies just makes people want to grab one. Kids spot the familiar sprinkle and grown-ups notice the light, slightly chewy inside (especially moist and always a little fluffy ). Packed onto a holiday tray or brought to afternoon tea, their simple look says "classic cookie" while the taste feels warm and great . Often, people mention how thoughtful a plate of these is, since they’re not only delicious but actually fit those gluten and dairy free needs most busy families run into now. The cinnamon and sugar on top? Just DELICIOUS for coffee breaks, friendly get-togethers, or tucking into lunch boxes...and nobody feels left out around the table.
Families with busy schedules don’t have time for specialty snacks every week, so seeing gluten free cookies that really deliver on taste (and have that nice chewy inside) is a big win - you just drop them on a platter and things instantly look more festive. Whether using them as party favors, packing school snacks, adding them to a big brunch spread, or dressing up dessert after a casual meal, these always get people talking. Try mixing in your own fun ideas— baking variations for sure, like adding nuts or boosting cinnamon sugar (kids love customizing). These really let home cooks keep reliable, tasty cookie choices in rotation, even if someone’s new to gluten free baking, since rice flour cookies feel familiar and safe. Simple, classic, and truly good with that slightly crisp edge, Diamantini cookies fit all kinds of modern food needs. REMARKABLY flexible, inclusive, with proven appeal at family events—no matter how you serve them, these cookies invite everyone in for another round. Great proof that a sweet, old-school cookie (inspired by some snickerdoodle recipe favorites) can bring people together and keep snack time EASY.
To prepare the diamantini, grate the zest of 1 untreated lemon. Then in the bowl of a stand mixer, add the cold butter from the fridge cut into pieces , and add the sugar
start mixing the ingredients with the paddle attachment , then add the eggs and the grated lemon zest .
Then also add the rice flour and continue to mix the dough with the mixer for another couple of minutes. Transfer the dough to a work surface , form a loaf, and divide it into 5 equal pieces (about 4.23 oz each);
shape them into logs about 3/4 inch in diameter and place them on a tray . Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate to firm up for about 30 minutes.
Once ready, take them out of the refrigerator and prepare two trays. In one, spread the granulated sugar and roll 1 or 2 of the logs to adhere the sugar to the surface . Then cut the diamantini, discs about 3/8 inch thick .
Place them well spaced on a greased and parchment-lined baking sheet and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 10-12 minutes (320°F for about 4-6 minutes if using a fan oven; they should not darken too much; you can also bake a few at a time to better adjust time and temperature). Meanwhile, coat the remaining logs with cocoa: in a bowl, mix the sifted unsweetened cocoa powder with the granulated sugar , spread it on a tray, and roll the logs of dough in it .
Coat the entire surface well so that the cocoa and sugar adhere , then cut into discs about 3/8 inch thick and place them on a greased and parchment-lined baking sheet, well spaced . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 10-12 minutes (if using a fan oven, 320°F for about 4-6 minutes; you can also bake a few at a time to better adjust time and temperature).
Store the diamantini with rice flour in a glass container or tin box for 6 to 7 days.
The raw dough can be frozen for about 1 month wrapped in plastic wrap, then thaw in the refrigerator when needed.
Even if they seem a little soft, the cookies should not bake in the oven longer than the specified time because they will harden once out of the oven. Try baking four or five cookies to decide the ideal baking time for your oven.
