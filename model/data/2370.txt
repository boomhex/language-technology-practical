instructions:
To prepare vermicelli with onion and bacon sauce, start by cleaning the onions , then thinly slice them into rings . In a non-stick pan, heat the oil and melt the butter over low heat ,
then add the onions , season with salt and sugar , and let them cook, still over low heat, for 30-40 minutes, so the onions soften; if necessary, you can add a few tablespoons of water during cooking.
When the onions are almost cooked, cut the bacon into strips and cook them in a non-stick pan, letting them sear over high heat for a few moments to make them crispy and finally add them to the onions (save a few pieces of bacon to garnish the dish).
Wash, dry, and pick the thyme and marjoram leaves , tear the leaves with your hands and add them to the sauce (save a small amount for final presentation). Meanwhile, cook the pasta in boiling salted water .
When the pasta is cooked al dente, drain it, and add it directly to the pan with the onion and bacon sauce and let it cook for a few moments over high heat to enhance the flavor. Once ready , you can serve and garnish with the reserved bacon, thyme, and marjoram , then you can enjoy your vermicelli with onion and bacon sauce while still hot.
It is recommended to consume the vermicelli with onions and bacon immediately, but if you prefer, you can store it for up to 1 day in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap. Freezing is not recommended.
At the end of cooking, you can let the onions sizzle over high heat to caramelize them. For a sweeter flavor, use spring onions; if you want to intensify the taste, try deglazing with wine vinegar.
