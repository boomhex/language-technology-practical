instructions:
To prepare the chicken breast with peppers and olives, first cut the chicken breast into two parts and remove the bone and any fatty and stringy parts . Place the two pieces on a baking dish and season both sides with salt, oil , and black pepper.
Also season with sweet paprika and massage the chicken well . Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the fridge while you continue with the recipe .
Wash the vegetables, cut the peppers in half, remove the filaments and seeds inside , and cut them into strips . Cut the cherry tomatoes in half .
Finely chop the shallot . Now, take a large pan, pour a drizzle of oil, and add the shallot . Sauté for about 5 minutes over low heat. Add the peppers (yellow and red, or only yellow by doubling the amount), and cook for about 10 minutes .
Add the cherry tomatoes . Salt and pepper, season with marjoram leaves , and let cook over low heat for about 10-15 minutes. At the end of cooking, adjust the salt if necessary .
Take another non-stick pan. Pour a drizzle of oil and heat well. Brown the chicken breasts on both sides . Transfer them into the pan with the peppers and tomatoes, cover with a lid , and cook for about 15-20 minutes, checking the cooking and turning the chicken 4-5 times. The lid helps prevent the chicken breast from drying out; if it does, add a little water.
At the end of cooking, also add the olives , and the chicken breast with peppers and olives is ready to be served .
It can be stored in the fridge for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
To reduce cooking time, simply cut the chicken breast into strips, thus creating chicken strips.
