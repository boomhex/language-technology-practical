instructions:
To prepare pasta with chickpeas, mussels, and burrata, start by cleaning the mussels. Remove the beard and clean the shell well , then rinse them under running water. At this point, proceed with opening them: pour a drizzle of oil and a garlic clove into a pan and let it sauté over medium heat. Add the cleaned mussels and increase the heat until they start to open. Add a ladle of water .
Cover with a lid and cook until all the mussels are open . Use a slotted spoon to lift the mussels .
Transfer them to a bowl and strain the cooking water , collecting it in another bowl .
Take plenty of parsley and chop it finely . Now shell all the mussels . In a pot, pour a drizzle of oil and a garlic clove and let it sauté for a few minutes over medium heat, add the drained precooked chickpeas and let them roast for about 5 minutes.
Now pour the pasta and add all the mussel water . Remove the garlic .
Let it cook over medium heat until the pasta is done, stirring often and adding a few ladles of water if necessary . At the end of cooking, the pasta should be very creamy but not soupy. Adjust with salt and pepper . Now add the mussels .
Add the previously chopped parsley . Mix well and transfer to plates. Add the burrata on top and serve.
Pasta with mussels, chickpeas, and burrata can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day. We recommend adding the burrata only at the last moment.
Add a spicy note to the dish: add a chopped chili pepper during the cooking of the chickpeas!
