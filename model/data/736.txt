Montanarine with burrata and smoked salmon? So good. Seriously, these are a hit in Campania , especially around Naples. And people there just love their Italian fried pizza . And listen, these little rounds of pizza dough are fried to golden perfection—crispy on the outside but tender inside. Really amazing textures, you know?
Here's the deal: What sets this montanarine recipe apart is the topping. Creamy burrata and slices of smoked salmon. I mean, the burrata melts right into that warm fried dough—super moist and rich—and the smoked salmon adds this tangy pop. Keeps things really really fresh. In Campania, classic toppings like tomato and cheese are the norm, but this combo? Way way better. When you serve fried montanarine with burrata and smoked salmon, people get so excited. It's a little different, which is great.
These snacks are inspired by Neapolitan street food. Seriously good stuff like pizzelle fritte, popular for snacks or appetizers. And the dough? Just like what you'd find in a real Neapolitan pizzeria—keeping it real with authentic Italian cuisine . But hey, the blend of burrata and salmon gives them a fresh twist. Some folks add extras like basil, lemon zest, or a sprinkle of capers. But to be honest, the basic version with the creamy cheese and silky salmon is already super special.
You get this light, sweet flavor from the dough paired with the salty, smoky taste of the fish. And look, all in a bite-sized treat that's perfect as traditional Italian appetizers . For anyone who loves finger food that's easy to share, these montanarine are a big win. Perfect for celebrations or just hanging out with friends.
