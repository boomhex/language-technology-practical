instructions:
To prepare the zucchini rolls in puff pastry, wash the zucchinis and remove the stem . Then cut them in half and slice them very thinly ; also finely slice the scamorza with a mandoline .
Take the rectangular puff pastry roll and cut strips about 2 inches wide with a smooth-bladed pasta cutter . Lay the zucchini slices so that the rounded part slightly overhangs the pastry , then also lay the scamorza slices, ensuring they stay within the pastry edges; salt and pepper to taste .
Roll each pastry on itself and brush the end of the strip with egg white to better seal the roses .
Once all the roses are ready , place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for about 40 minutes (or 320°F for 30 minutes in a convection oven). Once cooked, remove from the oven and let the zucchini rolls in puff pastry cool on a rack .
Store the zucchini rolls in puff pastry under a glass dome for 1-2 days. They can be frozen if you used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
Instead of scamorza, you can use slices of prosciutto, cooked ham, or speck if you prefer!
