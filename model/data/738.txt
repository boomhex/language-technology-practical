When winter's chill hits Northern Italy, pumpkin pasta really becomes the star at dinner. Seriously good stuff. At Cascina Vittoria, chef Giovanni Ricciardella makes the pumpkin shine by slow-cooking it in parchment paper—really seals in those tender and moist flavors. It's both sweet and earthy. And listen, this dish is all about simplicity. Just a few seasonal ingredients really show off the heart of Italian winter cooking. And no heavy cream needed here. And you get that homey, comforting feel with each bite. Perfect for chilly days when you crave something hearty.
What really sets this pumpkin pasta recipe apart? The homemade scallion oil . It's amazing. The scallions are gently cooked until their sharp aroma is released, then blended into an oil that seeps right into the pasta. Your kitchen fills with a crispy, savory smell. Not your typical store-bought oil—it's fresh and green and really packs a punch. Pair it with the golden pumpkin, and you've got a dish that's rich, but not heavy. In regions like Lombardy and Piedmont, they focus on seasonal produce—this pasta is a prime example. No need for anything fancy. Just quality ingredients, patience, and a bit of skill. Truthfully, this recipe offers a break from the usual tomato sauces or cheese-heavy dishes. A really good break. It's an ideal vegetarian main that feels special yet is pretty simple to prepare. Each forkful is creamy, tangy, and packed with flavors that let each ingredient shine.
Whether hosting a dinner or enjoying a quiet night in, this dish brings a taste of Northern Italy right to your table. For real, it captures the true spirit of Italian cooking. It's a must-try for anyone eager to savor authentic seasonal flavors with that Italian touch. Can't go wrong.
