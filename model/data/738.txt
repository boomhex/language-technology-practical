instructions:
To prepare tagliatelle with cuttlefish and mushrooms, start by cleaning the porcini mushrooms. Scrape the stem of the mushrooms with a small knife , and wipe the cap with a piece of damp paper to remove excess dirt. It's best to minimize the contact of porcini with water. At this point, separate the caps from the stems . Cut the stems into small cubes .
Slice the caps into thin strips . Now prepare the cuttlefish, which for convenience are already cleaned, otherwise you can follow the guide on the website How to clean cuttlefish . Separate the tentacles from the body . Chop the cuttlefish tentacles .
Cut the rest lengthwise into strips . Pluck a few sprigs of thyme to use during the final cooking stage. Heat a little olive oil very well in a pan, add the rosemary sprig and the garlic clove , then add the chopped cuttlefish tentacles .

Also add the porcini cubes . Sauté well on high heat for about 5 minutes. Remove the garlic and rosemary , add a generous ladle of water , and adjust the salt.

Add the rest of the mushrooms . Meanwhile, cook the pasta, which you will drain al dente directly into the pan . Finish cooking the pasta by adding the rest of the cuttlefish .
Also add some cooking water, as needed . Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and the plucked thyme . The tagliatelle with cuttlefish and mushrooms are ready .
It is recommended to consume the tagliatelle with cuttlefish and mushrooms immediately to maintain the texture. If needed, you can store it for one day in the refrigerator in a closed container.
