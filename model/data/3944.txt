It’s absolutely DELICIOUS, and most home cooks agree it’s a classic family favorite for both its taste and the easy success it brings.
First, clean the eel thoroughly by cutting off its head and tail end and removing the entrails. Cut the capitone into pieces about 2 inches long, without removing the skin, and chop the cherry tomatoes. Cook the tomatoes in a pan with just a little oil, a sprig of basil, and a pinch of salt for about 40 minutes, then pass them through a sieve and set the sauce aside. At this point, heat some oil in a skillet and add the finely chopped onions and a handful of parsley, also chopped. Now add the eel pieces and let them brown for about 5 minutes after seasoning them with salt and pepper. Pour the white wine over the capitone, and once it has evaporated, add the previously prepared tomato sauce and cook for 15 minutes over moderate heat, stirring occasionally. Once ready, place your stewed eel on a serving platter and serve it hot.
What is capitone? Perhaps few know that this is how the large female eel is called in the southern regions, having reached the peak of its development and thus much larger than the male.
It is essential to remember that the eel must be purchased alive and killed only a few hours before cooking: unless you are in "killer mode: on," you can arrange a last-minute pick-up and let your fishmonger do it. :)
But let's move on to the presentation of the dish. First of all, the serving platter: a winning idea could be to lay the eel (and its wonderful sauce) on a few slices of toasted rustic bread, unforgettable! Then, the wine: undoubtedly white, full-bodied, and dry.
