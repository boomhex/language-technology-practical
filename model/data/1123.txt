instructions:
To make thumbprint cookies, first pour the sugar and the egg into a bowl and whisk with electric beaters. Add the softened butter and when you get a smooth mixture
incorporate the flour one spoonful at a time and, while continuing to mix with the beaters, also add the cocoa . The mixture will be quite compact , you can continue working with the beaters or by hand in the bowl.
Once compacted, transfer the dough onto a work surface , wrap it with plastic wrap and let it firm up in the fridge for 30 minutes. After the resting time, take the dough and break off small portions of 0.5 oz each .
Coat each ball with sugar , then make a slight indentation in the center with your thumb to create a cavity .
Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper : you will get 24 with these amounts. Bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 15 minutes. Once baked, remove the cookies and let them cool on a rack .
Prepare the ganache: chop the dark chocolate , heat the cream in a saucepan and then pour in the chocolate and mix with a spatula .
When the chocolate is completely melted and you have obtained a smooth sauce , fill the cookies . Allow the ganache to cool and then serve your cookies .
The cookies can be stored for 2-3 days under a glass dome. Do not store in the fridge as they do not tolerate moisture.
The fridge step is essential for thumbprint cookies to maintain their shape during baking. You can fill the cookies with melted chocolate and chopped nuts.
