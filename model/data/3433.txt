Start the preparation of the appetizers by cleaning the asparagus following the instructions found here (Cooking School "clean asparagus"). Then cook the asparagus using the special "asparagus pot" . Fill the asparagus pot about 2/3 full with water and cook the asparagus until they are tender. The tips, which remain out of the water, should cook with only steam. Once cooked, blend them in a mixer , adding a teaspoon of oil if needed to thicken the cream.
Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper and set aside the cream obtained . Lightly brown a clove of garlic in a pan with two tablespoons of olive oil, add the scallops and cook them for 1 minute on each side , then salt them. Meanwhile, squeeze the grapefruit and lemon and season the scallops with the juice obtained . At this point, assemble the appetizers: take a crunchy olive puff pastry, cover it with a teaspoon of asparagus cream, and place a scallop on top, finally garnish with grated grapefruit zest.
