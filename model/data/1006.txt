instructions:
For the sashimi, we start with cleaning the sea bass. We got it already gutted, headless, and scaled. To obtain the 5 oz of sea bass needed for the recipe, you can purchase a fillet or take the necessary part from the sea bass as follows: after removing the head, gutting, and scaling the fish, turn the fish's belly towards you and cut so as to reach the tail, following the central bone . Then proceed with a cut along the fish's back, above the fin . Then place the fish's tail to your right and make the same cut above the fin, from the tail towards the head. Cut to the base of the tail to obtain a fillet .
Turn the sea bass with the flesh resting on the cutting board and make the same cut to also obtain the second fillet . Clean the top fillet by removing the outermost part , remove any bones with tweezers if present .
Remove the skin by sliding the blade between the flesh and the skin itself, starting from the tail . Pass the fillet in a bowl with water, ice, and fine salt , rub it gently with your hands to remove excess fat.
Carefully blot with a dry disposable cloth . Now you can cut 10 slices of sea bass, each about 0.5 oz. You will need to cut diagonally, against the grain . Also cut 10 slices from the tuna
and from the salmon fillet, always slices of the same thickness and weight . For each serving plate, you can place 2 slices of each type of fish on the daikon. Also on each serving plate, you can add fresh wasabi, kizami wasabi, and wakame seaweed. Your sashimi is ready to be consumed immediately .
Sashimi should be consumed as soon as it's ready.

You can enrich the sashimi plate with 0.5 oz of wakame seaweed soaked in 4 cups of cold water for 4 minutes.
You can cut the daikon in half, slice it, and then into strips.
Also add freshly grated wasabi and kizami wasabi.
You can vary the types of fish: bream, octopus, crustaceans, salmon roe... the rule is always to create a colorful and aesthetically pleasing plate, which is obviously also good!


Before consuming raw, marinated, or not perfectly cooked fish, it is recommended to freeze it for at least 96 hours at 0°F in a domestic freezer marked with 3 or more stars, as per Ministry of Health guidelines .
