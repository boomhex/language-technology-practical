An ancient Milanese tradition involves keeping a piece of panettone from the Christmas holidays to eat on February 3rd in honor of Saint Blaise. Inspired by this unusual custom, we have created a recycling recipe that tastefully recovers the slices of panettone jealously preserved: panettone bruschettas with gorgonzola and red currants, an easy and luscious appetizer that can be served in a few minutes. Torn between sweet and savory, we chose to stop halfway by offering a combination of sweet and sour flavors to experiment with a new way of enjoying panettone!

To make the panettone bruschettas with gorgonzola, first cut the leftover panettone into thick slices . Heat a grill and toast the panettone slices for a few moments , just until they are golden .
Remove the rind from the gorgonzola, cut it into cubes and place it in a bowl, also add the mascarpone and work the cheeses with an electric mixer at low speed to obtain a thick cream . Spread the cream on the toasted panettone slices using a spatula .
Garnish with red currants and balsamic vinegar glaze . The panettone bruschettas with gorgonzola and red currants are ready to be enjoyed .
We recommend consuming the panettone bruschettas with gorgonzola immediately. You can prepare the cream a few hours in advance and store it in the fridge, so you can assemble the bruschettas just before serving.
Alternatively, you can garnish the bruschetta with chestnut honey for a robust and intense flavor instead of the glaze.
