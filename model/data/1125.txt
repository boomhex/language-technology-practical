instructions:
To make the piconi from Marche, pour the flour, eggs , and oil into a bowl. Knead well with your hands until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough.
Transfer it to a work surface , form a loaf and cover it with plastic wrap . Let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. In the meantime, prepare the filling: pour the eggs and lemon zest into a bowl .
Add the grated Parmesan and pecorino , mix to combine, and finally season with salt and pepper .
Take the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin to about 1/16 inch thickness . Cut strips about 4 inches wide . Place a tablespoon of filling (about 0.7 oz) shaped into a ball with your hands at intervals of about 2 inches .
Fold the dough over itself to cover the filling , then use a fluted pastry cutter to cut 'ravioli' about 3 inches in length and 2 inches in width . With these amounts, you will get about 30 ravioli. Place the piconi on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper .
Brush the surface with the egg and milk mixture and use a pair of scissors to cut the surface, making an 'x' . Bake in a static oven at 350°F for about 25 minutes. When cooked, remove the piconi from the oven and let them cool slightly before enjoying them .
Store the piconi from Marche in an airtight container for a couple of days. You can freeze them after baking.
Some variations see piconi in the shape of a half-moon and also include parsley in the filling.
