instructions:
To make lemon chicken , start by grating the peel , squeezing and filtering the juice of a lemon.
Now clean the chicken breast: cut the breast in half , remove the fattier parts and cut into strips , then into smaller pieces .
Now place the chicken in the flour and stir until thoroughly coated . Heat the olive oil in a pan ;
when nice and hot, add the chicken pieces and brown on a medium flame for around 5 minutes; turn them over occasionally until nice and brown. Remove from the heat and leave to one side.?Prepare the sauce: place the starch and water in a bowl .
Now add the sugar , the soy sauce and the lemon juice .
Add the resulting liquid to the same pan you browned the chicken in , leave to thicken for 1 minute, beat with a whisk and add the chicken .
Stir slowly and cook for 3-4 minutes. Once cooked, flavor with the lemon peel (19 ) and fresh oregano . Serve the lemon chicken nice and hot .
Store lemon chicken in the refrigerator and enjoy within 2 days. Freezing this dish is not recommended.
For an ethnic touch, add some finely chopped coriander or a little grated fresh ginger to your chicken and serve with some plain basmati rice.
If you don't want to use soy sauce, simple leave it out, but it does add an extra touch of sapidity and color to your lemon chicken!
