instructions:
There are several methods to clean mantis shrimp. Depending on the use, the method varies. First of all, in any case, you must wash the live shrimp under running water , being careful not to injure yourself with their spiny tails. To prepare pasta sauces or flavorful soups, it will be sufficient to cut them into pieces with a sharp knife. To cook them whole , you will need to make a cut along the dorsal shell so that the meat absorbs flavors more easily during cooking. If you wish, you can completely free the mantis shrimp from the dorsal shell, keeping only the meat, to make it easier for your guests or for particular preparations. In this case, to simplify the operations, dip them for just 2 minutes in a pot full of boiling water .
Drain the shrimp and let them cool slightly, then use sharp scissors to trim the ventral fins, starting from the bottom , and work your way up until they are all removed .
With the scissors, also remove the tips of the claws to avoid being pricked while handling them. Remove the portion of the dorsal shell that slightly protrudes along the side of the crustacean (8-9).
Also cut the tail , which has some spiny protrusions. With your right hand, hold the shrimp firmly on the work surface, and with your left, gently lift the dorsal shell, from the tail towards the head . This way, all the meat will be exposed .
Store the cleaned mantis shrimp for a maximum of 1 day in the refrigerator, wrapped in plastic wrap. If you prefer, you can freeze them for up to 2-3 months.
When purchasing, pay particular attention to the shell of the mantis shrimp, which should not have yellowish spots and should feel moist to the touch.
