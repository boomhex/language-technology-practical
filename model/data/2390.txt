To make the rice boats with red fruits, first, proceed with preparing the shortcrust pastry by mixing the rice flour with the sugar . Then add the eggs , a pinch of salt, the grated zest of an untreated lemon, and finally the seed oil .
Quickly mix everything with your hands until you obtain a compact and fairly elastic dough . Form a dough ball, wrap it in plastic wrap , and let it rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the custard: separate the egg whites from the yolks and collect the latter in a large bowl .
Then add the sugar and the seeds of a vanilla bean to the bowl. Beat all the ingredients vigorously with a whisk until you obtain a smooth cream. Then, heat the rice milk in a pan on the stove and, once heated, incorporate it slowly into the egg mixture .
After mixing the mixture well , put it back on the stove and add the agar-agar and rice flour .
Mix well with a spatula and let the mixture thicken . Then transfer the cream to a bowl
and let it cool with a sheet of plastic wrap in contact . Meanwhile, prepare the boats by greasing the molds with seed oil using a brush . Now proceed with distributing the shortcrust in the molds, shaping it with your fingers .
At this point, you will need to proceed with the blind baking of the shortcrust: cut out parchment paper discs to the size of the molds and place them on the shortcrust , then add ceramic spheres or dried beans . This way, the shortcrust will bake without puffing up. Bake the tartlets for about 20 minutes at 350°F in a preheated static oven (alternatively, you can bake in a fan oven at 320°F for 10 minutes). Once baked, remove the ceramic spheres, then the parchment paper, and bake again for about two minutes to also brown the bottom of the boats. Wait a few minutes to let them cool before unmolding them. At this point, transfer the now-cold rice cream into a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle ,
then decorate the tartlets with cream tufts and the red fruits after washing and drying them . For a glossy touch and to prevent the strawberries from oxidizing, take some strawberry jam and strain it into a saucepan ,
then slightly warm it up and brush the strawberries well . Finish with fresh mint leaves and serve your rice boats with red fruits .
You can store the red fruit tartlets in the refrigerator for 1 or 2 days covered with plastic wrap.
If you have leftover rice custard, store it in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap in contact for up to 12 hours.
It is not recommended to freeze the rice boats with red fruits.
