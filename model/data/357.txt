Cut them into diamonds about 5 mm thick . In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil, add the chicory , and sauté for a few minutes .
In a pot, pour a drizzle of oil, add the rice , and toast it for a few minutes, stirring occasionally. Wet with hot water and bring to cook, adding a ladle more if necessary and stirring. Once cooked, turn off the heat and add the butter .
Add the grated pecorino , plenty of pepper , and the chicory . Set aside some for the final decoration. Blend well.
Plate and finish with some chicory and a final sprinkle of pepper. Your risotto with pecorino and chicory is ready to be enjoyed !
It would be best to consume the risotto with pecorino and chicory immediately, but if there are leftovers, you can store it in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 1-2 days. To serve it again, heat it gently, adding a bit of hot broth or water to regain creaminess.
For an even bolder taste, you can replace the pecorino with sweet or spicy gorgonzola. For a more substantial version, you can add some cubes of smoked pancetta or sautéed guanciale.
