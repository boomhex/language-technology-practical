To make the cones with beef strips and crunchy vegetables, take the dough discs , roll them out on a work surface, place an aluminum cone 5 inches long, with a 1.2-inch wide opening , wrap the disc around the cone , seal it by pressing the edge with your fingers.
Then brush the entire surface with beaten egg . Place the cones on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake the cones in a static oven at 392°F for 10 minutes (or static at 356°F for 8 minutes) until the exterior is golden brown. Once baked, remove the cones from the oven and let them cool before gently removing the cone .
Wash the vegetables, trim the green beans and zucchini, and cut the zucchini into thin strips , peel the carrots and also cut them into strips . In a pan, heat 1.5 tablespoons of olive oil, brown a whole clove of garlic and then add the carrots, cook for 3-4 minutes
then add the green beans , continue cooking for another 3-4 minutes and finally add the zucchini , keep cooking the vegetables for a few minutes, they should remain crunchy .
Cut the beef into strips , coat them thoroughly in flour then remove the excess flour with a sieve . In another pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil,
then add the beef strips and brown them on all sides for 2-3 minutes, season with salt , pepper, and deglaze with balsamic vinegar ,
let it evaporate and then turn off the heat . Everything is ready to fill the cones: take a dough cone and fill the cavity with vegetables and beef strips using kitchen tongs . Your tasty cones with beef strips and crunchy vegetables are ready to be served .
You can store the cooked cones without filling under a glass dome for a couple of days. You can prepare the filling in advance and freeze it if you used fresh ingredients.
To ensure the cones' crunchiness, it is preferable to fill them just before serving. If you prefer white meat, you can replace the beef with chicken or turkey. You can also use puff pastry to make the cones.
