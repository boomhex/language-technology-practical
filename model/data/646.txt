To prepare the South Tyrolean Club Sandwich, first cut the apple in half , remove the core with a corer , and slice into thin pieces .
Now in a pan, add a pat of butter and, as soon as it melts, place the slices of bread inside . Toast them on both sides over high heat until golden brown.
Transfer the slices of bread to a cutting board . Slice the cheese and place it on only 4 of the 6 slices of bread. Place them back in the pan .
Cover with a lid , lower the heat, and let the cheese melt . Place the walnut halves on the melted cheese .
Add the slices of speck and apple slices . Drizzle a bit of honey on the apples .
Now place one filled slice of bread on top of another and cover with one of the two remaining slices of bread . Do the same for the second sandwich and serve your South Tyrolean Club Sandwich!
We recommend serving the South Tyrolean Club Sandwich immediately.
For an even tastier sandwich, you can spread some grain mustard on the slices of bread before assembling it.
