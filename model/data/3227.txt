Minne di Sant’Agata isn’t just any dessert—these Sicilian breast-shaped pastries are a real symbol of Catania. Every February, the city absolutely buzzes for Saint Agatha’s festival. And you know what? What makes these pastries stand out is their unique look: rounded to resemble a woman’s breast, with a cherry on top. And that’s not just for fun, it’s a tribute to St. Agatha, the city’s beloved patron. Seriously, it goes way back in history. Each one has a tender shortcrust shell filled with sweetened sheep ricotta , mixed with bits of candied fruit and dark chocolate. Every bite? A mix of creamy goodness and bursts of fruitiness. Once baked, they get this thick white icing that's a bit sweet but never over the top. And that glossy look? Really pops at festivals.
People all over Sicily, not just Catania, get super excited for these Saint Agatha’s breasts desserts . If you ever find yourself there in early February, you'll see how important they are. These Minne di Sant’Agata are more than just another treat—they're tied up with island history. Folks call them “minni’i’virgini,” and in some spots, they use another name: Cassatelle di Sant’Agata .
The inside is always moist and packed with flavor. That classic Sicilian ricotta, plus bits of dark chocolate, adds a little hit of richness. Pretty much perfect. The shortcrust? Gets kind of crispy on the edges after baking, which balances all the soft inside stuff just right. And listen, you’ll spot these pastries at bakeries and sweet shops everywhere in Sicily—especially during the festival. Young, old, visitors, locals—everyone wants a taste. If you’re into traditional Sicilian desserts , this is one you’ve gotta try. It’s not just about the flavor. It's the whole feeling of history, celebration, and city pride packed into one bite. For real, it's a must.
To prepare the Saint Agatha's breasts, knead the pastry ( Shortcrust pastry for more instructions): on a work surface, pour the flour that you have blended in a mixer with cold butter, add the powdered sugar, egg yolks (set aside the egg whites for the glaze), seeds from a vanilla bean and knead with your hands to obtain a homogeneous mixture. Wrap the pastry in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least half an hour .
Proceed with the filling preparation: cut the candied orange into pieces and chop the dark chocolate into flakes . Sift the ricotta very well by passing it through a sieve and
add the powdered sugar, also sifted , then mix the ingredients. Add the pieces of candied orange and chocolate ; finally, if you want a more fruity aroma, also add the grated zest of an orange. Mix everything to obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Take the pastry and roll it out with a rolling pin into a sheet about 1/4 inch thick and line semi-spherical molds with it (we used silicone molds with a diameter of 3 inches, capacity 1/2 cup), then fill them with about 2.8 oz of ricotta .
Roll out the remaining pastry, again to a thickness of 1/4 inch, and cut out a circle to seal the semi-spheres using a 3-inch diameter cookie cutter . Close the semi-spheres by gently pressing the edges (14-15).
Bake everything in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 20 minutes (fan oven 356°F for 15 minutes). When the Saint Agatha's breasts have browned on top, remove them from the oven and let them cool in the molds , then unmold them when they are completely cold (otherwise the hot filling will not hold). Place them on a rack and in the meantime prepare the glaze: beat the egg whites with an electric mixer or stand mixer ,
when the mixture is semi-whipped, add the powdered sugar one tablespoon at a time, and finally the lemon juice (19-20). The consistency of the glaze should not be too firm and glossy but should "write" , leaving a trail when falling from above.
Cover the Saint Agatha's breasts well with the glaze, letting it flow evenly over the dessert , then finish the decoration with a candied cherry placed on top of each dessert . Let dry on the rack to let the excess glaze fall off . The Saint Agatha's breasts are ready: they can be consumed when the glaze is still soft or let it dry completely .
Store the Saint Agatha's breasts in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, for 3-4 days. The cassatine can be frozen after baking and glazed after thawing.
Popular tradition tells that Saint Agatha was a beautiful girl, descended from a noble Catanian family, converted to Catholicism. The proconsul Quinziano fell in love with her and forced her to renounce her faith and worship pagan gods. The girl stubbornly refused and was thus martyred, suffering the violent tearing of her breasts. Saint Agatha was beatified after her death and today is revered as a patron saint in Catania, San Marino, and Malta.
Every recipe, as we know, lends itself to more or less significant variations. In this case, you can choose whether to respect the tradition or your taste: already excellent as it is, the cream can be flavored with a pinch of cinnamon or a dash of Marsala wine if you feel the absence. If you really can't find sheep's ricotta or don't like its pronounced flavor, you can replace it with cow's ricotta (keep the same quantities, please). Finally, the glaze: try and try again, I found this balance, but if you are used to working with more fluid glazes, add an egg white and mix vigorously.
