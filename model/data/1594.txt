instructions:
To prepare the creamy pasta, first place a pot full of salted water on the stove, and when it reaches a boil, add the pasta, cooking it for the time indicated on the package. In the meantime, prepare the sauce: finely chop the herbs: thyme, marjoram, rosemary, and sage . In a bowl, pour in the fresh spreadable cheese and season it with the herb mixture
and the grated Parmesan cheese . Thin it with the milk and mix everything with a spoon or spatula to blend the ingredients and flavors .
Pour the obtained cream into a large pan and soften it with a ladle of pasta cooking water . Stir and when the pasta is cooked, drain it directly into the pan .
Stir one last time to flavor the linguine . Serve the creamy herb pasta immediately, seasoning it with freshly ground pepper to taste and garnishing it with marjoram leaves .
We recommend consuming the creamy herb pasta immediately, otherwise it might dry out too much. Freezing is not recommended.
To make your creamy herb pasta, fresh cow's milk ricotta, well-drained from its whey, will also work well!
