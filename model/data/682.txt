So, you know, cordon bleu gets a whole new twist with this really cool take—using pork loin, Asiago DOP , and radicchio . Picture the classic cordon bleu recipe , but here’s the twist: instead of chicken and ham, you’ve got juicy pork loin wrapped around sautéed radicchio. And the radicchio? Gets a quick hit of raspberry vinegar to knock out any bitterness and add a little tangy kick. Honestly, that sharp vinegar really really works with the deep flavors of the radicchio and makes the whole thing feel kind of rich and cozy.
Perfect for colder months. Tucked inside, you’ll find a slab of Asiago DOP cheese that melts into a gooey center, giving every bite that awesome stretch and a mild, nutty flavor. Seriously good. It plays super well against the earthiness of the greens. The breading comes out extra crispy—like really really crispy—thanks to a quick fry, so you get this really nice crunch before hitting the moist and flavorful middle.
It’s a combo that's familiar and surprising. Pretty simple, but great for anyone who loves a classic but wants something that stands out a bit. Switching up ingredients like this shows how you can riff on a famous cordon bleu recipe just by changing the filling. And look, using pork makes it a bit more tender and hearty, while the radicchio and cheese bring in those strong tastes that folks love in winter.
The way the radicchio is cooked with the vinegar—total game-changer—makes it less bitter and more balanced. Really works with the rich cheese. This version feels like a special treat—no question—but it’s not hard to pull off. You'll look like you know your way around some serious flavor combos. You get all the best stuff: crispy on the outside, melting cheese on the inside, and that hint of tangy freshness from the greens.
Anyone who loves a good gourmet chicken dish or is searching for new Asiago cheese recipes will definitely want to give this a shot. It’s the kind of food that gets people talking and leaves everyone pretty happy at the table. For sure.
To prepare the cordon bleu with Asiago PDO and radicchio, start with the radicchio: cut it into quarters and then into strips . Place it in a pan with a drizzle of oil and cook for about ten minutes, allowing it to char well. At the end of cooking, salt and pepper .
Now deglaze with raspberry vinegar , stir, and turn off the heat . Let it cool slightly. Meanwhile, prepare the fresh Asiago PDO cheese. Cut it into slices 0.4 inches thick .
Then adjust the pieces so they can fit in the center of the pork loin slices . Lay the first slice of loin on a cutting board, place a bit of radicchio on top , and a piece of fresh Asiago PDO .
Cover with more radicchio, place another slice of loin on top , pressing the edges together well. Bread the cordon bleu by first passing it in the flour , then in the beaten egg .
Finally, pass it in the breadcrumbs . Pay attention to this step, sealing all the edges well so it doesn't open during frying. Prepare the others in the same way. Now for the frying. Submerge one cordon bleu at a time in plenty of preheated oil at 338°F .
Fry for a few minutes until it is golden and uniform. Drain the cordon bleu and transfer it to a tray with paper towels . Continue in this way, cooking the others. Serve your cordon bleu hot, accompanied by a radicchio salad .
We recommend consuming the cordon bleu immediately while they are hot. Alternatively, you can store them in the fridge for 1-2 days and reheat them before serving.
If you prefer, you can substitute the raspberry vinegar with apple cider vinegar or blueberry vinegar, which will still impart sweetness to the radicchio, softening its bitter taste.
