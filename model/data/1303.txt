instructions:
To make the duffins, first melt the butter in a saucepan and start preparing the dough: place the egg in a bowl and add the granulated sugar and brown sugar , then add the salt and the seeds from the vanilla bean and mix the ingredients with an electric mixer.
At this point, pour in the melted and cooled butter and the yogurt , and mix for a few seconds with the mixer to combine everything .
Add the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour , and baking powder , and mix again with the mixer to incorporate the dry ingredients and achieve a smooth batter .
Now take a muffin pan, line it with 8 paper liners, and fill each halfway with the batter . Add a teaspoon of jam and cover with the remaining batter .
Once ready , bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 30 minutes. When they are baked, remove them from the oven and let them cool . In the meantime, melt the butter for the garnish, and once the duffins have cooled, brush them with the melted butter .
Roll the duffins in granulated sugar to coat them entirely , then sprinkle with ground cinnamon : your duffins are ready to be enjoyed !
Duffins can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 days. They can be frozen after being baked and completely cooled.
If you like, you can replace the jam with hazelnut cream or Chocolate custard cream !
