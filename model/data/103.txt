instructions:
To make the tomato tartare in two textures with oyster gelée, start with the preparation of the confit cherry tomatoes: place the whole cherry tomatoes in a baking dish , then season with oil and butter .
Add the balsamic vinegar , honey , and salt flakes .
Finally, season with thyme and marjoram leaves . Shake the dish to distribute the seasoning well, then bake in a static oven at 320°F for about 2 and a half hours .
Now move on to the oysters: first, soak the gelatin sheets in cold water . Open the oysters with the appropriate knife , taking care to use gloves or a cloth to protect your hands, then remove the mollusk .
Filter the oyster water . Place the mollusks back into the shells , after cleaning them thoroughly and removing the part that attaches the mollusk to the shell. Keep aside 60 ml (about 2 oz) of oyster water for the jelly , and a couple of tablespoons for the tomato tartare.
Now pour the 60 ml (about 2 oz) of oyster water into a saucepan, add the vermouth , and bring almost to a boil. When it is about to boil, turn off the heat and add the drained and well-squeezed gelatin , then stir with a whisk to dissolve it completely .
Fill the shells complete with mollusk with the obtained liquid , then add a pinch of fennel and 3 pink peppercorns for each . Let it set in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
In the meantime, focus on the tomato tartare: cut the tomato first into slices and then into cubes . Finally, chop it with a knife .
Retrieve the confit cherry tomatoes that will now be cooked and also chop them finely . Desalt and chop the capers .
Remove the green part of the scallion, divide it lengthwise , and slice it thinly . In a bowl, combine the fresh tomato tartare with the confit cherry tomato tartare .
Add the scallion , then season with oil and the 2 tablespoons of reserved oyster water .
Finally, season with green Tabasco and capers , adjusting the amount based on the saltiness of the mixture. Mix well to combine everything .
You are ready to plate: create a bed of coarse salt at the base of the plate , then place 2 oysters on top ; this way they will stay in place. Use a small ring mold to add the tartare alongside the jelly inside each shell ; you can vary the quantities to create different taste experiences. Your tomato tartare in two textures with oyster gelée is ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the tomato tartare in two textures with oyster gelée immediately.
It is important to choose oysters of size 2 or 1, preferably from Normandy, as they have a larger and deeper shell capable of containing a greater amount of liquid.
If you can find it, you can use salted butter for the confit cherry tomatoes and omit the salt flakes.
