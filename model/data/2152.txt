Spaghetti salad with marinated egg offers a fresh twist on classic Italian summer meals. You know, instead of the usual cold pasta salads you might find at a picnic, this dish is something more creative. Really, really creative. The star? It's the firm, cured egg yolk on top, giving a punch of flavor and a texture that's both tender and rich. Italian home cooks often keep it simple, but this pasta salad with egg is the type you'd find on a menu when chefs want to impress—mixing old-school recipes with a modern twist. Which is great.
You still get those familiar ingredients—like juicy tomatoes, good olive oil, and fresh herbs. But then there's the cured yolk—seriously good—which melts into everything, adding a whole new layer. It's creamy without being heavy—making the salad taste extra special. Across Italy, especially during the hot months, people love a refreshing spaghetti salad served cold. And this version? Perfect for anyone into summer pasta recipes that push boundaries.
Thing is, the egg isn't boiled like a regular hard-boiled egg you'd see in a vegetable pasta salad; instead, it's cured. So, it becomes firm and almost golden in color—bringing a real pop of flavor. Food enthusiasts will appreciate how the marinated yolk balances with tangy Italian dressing and other fresh ingredients. It's the kind of dish that fits at a picnic or a fancy dinner, letting you explore both flavors and new ideas.
With every bite, you'll notice how the textures play off each other—the soft spaghetti, the crisp veggies, and that extra silky finish from the yolk. The marinated egg twist turns a simple salad into something that tastes bright, lively, and just a bit unexpected. Exactly what you want when trying something new, but still craving a taste of Italy. Really, whether you are hosting a gathering or simply looking to try something different at home, this dish is a great way to enjoy the best of Italian culinary creativity.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap , let the yolks marinate in the 4 bowls for 15 hours at room temperature. After the marination time, gently remove the surface marination of salt and sugar with a spoon, being very careful not to break the yolk . Remove all the yolks that will be firm, quickly and gently rinse them in a bowl with room temperature water . Then drain them and place them in a bowl in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Meanwhile, place a pot with plenty of water on the stove: it will be used to cook the pasta. Once it reaches a boil, salt it. In the meantime, wash the outer leaves of the cabbage, cut it in half, and then slice it thinly , peel the onion and slice it too , lastly, wash the cherry tomatoes and quarter them .
