To prepare the potato cream with cuttlefish, start with the cream: make the Vegetable broth with celery, carrot, and onion. Thinly slice the leek , peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes . Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a pan and gently soften the leek over low heat for 10-15 minutes ,
when it is softened, add the potatoes , cover them with the vegetable broth , and continue cooking, add salt, cover with a lid , and cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes.
Remove the stem from the peppers and take out the seeds, then cut them into thin strips . Take the cuttlefish and cut them into strips about 1/4 inch wide . If you bought cuttlefish that need cleaning, you will need to gut them and rinse them under running water. Grate the lemon zest
squeeze the juice from half . In a large pan, sauté the garlic clove to flavor the oil, add the peppers , and just soften them for a few minutes; they should remain crunchy. Remove the garlic clove with tongs and add the cuttlefish .
Flavor with thyme , with the lemon zest and juice , and stir with a spoon. Add salt and pepper and cook for a few minutes. Then turn off the heat .
Focus on the cream: transfer the cooked potatoes to a high-sided bowl and blend them with an immersion blender until you get a thick cream , add salt and pepper, and distribute the cream onto serving plates, placing the sautéed cuttlefish in the center. Drizzle with a little raw olive oil and immediately serve your potato cream with cuttlefish .
It is recommended to consume the potato cream with cuttlefish immediately. If there are leftovers, store the cream separately for 2-3 days and the sautéed cuttlefish for a maximum of 1 day. It is possible to freeze the two preparations separately if you have used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
Alternatively, or in addition to the peppers, you can use other vegetables like zucchini or eggplants for a different mix of colors! If the cream turns out too thick, dilute it with a ladle of broth.
