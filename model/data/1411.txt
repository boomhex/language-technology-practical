To make the apple crostini with bacon and cheese, first place the feta in chunks in a tall glass, pour the fresh cream and blend everything with an immersion blender to get a creamy mixture, add salt and pepper , and season with a little olive oil.
Now heat a pan and brown the bacon slices until they are nicely golden . Cut the slices into 3/4 inch pieces and set aside .
Now cut the chive stems that will be used to garnish the crostini . Wash the apples, cut them in half , remove the central core, and then slice them to get wedges about 3/8 inch thick .
Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a pan and cook the apple slices for a few minutes on both sides , they should remain crunchy .
Everything is ready to compose the snacks: take an apple slice, place some bacon on top , a teaspoon of feta cream , and finally, season with chives. Serve your apple crostini with bacon and cheese immediately .
We recommend consuming the apple crostini immediately.
If you don't like chives, you can flavor the cream with some thyme or marjoram leaves.
