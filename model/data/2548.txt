Tortiglioni pasticciati is about bringing the comfort of Piedmont right to your table, mixing the best of baked tortiglioni into a single, creamy delight. So, here's the thing: in northern Italy, this cheesy tortiglioni bake is what you crave when you want something rustic and rich. And those big, ridged tortiglioni noodles? They hold onto the sauce perfectly. Really, really well.
They're packed with tender guanciale, earthy champignon mushrooms, and radicchio—adding that hint of bitterness to keep things interesting. But honestly, the star here is the cheese. A blend of strong northern Italian cheeses like Asiago, Fontina, and especially Toma Piemontese—pretty much a local favorite—melts into a thick, almost gooey béchamel. Every bite? Comforting, with those deep, nutty flavors you only find in authentic Italian cooking.
What sets this dish apart is its layered build—baked until the top is golden and crispy. Piedmontese folks, they know how to craft a pasta casserole that's filling and full of character. The classic pairing of radicchio and Toma is a northern staple, while the guanciale? It adds a savory kick.
And listen, when you pull this tortiglioni pasta recipe from the oven, the aroma alone promises satisfaction—perfect for a chilly night or whenever you want something hearty. It's not your typical tortiglioni with marinara sauce ; this dish is all about big, strong taste with a crispy finish. Seriously good.
It's a popular choice for an easy oven-baked tortiglioni main course, especially since it stays warm and moist even after sitting out. Whether you're searching for weeknight tortiglioni dinner ideas or longing for a taste of genuine Piedmont tradition, this recipe really shows regional flavors in a way that's cozy, simple, and hard to beat. You'll enjoy the rich layers and show the true taste of northern Italy with every bite.
To prepare the messy tortiglioni, start with the How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms ; with a sharp knife with a smooth blade, begin to remove the earthy part on the stem , scraping it gently until any trace of soil is removed. If the mushrooms are quite clean, remove the few traces of soil with a brush or a cotton cloth (if they are still very dirty, pass them quickly under a jet of cold running water). Once cleaned, cut the whole mushrooms lengthwise and set aside.
Wash the radicchio under plenty of fresh water and cut it into strips . Also cut the pork cheek into strips , then brown it in a non-stick pan for 5-6 minutes. When the pork cheek is crispy and golden, add the mushrooms ;
deglaze with white wine and cook for 10 minutes on high heat, seasoning with salt to your taste. After the necessary time, turn off and also add the radicchio cut into strips , stirring with a spatula to soften it and to mix all the ingredients well . Meanwhile, put a large pot with plenty of salted water on the fire, which you will need for cooking the pasta.
When the pasta water is about to boil, cook the tortiglioni al dente . In the meantime, you can prepare the cheese béchamel: cut all the cheeses into strips , then heat the milk in a small saucepan .
Separately, melt the butter over low heat ; when the butter has melted, turn it off and add the sifted flour like rain , stirring with a whisk to avoid the formation of lumps. Then put it back on low heat and stir until it becomes golden: you will then have obtained the roux .
When the milk is about to boil, completely melt the cheeses in the boiling milk . Gradually add the milk and cheese mixture to the roux , stirring everything vigorously with the whisk. Cook for 5-6 minutes on low heat until the sauce thickens and starts to boil. At this point, turn off the heat and set aside.
After 12 minutes, the tortiglioni will be al dente: drain them and add them to the sauce you prepared earlier . Pour the cheese béchamel over the pasta , mixing with a spatula to combine everything well .
Distribute the tortiglioni in a baking dish and sprinkle with grated cheese . Brown the pasta in a preheated static oven at 446°F for 5-6 minutes until it becomes golden and crispy: take your messy tortiglioni out of the oven and serve them hot .
Store the messy tortiglioni in the refrigerator for up to 2 days in an airtight container. They can be frozen before baking if you have used fresh and not defrosted ingredients.
To make this dish, you can use a different type of pasta such as lumaconi or conchiglioni, which are especially ideal for holding a rich sauce. In your béchamel instead of Asiago, try gorgonzola or another type of cheese: the taste is guaranteed!
