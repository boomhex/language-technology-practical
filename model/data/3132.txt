If you're looking to mix up your burger game, this orange ginger tuna burger is a fresh, modern twist that brings Italian creativity to life. And look, instead of beef, you've got a tuna burger that's all about being light and tender. The star? Grated orange zest and ginger, mixed right into the patty. It gives you a citrus ginger tuna patty that’s both zesty and a little spicy. The orange zest really, really wakes things up, while the ginger adds a subtle kick.
Plus, to balance things out, there's a drizzle of sweet honey mustard sauce made with Italian acacia honey. Just the right amount of sweetness. So good. This burger blends classic Mediterranean ingredients with a hint of Asian flair, without going overboard.
The result? A lighter, fresher take on the usual burger vibe.
You'll find this kind of healthy seafood burger popping up on Italian menus as a creative alternative for those craving something different yet still crispy and satisfying. And here's the thing—it pairs beautifully with just about anything. A crunchy salad on the side or nestled in a bun with some fresh greens—pretty simple, right? The moist texture of the tuna patty really shines, especially when you get a bit of that tangy-sweet sauce in each bite.
Some cooks even sprinkle a little extra orange zest for an added punch of fresh aroma right before serving. While it might not hail from a specific region in Italy, it perfectly captures the laid-back, ingredient-focused style of modern Italian cuisine.
Whether you’re after a quick tuna burger recipe for a weeknight dinner or simply want to jazz up your burger routine, this ginger-infused seafood burger is a fun, delicious way to mix things up—without getting too heavy or complicated. Seriously good. It’s an ideal choice for anyone wanting to enjoy a tasty meal that’s both satisfying and refreshing. Pretty much.
To prepare the orange and ginger tuna burger, finely chop the tuna with a knife (alternatively you can chop the tuna in a food processor to speed up the process) and place it in a bowl, add the freshly grated ginger , the dill and chopped parsley .
Grate the orange zest to taste and add the mint , season with salt, and mix the ingredients to combine them. Now take a cutting board, place a sheet of parchment paper on top and place a 4-inch diameter pastry ring on top and fill it with the tuna mixture, making sure to press the mixture well with a spoon : the burger height should be about 3/8 inch.
Remove the pastry ring and you'll have your burger: brush it with oil to prevent it from sticking during cooking, and prepare 3 more or until the tuna mixture is used up. Then transfer the burger to a hot pan using the parchment paper to keep it compact , remove the paper and cook the burger in a very hot pan for no more than 1 minute per side. Once cooked, keep the tuna burger warm .
Now prepare the sauce: in a bowl, put the mayonnaise and mustard , mix the sauce and finally add the acacia honey . Serve the orange and ginger tuna burgers and sauce with fresh salads or stuff them into soft burger buns!
Store the tuna burger in the refrigerator in an airtight container for no more than one day. It is not recommended to freeze it if you use already defrosted tuna; if you use fresh tuna, you can freeze the burger raw.
If, like me, you are looking for the perfect cooking and love experimenting, know that you can also cook the burgers in the oven (350°F, static oven, 6-8 minutes at most, turning them halfway through cooking): whether you sear them in a pan or in the oven, the result should be the same, which is pink tuna inside and crispy outside. 
For a richer dough, you can add breadcrumbs. 
If, on the other hand, you want to vary the fish, you can replace the tuna with cod or swordfish.
