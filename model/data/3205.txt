instructions:
Tartiflette comes straight from the chilly region of Haute-Savoie in France. It's perfect for those cold nights. I mean, really. This French potato casserole is packed with layers of tender potatoes, soft onions cooked in white wine, and a generous amount of lardons or pancetta that adds a crispy and salty bite. But the real star here? The reblochon cheese —a creamy, rich, and melty delight that covers everything and seeps into the layers below. And here's the thing, Tartiflette is actually pretty new in the grand scheme of "traditional French recipes". It was whipped up in the 1980s by locals who wanted to showcase Reblochon, their prized cheese from the French Alps. Even so, it’s already a winter favorite. Brings a bit of mountain comfort to the table, especially after a long day.
In the Savoy region, tartiflette is often eaten as a whole meal, not just a side. Seriously hearty stuff. It’s usually served with a light salad to balance out all that cheesy goodness. And you know what? That little bit of fresh crunch really complements the rich, golden top of the casserole. The dish captures the rustic, down-to-earth vibe of Savoyard cuisine, where simple ingredients—potatoes, bacon, and cheese—turn into something way, way more than the sum of their parts. Plus, in the French Alps, this alpine comfort food pops up at ski lodges and family tables throughout winter. It offers a perfect mix of cheesy and tangy flavors.
So if you’re into a cheesy potato bake that feels kinda different from anything else you've tried, tartiflette deserves a spot on your table. It’s not just a meal—it’s the kind of winter casserole that makes you want to gather around with friends, dig in, and maybe enjoy a glass of white wine with those creamy bites. This blend of flavors and textures makes tartiflette not only a dish but an experience—brings people together, warming hearts and homes alike. Really really good.
To prepare the tartiflette, start by cooking the potatoes: we cooked them in salted water in a pressure cooker for 10 minutes . The potatoes should not be overcooked because the slices need to remain whole; if they cook too much, they will break when cut. While the potatoes are on the stove, prepare the onion: peel it and slice it finely into rings and cook it in a non-stick pan, over very low heat, in melted butter: it should slowly soften .
Deglaze the onion with the wine and continue cooking until the onion is very soft . In the meantime, set aside 16 whole slices of bacon, you will need 4 for each individual dish or all together for a single dish, and cut the remaining ones into strips of half an inch .
When the potatoes are cooked, let them cool completely and when they're cold, peel them and cut them into slices half an inch thick, being careful not to break them . Gently mix the potatoes, bacon, and stewed onion in a bowl and let them blend together .
Now prepare the Reblochon fondue: remove the outer rind from the cheese and melt it in a double boiler or microwave in a bowl . If you wish, once melted, add cream to the cheese , to make the cream more fluid.
Assemble the tartiflette: lightly oil 4 ceramic baking dishes (diameter of about 7-8 inches) and place 4 slices of bacon in each to form a cross, leaving half a slice outside the dish . You can also assemble the tartiflette in a single dish. Add the potatoes, seasoned with bacon and onion, until the dishes are filled (14-15).
Pour the Reblochon fondue over the potatoes , fold the bacon over the top of the dish and bake in a preheated static oven at 482°F for 13-15 minutes (fan 446°F for 10 minutes), until the surface is golden and crispy . Remove the tartiflette from the oven, let it cool for a couple of minutes, and enjoy!
You can store the tartiflette in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, and consume it within 3 days, reheating it in the oven. You can freeze the tartiflette, but without the cheese. The melted cheese should be added when the tartiflette is defrosted: at that point, proceed with cooking as indicated in the recipe.
Warm, melting, and utterly delightful: tartiflette is a wonderful dish you must try. However, before rushing to buy Reblochon, here are some tips to ensure everything goes smoothly. The potatoes: cut them only when they are completely cold, otherwise they break. The cooking: I used ceramic baking dishes, but if you have copper ones, even better. The Reblochon: try it to believe it. However, if you can’t find it, or it doesn’t suit your taste, tartiflette is equally delicious with Taleggio, which is more intense, or Brie, which is more delicate.
