instructions:
To prepare baby octopus with peas, first cut the fresh chili pepper into rings and peel the garlic. In a large pan, pour in the oil, the peeled garlic clove , the chili pepper , and sauté for a few seconds over high heat.
Then add the baby octopus and cook over high heat for 3-4 minutes, stirring often. Deglaze with the wine and let it evaporate, then add salt and pepper .
Cover with a lid and cook the baby octopus for about 75 minutes over low heat; the times depend greatly on the size of your baby octopus. After this time, remove the garlic clove and add the peas .
Continue cooking without the lid for another 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and flavor with mint leaves and grated lemon zest . The baby octopus with peas is ready, just serve it up !
The baby octopus with peas can be stored in the refrigerator for at least 2-3 days. They can also be frozen if you have used fresh ingredients.
Keeping in mind the long cooking time required for preparation, you can prepare the baby octopus the day before, without the peas, and finish cooking before serving.
