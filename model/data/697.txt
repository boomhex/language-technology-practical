instructions:
To prepare the cocoa and almond ring cake with red fruit sauce, start with the batter. In a bowl, mix the two flours with the cocoa and the packet of baking powder . Separately, in another bowl, pour the eggs and brown sugar . Beat the ingredients with an electric mixer until the eggs are fluffy and light. It will take about 5 minutes.
With the mixer still running, add the oil in a stream and once it's well absorbed, add the milk . Now reduce the speed of the beaters and also add the sifted dry ingredients directly into the bowl .
Once the batter is ready, take a large 9-10 inch ring cake mold, butter it, and dust it with cocoa . Transfer the batter inside and level it with a spatula. Bake in a preheated static oven at 320°F for 45 minutes. Always perform the toothpick test before removing the cake from the oven, and then let it cool. At this point, prepare the sauce. In a saucepan, pour the berries, water, and brown sugar .
Cook for about ten minutes , blend with a hand blender , and strain to remove the seeds .
Once cool, turn the ring cake out onto a plate , pour the red fruit sauce on top , and decorate with almond flakes and berries .
The ring cake can be stored under a glass dome for 2-3 days. We recommend adding the sauce only when serving.
To add a touch of extra color, decorate the ring cake with small meringues.
