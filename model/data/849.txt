Ravioli with rice and cheese is a beloved dish from the gorgeous hills of Piedmont, especially in the Langhe area. And here's the thing, known locally as 'ravioli ris e coi,' this traditional dish has been cherished for generations. What sets this ravioli with rice and cheese apart is its tender filling. Really, it's rice cooked gently in milk with cabbage, creating a mild and creamy delight. Unlike the popular Ravioli del Plin, which includes meat, this version just focuses on simple, honest ingredients. The dough is enriched with extra virgin olive oil—super tasty—and rolled out thin to perfectly enclose the filling. Plus, melted butter adds a golden gloss and depth of flavor. It is a staple on family tables, crafted by hand and passed down through time, showing off Piedmont's pride in its rich food traditions.

Some families, I gotta say, add their own twists—like a hint of nutmeg or a unique local cheese—but the core remains: honest ingredients and careful preparation. Really really timeless. It’s the kind of homemade ravioli with rice and cheese that brings back memories of long Sunday lunches and stories at the table. As a vegetarian option, it’s ideal for family meals, offering a taste of Italian comfort food. When you savor the delicate balance of flavors, you understand why this recipe endures.

To prepare ris and cabbage ravioli, start by pouring the flour onto the work surface, make a well, then pour the eggs in the center and start mixing. Continue by adding the oil and keep working with your hands. You will need to form a smooth and elastic dough. Once ready, make a ball, cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes. Finely chop celery, carrot, and onion (even better if you use a food processor), sauté for a few minutes in a pan with a drizzle of oil, stirring occasionally. Also finely chop the cabbage and add it to the pan. Stir occasionally and cook for 10 minutes. Add about 6.8 ounces of milk from the total amount, stir and then cover with the lid, cook for about 1 hour. In a large pot pour water, salt to taste, also add 17 ounces of milk and bring to a boil. Cook the rice for 18-20 minutes from when it returns to a boil (check cooking, then drain and let cool).
Once the pasta has rested, you can divide it into 2 parts, passing one piece at a time through the pasta machine to create a very thin strip of dough. Combine the cold rice and the cooked and cooled cabbage with the filling and make small piles about 1.5 inches apart from each other. Brush the dough where there is no filling with water, so that the dough you will place on top sticks more easily, always very thin. Gently press with your fingers where there is no filling before passing the fluted pasta cutter to get your rather large square-shaped ravioli.
You can cook them for about 90 seconds in salted boiling water to taste, then sauté them in a pan with melted butter, cooked until it becomes nutty! Enjoy your meal!
The ravioli can be frozen, spaced out on a tray, and once they harden, they can be transferred to a bag.
They should be cooked frozen, for 3-4 minutes in boiling water.

The scraps can be kneaded again or can be cooked as maltagliati!
Corn oil can be used instead of olive oil for the dough.
