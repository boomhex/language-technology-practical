instructions:
To make asparagus and prawn risotto, first prepare the vegetable broth following our recipe and keep it warm. Clean the asparagus and boil them in a pot starting with cold water for about ten minutes from when the water reaches a boil . Meanwhile, clean the prawns by removing the head and shell , then cut along the back and gently remove the intestine .
When the asparagus are cooked, coarsely chop the stems and set aside the tips . Transfer the stems to a mixer with some of the cooking water and blend to obtain a smooth cream .
Now clean and thinly slice the onion , then sauté it in a pan with the oil for a few minutes . When the onion is softened, add the asparagus cream .
Add the rice and stir everything for a couple of minutes , then start pouring in one ladle of broth at a time . Cook the rice, adding broth as needed.
Meanwhile, heat the oil in another pan , add the prawns and asparagus tips and sauté for 2 minutes on high heat . Salt and pepper to taste.
When the rice is cooked, transfer the prawns and asparagus tips to the pan and mix everything together. Turn off the heat and blend with the creamy cheese , mix well and serve your asparagus and prawn risotto !
It is recommended to consume the asparagus and prawn risotto immediately. You can store it in the refrigerator for one day, in an airtight container.
If you wish, you can replace the fresh spreadable cheese with butter or a splash of fresh cream to give creaminess to the asparagus and prawn risotto.
