Baci di dama con farina di mais are these biscotti tradizionali italiani that feel kinda special but also really down-to-earth. They're from Piedmont , up in northern Italy, where they've been made forever. And the cool thing about this version? They use corn flour instead of the usual wheat. So, you get this more rustic, crumbly texture that's really really unique. The name means "lady’s kisses"—and it fits. You’ve got two little cookies with a bit of melted chocolate in the middle, like they’re stuck together in a sweet hug. Seriously good. You bite into one, and it’s just tender enough to break with a gentle snap, then the chocolate kinda melts on your tongue.
For anyone into regional treats, these are a fun twist on a classic, nodding to the area’s farming roots where corn was easy to find.
On special occasions like birthdays or even a chill coffee with friends, baci di dama con farina di mais just shine. They’re not huge or messy, and the ricetta baci di dama is pretty simple. You don’t need to be some baking pro to whip up a batch that looks and tastes great. The color's a little more golden thanks to the corn flour. And you can really taste that slight, almost sweet flavor in every bite.
People often compare these to usual Italian butter cookies, but there's something extra. Really, it's the grainy, almost sandy feel that sticks with you. If you want to serve something that feels fancy but is actually pretty easy, these biscotti con farina di mais are the way to go. Folks in Piedmont have known this forever, and now the word's spreading in Italy, especially among those who like crunchy yet soft cookies with that real homemade vibe.
Even if you’re just hunting for a new ricetta biscotti al cioccolato , this one’s worth a shot. To be honest, if you like a rustic edge to your sweets, you'll love it.
To prepare the lady's kisses with cornmeal, sift together the cornmeal and all-purpose flour in a large bowl , then add sugar and the seeds from a vanilla bean or, if you don't have it, vanilla extract or vanillin .
Well mix all the ingredients with a whisk , then separate the egg whites from the yolks and melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add the melted butter to the flours and finally the yolks .
and start kneading . When the mixture starts to become compact, transfer it to a floured board and continue working it with your hands . Form a ball , cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rest for at least half an hour in the refrigerator.
After the necessary time has passed, line a baking sheet with a sheet of parchment paper and start forming small balls, slightly flattened on one side, with the dough , then place them on the baking sheet (let them rest again in the refrigerator if the dough is too soft) and bake them at 356°F for 20 minutes . Once baked, let them cool on a rack
and prepare the filling by melting the dark chocolate in a bain-marie . When the cookies are cold, place a few drops of melted chocolate on the flat side of a cookie and close with a second cookie. When the chocolate solidifies, the cookies will stick together, forming a fragrant ball with a chocolate filling .
You can store the lady's kisses with cornmeal in a tin box for up to 4-5 days.
If you wish, you can replace the dark chocolate with milk or white chocolate.
