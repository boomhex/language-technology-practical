instructions:
To prepare paccheri cheese, pepper, and sausage, peel and chop the onion . Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan and sauté the onion . Take the sausage and remove the casing .

Cut the sausage into small pieces and add it to the pan . When it is well browned, after about 10 minutes, deglaze with red wine and let it evaporate.
Boil the paccheri in plenty of salted boiling water , they should be drained al dente. The cooking time is about 16 minutes, but check the instructions on the package. Finely grate the cheeses into a bowl , add a small amount of cooking water .

Grate a generous amount of black pepper , mix with a spatula until you get a compact consistency, not too crumbly but not uniform and creamy either. Drain the paccheri into the pan with the sausage and onion , add the cheese mixture .
Don’t worry, just stir and toss the paccheri in the pan with a little cooking water at a time until it all melts and becomes a cheese and pepper cream . Be careful not to pour too much water which would curdle the mixture. Serve the cheese and pepper paccheri with sausage piping hot .
We recommend consuming the cheese and pepper paccheri with sausage immediately.
Use less pasta cooking water so the water is rich in starch and will facilitate the formation of the typical creamy sauce.
