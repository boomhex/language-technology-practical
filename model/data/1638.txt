instructions:
To prepare the beer-battered fried calamari, first, clean the calamari. Lay them on a cutting board and detach the head from the mantle with your hands . Then remove the transparent cartilage quill from the latter and rinse it well under running water . Transfer them back to a cutting board and gently remove the skin with a small knife .
Then also remove the fins and cut the calamari into rings . Take the tentacles, remove the eye area and the central beak by pushing it out.
Set the calamari aside and prepare the accompanying sauce. Pour the Greek yogurt into a bowl , add the chopped chives , the lime zest
and 15 g (about 1 tbsp) of lime juice . Add a tablespoon of oil , salt, pepper, and mix well .
Heat the oil and in the meantime prepare the batter by pouring the flour into a bowl , add a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of oil .
Add the beer and stir until you get a smooth batter . Then pour the well-drained calamari inside and mix everything to ensure the batter adheres perfectly.
When the oil is hot, fry the calamari. You can use tongs to transfer them to the pan to remove excess batter. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the batter is golden. Then drain them and transfer them to a tray lined with kitchen paper . Salt and serve your beer-battered fried calamari with the Greek yogurt sauce.
Enjoy the beer-battered fried calamari immediately to savor all their crispiness!
Double the batter quantities and use it to prepare a mix of vegetables!
