instructions:
To prepare the bean purée, first soak the dried cannellini beans in cold water for about 12 hours , covering the bowl with food wrap. After the time has passed, drain the beans and rinse them under running water . In a pot, add the beans, cover them with cold water , and cook over medium heat for about 2 hours.
During cooking, we recommend skimming , if necessary. Using a ladle, transfer the cooked beans to a colander , discarding the cooking water but keeping some aside .
In a saucepan, add 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, peeled garlic , and lightly brown. Add the beans , stirring with a wooden spoon ;
season with salt and pepper and cook for about 7 minutes to let the flavors meld. Remove the garlic clove . And transfer the cooked beans to the blender .
Add a ladle of the reserved cooking water and blend until a soft and lump-free purée is obtained . Transfer the cannellini bean purée to a plate .
On a cutting board, cut the slices of speck into strips . In a pan, add the speck and brown over high heat without any seasoning until it becomes crispy .
Season the bean purée with a drizzle of olive oil , distribute the crispy speck , decorate with dill leaves, and serve immediately .
The bean purée can be stored in the fridge, covered with wrap, for about 3 days. It can be frozen without seasoning, thawed as needed, and seasoned with oil, speck, and dill. The beans can be cooked the day before, and the purée prepared later.
As an alternative to speck, you can flavor the purée with stracchino or other fresh cheese, obtaining a tasty vegetarian version!
