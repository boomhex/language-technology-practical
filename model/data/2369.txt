Casarecce pasta with cod sauce, zucchini, and black olives really captures the sunny vibe of southern Italy. This casarecce pasta recipe comes from those stunning regions of Sicily and Calabria, where the land meets the sea. People there love mixing fresh veggies with local fish. And listen, the way the tender cod adds richness without overpowering? So so good. Zucchini brings a moist, almost sweet touch that soaks up all the juices, while black olives give a salty, Mediterranean kick. You end up with a plate that’s golden and colorful. Seriously good. The sauce stays light, so every bite is fresh.
It’s the kind of food that feels like summer—no matter the season—because it’s packed with real, simple flavors that don’t need much fussing around. If you love a cod sauce pasta full of flavor but not heavy, this one really hits the spot. Thing is, the sauce gently covers each twisty piece of casarecce—making it stand out among other Mediterranean pasta dish options.
A hint of crispy zucchini on the edges and the tangy pop from cherry tomatoes—along with those briny black olives—keep things interesting. Pretty much. Southern Italian kitchens often use what’s at hand. And you know what? These ingredients work together in a relaxed, easygoing way that’s hard not to love.
