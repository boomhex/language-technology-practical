To prepare reginette with white asparagus pesto, start by thoroughly washing the asparagus under running water . Then peel the stalk with a vegetable peeler to remove the outermost and fibrous part ; then cut off the ends of the stalks, the hardest part, to even them out . For these steps, you can also refer to the cooking school guide: how to clean asparagus.
Now, tie the asparagus with kitchen twine . In an asparagus cooker or a tall, narrow pot, pour water until it's 3/4 full, salt it, and add the asparagus to blanch them. Place them upright, leaving the tips just above the water (they will cook with the steam) . Cook for about 20 minutes.
Once the time is up, drain them and let them cool in a bowl . Then transfer the asparagus to a cutting board and cut them into chunks, keeping the tips aside .
Now that you have the asparagus parts ready , place the chopped stalks in a mixer and add the grated and mixed Pecorino and Parmesan .
Add the pine nuts, pepper, and salt . Then blend everything to obtain a smooth cream, then stop the mixer and add the oil ; let the blades run for a few more minutes to create a thick and smooth cream. Transfer the obtained cream to a large pan and set aside for the final creaming. Meanwhile, in a large pot, add water, salt to taste, and bring to a boil. Then pour in the reginette .
Cook them for the time indicated on the package and drain them while still al dente into the pan where you previously poured the asparagus pesto , turn on the heat to medium and toss the pasta for a few seconds .
Adjust with pepper to taste , add the asparagus tips you set aside , and serve your delicious reginette with white asparagus pesto hot !
