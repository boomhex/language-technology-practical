To prepare maccheroni alla chitarra, start by sifting the flour onto a work surface; then create the classic well shape and crack the eggs into the center. Beat them with a fork gradually gathering the flour ; then continue kneading by hand for at least 10-15 minutes, until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough. Form a dough ball, flatten it slightly and wrap it in plastic wrap . You can let the fresh pasta rest outside the fridge, in a cool, dry place for at least 1 hour.
Take the chitarra (the traditional wooden tool used for shaping the pasta) , then roll out part of the dough with a rolling pin (you can wrap the remaining dough in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out) into a sheet not too thin (about 0.2 inches) preferably giving it a rectangular shape to lay it more easily on the chitarra: you can roll the sheet onto the rolling pin and unroll it on the chitarra so that it adheres well to the strings of the tool .
Use a small rolling pin specifically used for this pasta format or a common rolling pin over the entire length of the sheet, applying firm pressure so the sheet is cut in a single pass . Proceed in the same way for all the pasta sheets, and as you form the maccheroni alla chitarra , place them on a pasta drying rack or spread them out well on a floured surface to dry a bit. Your maccheroni alla chitarra are ready to be cooked, dressed and served!
The maccheroni alla chitarra can be stored in the refrigerator covered with a lightly floured clean cloth for a maximum of 1-2 days. They can be frozen after letting the pasta rest for 2-3 hours. Arrange them spaced on a lightly floured tray and once frozen, transfer them to a freezer bag.
If you want to prepare maccheroni alla chitarra with mutton sauce, just add 9 oz of lamb meat to a sauté of garlic and onion, brown it, then add half a glass of white wine, let it evaporate, and add the tomato puree and two bay leaves. Let it cook for about 45 minutes, then add different colored peppers cut into strips and previously sautéed in a pan with some oil. If you cannot make maccheroni alla chitarra at home, there are ready-made pasta packages available; you just need to prepare the accompanying sauce to enjoy this typical Abruzzese recipe.
In ancient times, saffron was added to the dough prepared for the maccheroni alla chitarra sheets, dissolved beforehand in the eggs. The goodness of maccheroni alla chitarra depends on their compactness, partly due to the eggs contained within, and the long manual processing on the work surface that makes them very resistant to cooking.
