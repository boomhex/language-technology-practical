Caffè shakerato al limone? Oh, it's a drink that just flips the script on what you expect from iced coffee. Seriously. Instead of just cold coffee and ice, you get a super zesty twist from a bold lemon syrup made by simmering water, sugar, and thin strips of lemon peel. And listen, the real magic happens when everything is shaken up over ice—suddenly, the bitter punch of caffè espresso turns refreshing and light with the help of that sweet, sciroppo al limone . In Italy, folks especially love this on hot days, and you’ll find the caffè shakerato al limone as a go-to bevanda estiva al caffè . The flavor combo is wild but works way way better than you’d expect—the tangy lemon cuts through the rich coffee, leaving you with a drink that’s crisp and totally different from your average iced coffee. Which is great.
And look, many people like to elevate their ricetta caffè shakerato al limone by serving it with candied lemon peels dipped in chocolate. Really good stuff. This adds a bit of sweet bite and makes the whole thing feel fancy without being too much. The cool foam you get on top after shaking makes this drink feel special, and you don’t need to be a coffee expert to appreciate how the moist texture just glides down. Here's the deal: there are regional tweaks too—down south, some folks go heavier on the lemon for an extra tart pop, while up north they might sweeten things a bit more. No question, this caffè freddo al limone surprises with how bright and crisp it tastes, especially when you want something that wakes you up but still cools you off. For sure. For anyone looking for a new spin on their usual caffè freddo , this is a drink that totally shakes things up—in every sense of the word. Whether you're enjoying it in a bustling café in Rome or making it at home, this drink is sure to become a favorite, bringing a taste of Italian summer right to your glass.
Prepare the lemon-flavored syrup the day before the shaken coffee. Take a lemon, preferably untreated or Sorrento lemon, which is sweeter, and remove the peel with a vegetable peeler and cut the zest into julienne strips . Then take a saucepan and pour in the sugar .
Add the water , the sliced zests and bring to a boil for at least 9 minutes . Then transfer it to a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. The syrup should rest in the refrigerator overnight before it can be used. The indicated doses will yield a quantity of syrup greater than that needed for the preparation of the shaken coffee. The leftover syrup can be stored in the fridge for 1 month with the zests completely submerged and tightly closed in a glass jar.
To prepare the candied lemon peels, take a lemon, remove the pulp while keeping the white part and the peel, then cut into strips about 0.39 inches thick . Take a saucepan, fill it with water, and add the lemon peels , blanch them 3 times, changing the water each time .
Now pour the sugar into another saucepan and add the water . Add the blanched lemon peels and simmer for about 60 minutes over very low heat in the water and sugar syrup.
Once candied, transfer them with a strainer from the saucepan to a rack to drain . Meanwhile, melt the dark chocolate, tempering it in the microwave not exceeding 88°F, and when the peels are dry, dip them 3/4 into the chocolate and place them on a sheet of parchment paper to let the chocolate solidify .
To prepare the shaken coffee with lemon, start with the coffee. To get a great coffee, fill your moka pot's boiler with cold water, ideally low in calcium, making sure not to exceed the safety valve (otherwise you'll get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee creating a mound that you'll level by tapping the filter on the table with decisive movements . Do not press with the spoon, nor make holes in the surface .
Close the coffee maker very tightly , so that the coffee does not leak from the sides as it rises, and place it on a low and consistent flame to get a full-bodied coffee. As the coffee rises, a thick foam will form : we recommend not letting the coffee gurgle too long to maintain its sweetness and aroma. Your coffee is ready: before using it, stir it directly in the moka with a spoon to make the coffee more homogeneous .
Now take the lemon zest syrup you left to rest in the fridge overnight and strain 80 ml (the amount needed for 4 shaken coffees) through a sieve, separating it from the zests . At this point, take a shaker and to prepare 1 shaken coffee, add 5/6 ice cubes, then add 20 ml of lemon syrup and 50 ml of freshly brewed moka coffee, still hot .
Now shake well and vigorously . Pour the coffee into a martini glass : if you have shaken well, you will get about 0.39 inches of foam. Once garnished with the zests , your shaken coffee with lemon is ready to be served and enjoyed along with the candied lemon peels!
The shaken coffee with lemon is a drink to be consumed immediately. The leftover zest syrup can be stored in the fridge for 1 month with the zests completely submerged and tightly closed in a glass jar.
