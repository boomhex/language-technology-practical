Sfoglie con crema obatzda e paprika is your ticket to bringing a real taste of Bavaria right to your table. These puff pastry appetizers really, really show off the classic flavors of southern Germany—with a little twist. The star here is the Bavarian cheese spread , Obatzda. It's usually made with Camembert, butter, and just enough beer to make it creamy and give it that little tangy kick. But here's the thing, this version sneaks in some stracchino cheese—something you won't always find in Munich. Stracchino adds a mild touch, making it even more smooth and perfect for anyone who loves cheese spreads but wants it a bit softer. And you know what? With a sprinkle of sweet paprika, you not only get that beautiful color but also a gentle smoky hint that just complements the cheesy filling so, so well.
Pair these Obatzda recipe puffs with a light German beer, and you're set. In Bavaria, this kind of homemade cheese spread is a beer garden staple or an easy snack at gatherings. Which is great. They’re crispy outside, soft and savory inside, and they just vanish when you serve them. The puff pastry squares hold the paprika cheese spread perfectly, so no mess. Perfect for gatherings where people just snack, chat, and sip on something cold.
