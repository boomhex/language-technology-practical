instructions:
To prepare the pasta with cauliflower, first clean the cauliflower: remove the central stalk and leaves , then separate the florets from the stems and set them aside. Coarsely chop the stems with a knife .
In a pan, flavor some olive oil with the garlic cloves in their skins and the chili pepper , then add the chopped stems . Sauté for a minute, then add the florets .
Salt and cook over high heat for 7-8 minutes (46-47 degrees Fahrenheit) . Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and add the pasta .
At this point, remove the garlic and deglaze the cauliflower with a ladle of the pasta cooking water , then lower the heat. Drain the pasta very al dente directly into the pan and finish cooking by adding more cooking water .
Once ready, toss with a drizzle of olive oil and mix well . Plate and serve your pasta with cauliflower immediately, adding a pinch of chili pepper if desired !
Pasta with cauliflower can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container.
If you want to freeze it, we recommend gratinating it later in the oven.
If you need to reduce preparation time, you can boil the cauliflower florets with the pasta during the last 4 minutes of cooking, then drain everything into the pan where you have sautéed the garlic with the chili pepper and continue with the risotto-style cooking.
Don't throw away the leaves and central stem of the cauliflower… you can use them to make a creamy soup!
Did you know that in Sicily, cauliflowers are commonly called broccoli? The typical recipe of pasta with Arriminati broccoli, in fact, is not really a Pasta with broccoli but rather a regional variant of pasta with cauliflower enriched with anchovies, pine nuts, raisins, saffron, and breadcrumbs!
