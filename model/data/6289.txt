instructions:
To prepare pumpkin cream , start by preparing the vegetable stock. Now clean the pumpkin. Cut it into slices , remove the peel and the seeds inside; now you need 1.32 lb (600 g) of pulp, diced . Peel the potatoes
and dice them too . Peel and finely chop the onion , then place it in a pan with the oil; leave to brown on a low flame .
Once the onion changes color, add the pumpkin and the potatoes too. Add part of the vegetable stock to cover all the vegetables ; you'll add the remaining part later.
Add salt and pepper to taste . Leave to cook on a low flame for 25/30 minutes and add a little vegetable stock at a time. Once the vegetables finish cooking, remove from the heat and blend with an immersion mixer ,
to obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream. Now add the cinnamon , the nutmeg , and stir. Your pumpkin cream is ready now! Serve with some delicious croutons by cutting the bread into cubes that aren't too small
and placing them on a tray lined with parchment paper. Drizzle with oil and bake for around 5 minutes in a preheated oven set to grill, then remove . Serve the pumpkin cream in a soup bowl, with a sprinkling of croutons .
Store pumpkin cream in the refrigerator for 2 days at most. Or, you can freeze it too!
Turn this pumpkin cream into a delicate first course by adding some previously cooked rice or barley!
