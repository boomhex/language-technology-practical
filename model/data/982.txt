Cistecca is one of those foods that just screams Campania —really. It's like those crisp, golden afternoons near Naples. This street food from Monte di Procida is packed with so much flavor and has that laid-back vibe. What really really makes a cistecca sandwich special? It's the simplicity of its ingredients —you've got fresh bread with a crunchy exterior, juicy sliced beef, and melted cheese that gets all gooey and soft. People around the peninsula flegrea, you know, often add their own twist. So you might find rich salads or grilled veggies tucked in there. In the homemade versions, eggplant slices add a deeper, almost tender bite—seriously good. This isn’t just a meal; it’s a taste of neighborhood life. Something to grab while hanging with friends or just watching the world go by.
People who've spent time in Campania chat about the cistecca recipe like it's this little secret handshake—everyone has their own take. But every bite gives you that moist and savory feeling. The kind you only get from real, home-cooked food. Here's the thing, what’s cool about this cistecca steak sandwich is how it blends the spirit of a traditional Italian sandwich with that street food energy—keeps it exciting. Some versions, to be honest, lean heavy on the cheese. Others keep it simple with just steak and bread. All have a special Campanian kick, though. Eggplants, especially in the Monte di Procida style, highlight those classic regional flavors and add a heartier feel. And look, you’ll often find people debating the best cistecca preparation or sharing tips on keeping the bread crispy while ensuring the meat stays juicy. Whether you're enjoying it at a bustling market or a quiet street corner, it's about sharing good food, local stories, and a little taste of southern Italy right in your hands.

To prepare the cistecca montese, start with the eggplants, clean them, and cut them into cubes. Then move on to the meat, which needs to be cut into very small cubes . Thinly slice the smoked scamorza cheese and grate the provolone cheese .
Move to the stove. In a pan, fry the halved garlic in a drizzle of oil . Add the eggplants and sauté, stirring occasionally. When they are softened, remove the garlic and season with salt and pepper to taste, then set aside; you'll need the pan later.
Pour a splash of oil into another pan and add the meat , sauté it for a few minutes over high heat until well browned but tender inside. Then add salt and pepper and the previously sautéed eggplants, allowing everything to gain flavor .
Meanwhile, halve the baguettes lengthwise and briefly toast them in the pan used to cook the eggplants, making sure that the crumb is in contact with the pan . When the crumb is slightly browned, remove the bread .
Place a few lettuce leaves on the base of each sandwich . At this point, gather the meat into 2 piles roughly the size of the sandwiches , lower the heat a little, and add the smoked scamorza cheese on top .
In just a few moments it will be melted, so turn off the heat and lift the filling with a spatula , placing it directly on the baguette base . Add the grated caciocavallo cheese on top .
Then close with the other half , and here is the first sandwich ready . Prepare the second one, and your cistecca montese is finally ready .
It is recommended to consume the cistecca montese immediately.
The addition of eggplants is to give a summer touch and extra flavor to the cistecca montese; feel free to use other sides as well. For example, in Naples, friarielli, eggplant parmigiana, fresh tomatoes with arugula are used.
Up until some time ago, the cistecca montese had a somewhat different appearance. It was born at the beginning of the 1900s from the idea of two brothers, Pat and Harry Olivieri, who made their fortune in America thanks to their hot dog stand. One day, the Italian-American brothers, having run out of hot dogs, decided to use freshly sliced meat directly on the griddle, mixing it with cheese. The combination of cheese + steak, hence the cistecca! Only in the 80s, when the migratory flow reversed, did it bring the best from the States to Italy. The Montese, inhabitants of Monte di Procida, introduced the cistecca from kiosks to restaurants, quickly becoming the typical dish and true pride of local and Campanian cuisine. In 2014, a group of Phlegraean entrepreneurs decided to join forces in the form of a Consortium to protect the product and provide a production guideline.
