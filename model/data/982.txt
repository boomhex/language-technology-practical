instructions:
To prepare temaki, you will need to have Sushi rice: how to cook it and which one to choose kept warm in a suitable Ohitsu or a wooden or steel container; you should use it at a temperature of about 97°F. Also, prepare a small bowl with water and a little rice vinegar. With a sharp knife, cut a rectangle from a tuna fillet that is 3.5 inches long and about 0.6 inches thick . Take the half sheet of nori seaweed and position it in your left hand with the smoother, shinier side contacting the palm. The hand it rests on should be completely dry . Dip your right hand in the acidulated water and quickly dab it on a small towel .
With your right hand, take about 1.8 oz of sushi rice and place it on the left side of the seaweed , gently pressing with your fingers to form a triangle .
Add a hint of fresh wasabi to the center of the rice , place the shiso leaf , and then the small rectangle of fresh tuna, placed on the shiso leaf, at the top left corner of the seaweed sheet , so that once rolled, part of it sticks out.
Start rolling the seaweed sheet from the bottom left corner , from the part in contact with your palm under your thumb. Roll almost to the end, and to seal the final part of the cone, you can use a few grains of rice from the filling . Your temaki is ready !
It is recommended to consume the temaki shortly after preparation, like all types of sushi that should be made and consumed immediately.
The rice can be prepared in advance and kept warm to be used at a temperature of about 97°F. It can also be heated in the microwave as needed.
Temaki can be enjoyed with soy sauce poured directly on the tuna part.
You can enrich your temaki by preparing it with avocado, salmon, or even tempura shrimp!
Before consuming raw, marinated, or not perfectly cooked fish, it is recommended to freeze it for at least 96 hours at -0.4°F in a domestic freezer marked with 3 or more stars, according to guidelines from the Ministry of Health .
