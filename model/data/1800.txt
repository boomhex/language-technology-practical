instructions:
To prepare the beer potatoes, rinse the potatoes under running water to remove any soil residues , dry them well, and without peeling, cut them first into quarters and then into cubes of about 1 inch .
Take a square of foil, place a square of parchment paper on top and place about 7 oz of potato cubes in the center . Season the potatoes with salt , pepper
and a few rosemary needles , then add about 1 tbsp of butter . Finally, lift the edges of the packet and pour in about 2 tbsp of red beer .
Close the foil well and repeat the same procedure for the other 3 packets, which you will place in a baking dish or on a baking tray . Bake in a preheated fan oven at 430°F for about 35 minutes, then remove from the oven and serve your beer potatoes hot !
Beer potatoes can be stored for one day in the refrigerator, in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
If you want to create even richer and tastier packets, try adding smoked scamorza cheese, some bacon cubes, and maybe even a couple of sage leaves inside! If you prefer to use a light beer, keep in mind that it will give the potatoes a much more delicate aroma; on the contrary, dark beer might be too bitter.
