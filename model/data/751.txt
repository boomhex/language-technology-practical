instructions:
To make the baskets with coffee cream, first chop the chocolate with a knife . Melt the chocolate in the microwave, at 300 W for 30 seconds, intermittently. It can also be melted in a double boiler on the stove. In a bowl, pour the soy crispies and add the melted dark chocolate . Mix with a spatula to combine the two ingredients .
Pour the mixture into a muffin mold that is 2.4 inches in diameter and 1.6 inches high. Using the back of a teaspoon, shape it into a basket by making a hole in the center and spreading the mixture on the walls of the cupcake liner . This way, you'll have created the baskets . Place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or until the chocolate hardens. Prepare the coffee cream: whip the cream with an electric mixer .
Add the powdered sugar and continue whipping. Add the cold unsweetened coffee and gently mix to avoid deflating the mixture .
Pour the cream into a pastry bag with a smooth nozzle of 0.6 inches in diameter . Remove the baskets from the cupcake liners and place them on the serving tray. Fill the baskets with the coffee cream and decorate with dark chocolate shavings . The baskets with coffee cream can be enjoyed immediately or stored in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
The baskets with coffee cream can be stored in the refrigerator for one day if already filled with coffee cream. The shells without filling can be stored for 3 days in a food bag in the refrigerator. Freezing is not recommended.
As an alternative to crispy soy, you can use puffed rice.
