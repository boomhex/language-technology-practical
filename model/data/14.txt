instructions:
To prepare the gingerbread house cake, start with the cookie dough: in a bowl, place the all-purpose flour together with the baking soda and brown sugar , then add a pinch of salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon .
Also flavor with ginger and cocoa , then mix to combine the dry ingredients . Now add the cold cubed butter .
Incorporate the butter quickly with your fingertips to obtain a sandy mixture , then pour in the beaten egg and honey .
Knead with your hands first in the bowl and then on the work surface . Form a dough ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest in the refrigerator for 3 hours .
After the resting time, gently tap the dough with a rolling pin to make it pliable again , then lightly flour it and roll it out to a thickness of about 1/8 inch . Cut out 3 Christmas tree-shaped cookies using cookie cutters of various sizes .
Also cut out 8-9 houses using different templates . Place the cookie shapes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 10 minutes, on the center rack . Once baked, remove from the oven and let cool .
To prepare the cake batter, start with the buttermilk: in a bowl, pour the yogurt, milk , and lemon juice , then mix with a whisk and let it rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes.
After this time, add the vegetable oil , egg white , and vinegar .
Mix with a whisk to combine the liquids and set aside for a moment. In another bowl, combine the sugar and almond flour , then sift in the all-purpose flour .
Sift the cocoa , cinnamon , and ginger into the bowl as well.
Finally, add the baking soda and a pinch of salt. Mix with a whisk to combine the dry ingredients . At this point, pour the liquid ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients .
Mix well with the whisk until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous batter . Divide the batter evenly between two 8-inch springform pans, which you have previously greased with butter and lined with parchment paper at the base . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 33-35 minutes, on the first lower rack. Check the baking with a toothpick, then remove from the oven and let cool completely before removing the cakes from the pans .
To assemble the cake, first prepare the frosting: in a bowl, combine the mascarpone, cream cheese , powdered sugar , and cream .
Mix well with electric beaters to obtain a firm and homogeneous cream , then transfer it to a piping bag without a nozzle. Once the bases have completely cooled, remove the top dome with a serrated knife to level the surface . Take the serving plate and squeeze a dollop of cream at the base to keep the cake steady .
Place the first base on the plate and fill it with a generous layer of frosting , then level with a spatula .
Lay the second base on top and add the remaining cream, both on the edges and on the surface, then smooth it well to make it even and uniform . Place the cake in the refrigerator to set for at least 3 hours .
To decorate the cookies, first prepare the royal icing: in a bowl, pour the egg white, powdered sugar , and lemon juice , then beat with electric beaters for about 5 minutes until you obtain a firm and homogeneous mixture .
Transfer the royal icing to a parchment paper cone and decorate the cookies as desired . Let the decorated cookies dry at room temperature for at least an hour .
Take the cake out of the refrigerator and place the house-shaped cookies along the edges , then arrange the tree-shaped cookies vertically on the surface . Your gingerbread house cake is ready to be served !
The gingerbread house cake can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days.
Gingerbread cookies can be prepared in advance and stored in a tin box for 3-4 days. The raw dough can be stored in the refrigerator for 4 days or frozen for about a month.
The cake bases can be prepared the day before and stored at room temperature, well wrapped in plastic wrap.
It is recommended to prepare the frosting and royal icing at the moment.
It's important to work the gingerbread cookie dough very quickly and respect the resting time in the refrigerator to handle it easily.
For the frosting, you can substitute the mascarpone with the same amount of cream cheese.
