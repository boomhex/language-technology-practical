instructions:
To prepare the swordfish meatballs, first remove the skin and central bone from the swordfish and cut it first into strips and then into cubes about 1 cm (0.39 inches) . Transfer everything into a bowl and set aside. Soak the sandwich bread in milk .
Squeeze it well and add it to the swordfish, breaking it into pieces with your hands . Also add the crushed garlic .
Add the chopped parsley , season with salt and pepper , and also add the grated lemon zest .
Put the egg and breadcrumbs in the bowl, then mix until you get a compact but workable mixture. If necessary, add more breadcrumbs.
Form 12 meatballs of the same size and slightly oval , then roll them first in the egg and then in the breadcrumbs , making sure the breadcrumbs adhere well to the entire surface of the meatballs.
Fry in peanut oil at 356°F . Fry 3-4 meatballs at a time so as not to lower the oil temperature too much. Then place them on absorbent paper to remove excess oil. The swordfish meatballs are ready to be served, perhaps accompanied by mayonnaise .
Swordfish meatballs should be eaten as soon as they are ready, but if you have leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for 1-2 days.
If you like a stronger flavor, you can enrich them with chopped capers and olives. If you prefer to bake the swordfish meatballs, place them on a baking sheet, spray with a little extra virgin olive oil, and bake in a fan oven at 356°F for 20-25 minutes.
