instructions:
To prepare the cuttlefish in air fryer, start with the breading: in a food processor, combine the breadcrumbs , drained sun-dried tomatoes , and salt .
Add a grind of black pepper , lemon juice , and parsley .
Finally, pour in the extra virgin olive oil , then close the food processor and blend everything . Transfer the obtained breading to a baking dish .
Coat the already cleaned cuttlefish with the breading, making sure it adheres well also on the tentacles . Place the cuttlefish in the air fryer (we used a fryer with a capacity of about 1.5 gallons) and cook at 320°F for 10 minutes . Once ready, serve your cuttlefish in air fryer immediately, maybe accompanied by a fresh salad !
The cuttlefish in air fryer can be stored in the refrigerator for one day, in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
Cooking time may vary depending on the size of the cuttlefish.
We chose to use breadcrumbs to obtain a soft coating that adheres better to the cuttlefish. For a crunchier coating, you can replace it with rustic breadcrumbs.
