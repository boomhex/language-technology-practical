Stelline alla Nutella are such a fun treat, popping up during Italian holidays like Carnevale or New Year. You know, these little bites are all about fun and keeping things, well, pretty simple. Basically, at their heart, you've got this Nutella star bread —just some sliced bread or maybe a bit of sweet brioche, cut into playful shapes like stars, hearts, or even flowers. The best part? It’s how tender the bread gets after a quick dip in milk and egg. Seriously good. Then you stuff it with creamy, chocolatey Nutella, making every bite a mix of sweet and moist goodness. And look, whether you dust them with powdered sugar or toss on some colorful sprinkles, you end up with a Nutella dessert recipe that's kinda like a holiday party on a plate. It's not just tasty—it’s really, really about the spirit of Italian home baking, where quick treats become special with just a bit of creativity and, honestly, a lot of fun.
And here's the thing: these treats are super flexible. You can switch things up based on what you like or what’s handy. In different parts of Italy, folks might use jam instead of Nutella or go for a different bread for a softer or more crispy bite. The shapes? Pretty much anything you want. Let the kids cut them out for extra laughs. No need to wait for some fancy event; these are perfect for last-minute snacks or when you want to bring that festive Italian vibe into your kitchen. You'll see why Nutella pastry is such a hit for holiday baking. It comes together fast but feels like something special.

To prepare Nutella stars, start by cutting the sandwich bread with a star-shaped cookie cutter ; you can naturally use the shape you prefer (heart, flower, circle). Take the Nutella, which you have put in the refrigerator for half an hour to firm up a bit (alternatively, put it in the freezer for 10-15 minutes), and place a teaspoon on the sandwich bread shape , then cover with another shape by pressing lightly on the edges. Continue like this for all the others.
Take a bowl and beat the egg with the milk (4-5). Then dip the stars in the egg and milk mixture .
Melt the butter in a non-stick pan , place the shapes in it , and cook them on both sides until they are nicely golden. Then place them on a sheet covered with absorbent paper, dust them with powdered sugar, and cover with some colorful sprinkles... serve them hot!
If you prefer, instead of Nutella, you can use jam, as long as it has a thick and rather compact consistency!
