instructions:
To prepare the ricotta and blueberry jam pound cake, first crack the eggs into a bowl, add the sugar , and beat everything with an electric mixer until the mixture is well whipped. Then, while continuing to beat, add the oil gradually .
Add the well-drained ricotta and a pinch of salt . Continue to beat with the electric mixer and when it's well incorporated, add the all-purpose flour .
and the baking powder . On low speed, incorporate them with the mixer until you get a smooth batter .
Grease and flour a 12x4 inch loaf pan , then pour the batter inside and level the surface with a spatula .
Add the jam with a spoon and use a wooden skewer to create circular movements to achieve a marbled effect. Bake the pound cake at 350°F for 40 minutes in a preheated static oven. Then remove from the oven and let it cool before removing from the pan and slicing your pound cake.
The ricotta pound cake can be stored under a glass dome for 2-3 days. Alternatively, you can freeze it once baked, perhaps already portioned.
You can replace the blueberry jam with cherry or mixed berry jam.
