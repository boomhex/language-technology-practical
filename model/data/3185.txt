instructions:
To prepare the frangipane cream, start by creaming the room-temperature butter with the sugar using electric beaters. When the mixture is well creamed, add the two eggs one at a time , continuing to beat with the electric beaters . Finally, add the almond flour, mixing well with a wooden spoon to blend it into the butter, sugar, and egg mixture .
At this point, bring the mixture to the stove and cook the cream until it thickens (the consistency should be very similar to custard, although slightly lumpier); when the cream starts to boil, you can turn off the heat. If you use the frangipane cream to fill a pie or tartlets, you can place it raw on the shortcrust pastry (also raw) and bake it directly in the oven !
Frangipane cream is decidedly rich, so we recommend using it for cakes that include a lot of fruit, such as apples, pears, raspberries, blueberries, etc.
