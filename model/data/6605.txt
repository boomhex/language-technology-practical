The slow cooking then ensures an incredibly tender and succulent texture, completed by a thick and enveloping sauce created by blending the cooking juices. This way, the slices of meat will melt in your mouth, offering a harmony of flavors.

Braised beef with Barolo can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container, preferably covered with the sauce.
Freezing is not recommended.
The marination has a maximum storage time of 24 hours; beyond this time, it is preferable to discard the liquid as it becomes saturated with fermented substances from the meat and vegetables.
For an even more intense aroma, you can add juniper berries to the marinade.
If you prefer a more rustic texture, you can leave the vegetables in chunks instead of blending them.
What is the best cut for braising? Starting with the type of meat, undoubtedly beef. Veal, tender and juicy, is better suited for quick cooking to appreciate its freshness and delicacy. Conversely, young beef, firmer and less flavorful, is perfect for stews and boiled dishes. The preferred cut is one with a good balance of meat and fat, including connective tissue. These soft parts enhance the quality of the meat, keeping it tender and juicy after cooking. Therefore, the most suitable cut is undoubtedly the beef shoulder.
The double cooking method. Besides choosing the right cut, a double cooking method is crucial for keeping braised beef with Barolo tender. What does it entail? It's quite simple. First, sear the meat in a pan. This seals the surface of the meat, helping it maintain its shape and preventing the juices from escaping during cooking. Then transition to the actual cooking by adding liquid, such as broth or wine in this case, without fully submerging the meat. Otherwise, you would end up with boiled meat, not braised.
Barolo or another wine? Purists rightly insist that braising requires Barolo for this exquisite preparation. Therefore, alternatives such as Bonarda, Nebbiolo, Barbera, or the esteemed Braised Beef with Buttafuoco are not permitted. However, do not be surprised if you find out that the marinating wine is diluted with water. This is a fairly common technique to increase the amount of liquid needed to cover the meat, thus avoiding using more bottles of this noble wine without issues during cooking: the water will evaporate, leaving behind the wine's flavor!
