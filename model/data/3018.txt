To prepare the salmon clafoutis, start by cleaning the fresh scallion: cut the stem , remove the base , and chop it finely .
Wash the baby zucchini carefully, trim them by removing both ends, and then cut them into slices . Place the salmon fillet on the cutting board, slice it into strips, and store it in the fridge until ready to use . Then shell the fresh peas, removing the pod, and transfer them into a small bowl ; you will need 100 g of shelled peas.
Then take the zucchini flowers, wash them by gently immersing them in cold water, then drain them and lay them on a dry cloth, patting them lightly. Transfer them to a cutting board and remove the growths at the base of the calyx . Remove the fleshy pistils inside and divide the flowers in half . Set them aside in the refrigerator; you will add them just before baking the clafoutis.
In a non-stick pan, heat a drizzle of oil and let a peeled clove of garlic brown, then add the chopped scallion and let it sauté. Also add the shelled peas and the baby zucchini cut into slices (11-12). Let them cook over low heat for about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the clafoutis mixture: break the eggs into a bowl and beat them with an electric mixer until well whipped . Then gradually add the milk and finally the flour . Salt and pepper the batter to taste.
Add the dill to the mixture, breaking it with your hands , then pour in the cooked vegetables and stir to combine the mixture .
At this point, butter a shallow mold with a diameter of 10 inches . Pour the mixture into the mold , take the salmon strips out of the fridge and arrange them on the mixture as you like .
Now decorate with the zucchini flowers that you cleaned and divided: arrange them radiantly on the mixture . Once decorated , all that remains is to bake the clafoutis in a preheated oven at 350°F for 30 minutes (if you use a fan oven, bake at 320°F for 20 minutes). When the surface is pleasantly golden, your salmon clafoutis will be ready to be removed from the oven and served hot !
You can store the salmon clafoutis in the refrigerator well covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container for 2-3 days. If you like, you can freeze the salmon clafoutis and defrost it the day before serving. It is advisable to heat it before serving.
Your choice: the vegetables, of course! Additionally: a sprinkle of grated cheese, which almost always goes well… Substitutions: it may seem contradictory since the recipe is called “salmon clafoutis,” but if desired, you can replace the salmon with crispy bacon.
