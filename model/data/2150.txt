instructions:
To prepare the stracciatella cake, start by chopping the chocolate with a knife and set it aside. Next, sift the dry ingredients, so pour the flour, cornstarch , and baking powder into a sieve set over a bowl.
Continue by breaking the room temperature eggs into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and start it while adding the sugar . Let it whip until the mixture becomes light and fluffy, then add the sifted dry ingredients to the mixture. Add a spoonful at a time : add the next only when the previous one is fully incorporated. Soften by adding the room temperature cream
and when it is absorbed, gradually add the vegetable oil . As soon as the batter is ready, detach the bowl from the mixer and gently fold in the chopped chocolate with a spatula using an upward motion, then pour it into a 9.5-inch buttered and floured cake pan .
All that's left is to bake the cake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 40 minutes . Once slightly warm, let it cool completely on a serving plate and finally serve your stracciatella cake . If you prefer, you can decorate it with powdered sugar.
The stracciatella cake can be stored under a glass dome for 2-3 days.
It can be frozen for about a month, even in portions, to thaw as needed.
Luckily, it exists! If you have leftover chocolate, whether dark, milk, or even white, or some leftover chocolate from Easter eggs, repurpose it in this stracciatella cake! If you prefer, you can flavor it with citrus peels, or vanilla, or cinnamon!
