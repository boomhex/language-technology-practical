To prepare the savory popsicles, first, prepare the syrup required for both flavors. In a saucepan, place the water and sugar and bring to a boil . Remove immediately from the heat and let it cool. Move on to the first of the two flavors: wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them in half .
Place them in the blender cup and blend them with an immersion blender until you get a puree .
Strain it through a fine mesh sieve to remove the seeds . Then add the extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of salt .
Add the Tabasco and the previously prepared syrup in a thin stream , always stirring. For convenience, transfer the mixture into a small jug, and distribute it in 2 popsicle molds of 24 oz capacity each, in which you have previously placed the appropriate sticks .
Now distribute the basil leaves into the molds, making them sink well into the mixture . Transfer your cherry tomato popsicles to the freezer, where they should remain for at least 6 hours. Then move on to the second type of popsicles. Cut 4 thin slices of cucumber and keep them aside (they will be used for decoration) , peel the remaining part
and cut the flesh into pieces . Transfer it to the blender cup ; then take the lemon, divide it in half, and take 2 quarters of slices for decoration. Squeeze the rest of the lemon to extract the juice ,
to be added to the cucumber pulp and blend to obtain a puree . Strain it through a fine mesh sieve .
Then add the remaining syrup (about 2.5 oz) , extra virgin olive oil , and a pinch of salt .
Clean the ginger and cut it into pieces the size of garlic cloves, so you can squeeze it with a garlic press , to extract a juice to add to the mixture. Finally, season with pepper and mix.
Place the cucumber and lemon slices inside the popsicle molds . Also transferring the mixture into a jug to simplify the operation, pour the cucumber, ginger, and lemon puree into the molds and transfer them to the freezer for at least 6 hours. After the freezing time, unmold your savory popsicles and enjoy them immediately!
Savory popsicles can be stored in the freezer for over 1 week.
