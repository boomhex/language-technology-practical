instructions:
To prepare the fried chicken, start by cutting the chicken breast into small pieces . Place the meat cubes in a bowl, add salt and pepper and set aside. In another bowl, beat the eggs .
Add the beaten egg , mix , and let it marinate in the refrigerator for about an hour. Prepare the batter: in another bowl, combine the flour and cornstarch .
Also add the baking powder . Then slowly pour in the cold water , carefully stirring with the whisk until you obtain a smooth, lump-free cream.
Pour the batter into the bowl with the chicken and mix well . Heat the oil in a pan or wok and, when it is hot, at about 356°F, dip the chicken pieces .
Fry them until golden, then drain them , place them on a tray lined with paper towels . Serve the fried chicken hot, accompanied with the sweet and sour sauce .
We recommend consuming the fried chicken immediately to preserve its crispness.
You can accompany the fried chicken with sweet and sour sauce or with spicy sauce.
