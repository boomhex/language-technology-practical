The Mediterranean region? Oh, it's all about seafood delights. And look, the shi drum —also known as ombrina—is a real gem, especially around the Italian coast. And it's got this delicate flavor and super firm, moist meat. Perfect for gentle cooking. You know, like steaming or the fancy "en papillote" method. When you're figuring out how to clean shi drum , freshness is your best friend. Check for clear corneas, vivid skin, and meat that springs back. Seriously good stuff.
In places like Liguria and the Tyrrhenian coast, this fish is a local favorite. And here's the deal: locals have their tools down—a sharp blade, a scaler for those fine golden scales, and yeah, a trusty pair of scissors. You gotta have these for perfect preparation.
And look, I get it, many find filleting shi drum a bit daunting. But with practice, really, it’s straightforward. The barbel under the lower jaw? Yep, that’s the sign. And from there, gentle is the name of the game. You want to avoid damaging the tender meat. And do not forget to remove all the guts and fins, leaving no bones behind. Tweezers—seriously handy for this.
What's awesome about shi drum cleaning techniques is that after the descaling—pretty simple—the rest is easy. Italian cooks keep it simple, letting the natural sweet taste of the fish shine. Once filleted, it's ready for anything from light broths to exquisite seafood masterpieces.
Learning these skills in preparing shi drum for cooking not only boosts your confidence but also connects you to one of the Mediterranean’s finest traditions. And you know what? Once you've got it down, you'll get why the shi drum is so, so cherished here. It's a bit of effort, but totally worth it.
To clean and fillet the shi drum, first take the fish and proceed by scaling it with the appropriate scaler tool or alternatively with the blade of a knife . Rub the scaler from the tail along the whole body of the fish until you reach the head. Repeat the operation until you get a completely scaled fish. It is advisable to perform this operation under plenty of running water to facilitate the removal of scales from the body and avoid dirtying the work surface. The scaling operation must be carried out for all preparations of the shi drum except when cooked on a grill or in a salt crust. Then place the shi drum on a cutting board and make a cut in the belly of the animal along its entire length with scissors . You will see the entrails in the belly: remove them with your hands .
Wash the fish's belly thoroughly to remove the bitter taste . Then proceed to fillet the shi drum: with a sharp-bladed knife, cut along the back of the fish, corresponding to the line of the dorsal fins . The cut must be made deeply, down to the fish bone to separate the meat from the central bone .
Then proceed by separating the fillet from the head of the animal making a sharp cut at the gills. For this operation, it is preferable to slightly angle the knife . Then proceed on the other side of the fish to obtain the second half of the fillet by detaching the meat from the bone .
Using a small knife, remove the reddish nerves located in the central part of each fillet . Now gently remove the visible bones from the fish's belly with a knife , being careful not to break the meat. Proceed by removing the remaining bones with a pair of tweezers . Your shi drum fillets are now ready to be used.
You can store the shi drum fillets in the refrigerator for up to 1 day, in an airtight container.
It is also possible to freeze the shi drum fillets: place the fillets on parchment paper and put them in the freezer for 1 hour. Once hardened, transfer them to a freezer bag and place them back in the freezer.
