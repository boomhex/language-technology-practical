To prepare the spicy chili pepper jam, start with the bell peppers: wash them, dry them, and cut off the top part , then halve them lengthwise and remove the internal white filaments and seeds . Finally, cut them into pieces .
At this point, put on a pair of gloves and proceed the same way with the chili peppers: wash them, remove the stem , halve them lengthwise and remove the seeds , finally cut the chili peppers into pieces as well .
Place the chopped bell peppers and chili peppers in a large pot and add the granulated sugar , salt , and wine , and cook over very low heat.
Cover the pot with a lid , making sure to leave a vent for steam, and cook for about an hour. Use this time to proceed with sanitizing the jars and lids, as indicated in the Ministry of Health guidelines provided at the end of the recipe. Once this operation is completed, return to your jam: turn off the heat and pass everything through a food mill , spending ample time on the skins to extract as much pulp as possible.
Once you have finished straining the chili peppers, you will obtain a homogeneous pulp . At this point, put the mixture back on low heat and cook, stirring often and skimming if necessary to remove the white layer that can form on the surface during cooking. Cook for 30 minutes, until the jam has become thick .
After 30 minutes, perform the plate test: take a little of the mixture with a teaspoon and let a drop fall onto a plate; it should stay compact , this is the proof that your jam is ready. If the drop slides away and does not remain compact, continue cooking for the necessary time, stirring frequently. Turn off the heat and transfer the hot jam into the jars you previously sanitized: use a ladle and a funnel for jams . Fill the jars leaving 1/2 inch from the rim, then screw on the lids tightly but not overly so. Let cool: with the heat of the jam, a vacuum will form, allowing the product to be preserved for a long time. Once the jars have cooled, check if the vacuum has formed correctly: you can press in the center of the lid, and if you do not hear the classic "click-clack," the vacuum has formed . Your spicy chili pepper jam is ready to be enjoyed!
Spicy chili pepper jam can be stored for about 3 months, provided the vacuum has formed correctly and the jars are stored in a cool, dry place away from sources of light and heat. It is recommended to wait at least 2-3 weeks before consuming the jam. Once each jar is opened, store in the refrigerator and consume within 3-4 days maximum.
Essential technical note: Obtain gloves, put them on, and do not remove them until you have finished cleaning and cutting the chili peppers. Now that your eyes are safe, we can discuss something else, such as the fact that running the two halves of the chili peppers under running water will help you extract the seeds more easily.
The homemade preparation of preserves and jams can pose health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the conditions and measures necessary to ensure the safety and suitability of the food, which, on the other hand, industrial procedures can guarantee to prevent dangerous contamination. It is therefore important to scrupulously follow food safety guidelines to reduce risks, but one must always keep in mind that the same level of food safety as professionally produced preserves and jams cannot be achieved. For the correct preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the Ministry of Health guidelines .
