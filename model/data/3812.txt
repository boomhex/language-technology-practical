To prepare the vegetable tabbouleh, bring the water to a boil , lightly salted, and in the meantime, pour the bulgur into a bowl and add the hot water on top .
Stir and cover the bowl with a kitchen towel , let it rest for an hour. While the bulgur rehydrates, prepare the dressing: wash the tomatoes, parsley, and mint. Cut the tomatoes in half and remove the seeds and excess juice .
Dice them . Finely chop the parsley and mint. Peel the onion and dice it finely .
Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and season with salt , oil , and the juice of 2 lemons . Mix well and set aside.
Stir the bulgur to separate the grains and add it to the vegetables , mix again, and serve your tabbouleh with vegetables .
Tabbouleh is also excellent the next day. Store it in the refrigerator, covering the bowl with plastic wrap.
You can substitute bulgur with an equal weight of couscous. For a richer taste, you can add spices like turmeric or cumin. Furthermore, you can replace raw vegetables with grilled ones like eggplants or peppers. Tradition has it that the seasoned vegetables are mixed with hands, slightly squeezing them between fingers, so they release their juices and the flavors meld well.
