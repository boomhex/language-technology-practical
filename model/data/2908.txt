To make penne with broccoli and fennel salmon, start by cleaning the broccoli: wash the broccoli, separate the florets from the central stalk , cut the stalks of the florets and set them aside. Remove the hardest outer part of the central stalk and cut it into pieces.
Place a steamer on the stove, pour in the water, and flavor it with a sprig of fennel and peppercorns and also place the broccoli stalks inside . Place the basket in the steamer and add the broccoli florets , steam for about 10 minutes.
Once cooked, drain the broccoli (you can save the steamer water to cook the pasta). Pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, then transfer the broccoli florets , sauté them for a few minutes. Bring a pot full of salted water to a boil (alternatively, you can use the broccoli cooking water) and cook the pasta inside for the time indicated on the package . Clean the salmon using tweezers, remove any bones present in the flesh, then cut the salmon fillet first into strips
and then into cubes and add it to the broccoli , sauté the salmon for a minute over high heat to just sear it. Lightly salt and season with a sprig of wild fennel .
In the meantime, check the pasta's cooking, when it is al dente, drain it and transfer it to the pan with the salmon and broccoli . Sauté the pasta in the pan for a few moments, stirring so that it absorbs the flavors . Your penne with broccoli is ready to be served hot!
It is recommended to consume the penne with salmon and broccoli immediately. If any pasta remains, we suggest storing it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one day. Freezing is not recommended.
If you do not like broccoli, you can replace them with zucchini. Alternatively, you can flavor the steaming water with other herbs such as thyme, sage, or rosemary instead of wild fennel.
