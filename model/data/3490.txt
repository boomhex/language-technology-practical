instructions:
To make the salmon burger, first boil 2 small potatoes for about 30 minutes or until they are soft ; you can check the consistency by piercing the flesh with a fork. Meanwhile, remove the skin from the salmon and extract any bones, then cut it into chunks about 3/4 inch in size .
Transfer the salmon cubes to the mixer, then also add the breadcrumbs, the egg , salt, and pepper .
Season with chopped parsley , pour a drizzle of oil , and blend everything until you obtain a homogeneous consistency. Pour the mixture into a bowl .
Meanwhile, the potatoes will be cooked, place them in the potato ricer and collect the puree in the bowl with the salmon mixture . Mix well to combine everything . Now form the burgers: with slightly dampened hands, take 1/4 of the mixture .
Form a ball and then flatten it to get the typical disc shape . As you form the burgers, place them on a tray . Proceed to cooking: heat a splash of oil in a non-stick pan and add the burgers .
Cook until golden , then flip them and continue cooking on the other side , it will take about 2-3 minutes per side. Once ready, serve your salmon burgers hot, accompanied by your favorite sauces !
Once cooked, it is preferable to consume the salmon burgers immediately.
Salmon burgers can be frozen raw only if you have used fresh fish.
You can enhance the flavor of your burger by adding a teaspoon of mustard to the mixture!
