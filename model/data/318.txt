Mix well , then incorporate the dry ingredients into the liquid ones . Blend everything with a hand whisk until you get a smooth and homogeneous batter .
Butter two 8-inch springform pans, place a circle of parchment paper on the bottom, then flour the edges. Divide the batter equally between the pans . Place both pans on the lower rack of the oven and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 35 minutes . During the last few minutes, check the cooking by doing the toothpick test. This recipe does not include soaking, so it's important that the cakes don't overbake to maintain a fairly moist batter. Once baked, remove from the oven and let cool completely. Meanwhile, prepare the frosting: in a stand mixer, put the mascarpone and cream cheese, then add the fresh cream .
Add the powdered sugar and whip with the whisk until you get a fairly firm cream . You can follow the same procedure using a bowl and an electric mixer. Transfer the cream to a piping bag with a smooth nozzle of 10-12 mm diameter. Once the cakes have cooled, remove them from the pans and, if necessary, cut off the dome to lay it without problems on a serving plate. Add a layer of cream about 1.5-2 cm thick on the surface .
Level the cream , then place the second cake on top with the dome facing down . Spread the frosting on the sides creating vertical stripes .
Add cream on the surface as well , then with a spatula spread it evenly to cover the entire cake . At this point, press the shredded coconut onto the sides of the cake .
Pipe cream puffs along the edge of the surface using a fluted nozzle . Finally, decorate the center with dehydrated coconut flakes . Let the cake rest in the refrigerator for at least 2-3 hours before serving. Your filled coconut cake is ready to be enjoyed !
The filled coconut cake can be stored in the refrigerator, in a closed container or well-covered with plastic wrap, for 2-3 days.
You can replace cow's milk with a coconut-based plant drink to further enhance the flavor.
Instead of mascarpone, you can use only cream cheese or vice versa.
For this cake, shredded coconut is used: it is grated coconut in small flakes, not to be confused with coconut flour, as the two ingredients are not interchangeable.
