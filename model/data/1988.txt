instructions:
To prepare the savory sbrisolona, place both types of almonds in a mixer and coarsely blend them. At this point, cut the butter into cubes and transfer it into a fairly large bowl . Also add the almonds ,
the fine cornmeal and the all-purpose flour . Then add the grated zest of one lemon ,
pepper and salt . Mix with your hands , then add the Parmesan
and the egg yolks . Mix again with your hands without kneading but using only your fingertips to obtain a crumbly mixture .
At this point preheat the oven to 356°F in static mode and butter a 12-inch diameter baking pan. With your hands, transfer 2/3 of the dough into the pan , spreading the mixture over the entire surface without pressing it; the dough should not be compact .
Cut the provolone cheese into slices and place them on top of the mixture , then add the slices of cooked ham and cover with the dough crumbs , spreading them over the entire surface.
Finish with a sprinkle of Parmesan and a pinch of black pepper . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F and cook the savory sbrisolona for 50 minutes. Then remove from the oven and serve it still warm.
Freezing is not recommended. You can store in the refrigerator covered for 1-2 days and warm up before serving.
You can fill it with cheese to your liking such as caciocavallo or fontina. Instead of cooked ham, you can use speck.
