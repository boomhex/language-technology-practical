Savory French toast flips the usual sweet breakfast on its head. It is exciting and really different. Start with thick slices of bread soaked in a rich egg mixture.

So here's the thing—this combo gives you a brunch that's filling and feels a bit fancy, yet pretty simple. In France, people love this kind of savory French toast for breakfast or brunch, swapping toppings based on what's around. Some might toss on herbed cheese, while others might go for fresh greens or a dash of Parmesan for extra flavor. The creamy and crispy textures? Seriously good.
Thing is, part of the fun is mixing it up, so you can try different savory French toast variations depending on your mood or what's in the fridge. Maybe you're going all out with hollandaise or roasted veggies. For sure, it's an easy way to make a quick lunch—just pile on some savory French toast with cheese and a side of salad. This dish works with so many combos if you want something golden and comforting, like adding chopped herbs to the egg mix or trying a savory brunch idea with bacon and tomatoes. And for a tangy twist, you could mix in some goat cheese or swap the salmon for ham.
The great thing is, savory French toast doesn't have to follow any rules—it's all about what really tastes good to you. Plus, if you ever crave something sweet instead, classic French toast pairs wonderfully with mascarpone and strawberries, apples, or even ricotta and chocolate. The moist bread and all those toppings make it feel like a real treat, whether you are sharing with friends or enjoying a cozy morning at home. Can't go wrong.
