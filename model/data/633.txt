instructions:
To prepare the savory bundt cake with cheese and friarielli, dissolve the yeast in water and add it to the manitoba flour .
Knead with your hands . Move to the work surface and form a round dough ball , place it in the bowl, cover with plastic wrap . Let it rise for 1 hour at room temperature or in an off oven at about 79°F, until the dough doubles in size.
Pour into the stand mixer with the dough hook the all-purpose flour, milk , sugar , and the previously risen dough .
Knead until the ingredients are combined and then gradually add the butter . Once combined, add the salt and knead until fully absorbed. Work for a few seconds with your hands, rolling into a round dough ball .
Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap . Let rise at around 79°F for 1 hour. In the meantime, heat the oil in a pan, add the garlic cloves , and then the friarielli , sauté for a few minutes.
Salt and set aside . Cut the provola into strips and then into small cubes , then chop it .
Take the risen dough , roll it out to about 1/6 inch thick to get a rectangle about 14 x 20 inches . Cover the entire surface with friarielli .
Add the provola as well . Roll it up, following the long side , ensuring the filling doesn't come out, seal the edges and place in the fridge to set for about 30 minutes.
Lay the roll on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, make a cut along the long side , keeping one end intact, twist the two ends placing one over the other and keeping the filling facing up . Finish the twist by forming a sort of bundt by attaching the two ends pressing with your fingers .
Make an emulsion with water and oil . Brush it over the surface and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 60 minutes. Place a baking sheet above the bundt to prevent the oven’s coil from over-browning the surface, then remove it 15 minutes before finishing the baking to lightly color the preparation. Take the savory bundt cake with cheese and friarielli out of the oven and serve it warm .
The savory bundt cake with cheese and friarielli can be kept at room temperature for a couple of days, under a glass dome. Freezing is not recommended.
The provola can be replaced with smoked scamorza, and you can also add diced pancetta or sun-dried tomatoes to the filling.
