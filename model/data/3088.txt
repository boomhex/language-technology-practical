They center around lampascioni, which are wild onions with a unique, earthy flavor. Pretty intriguing. At first, they’ve got this slightly bitter taste, but it softens up after a traditional cleaning process. Thing is, it involves soaking them in cold water a bunch of times, so only a mild bitterness stays. Perfect for Italian frittata recipes . The lampascioni get cooked and roughly mashed, then mixed with Grana cheese, parsley, and eggs. And you know what? It creates a flavor that's rich and satisfying. You’ll usually see these fritters served as a rustic antipasto, highlighting their cultural significance in Southern Italy.

If you're all about discovering traditional Italian appetizers or love finding regional Italian specialties off the beaten path, frittatine di lampascioni are really really a different delight.

To prepare the lampascioni omelettes, first clean the lampascioni by removing all the excess soil; then cut off the tip and remove the outer membrane covering them ; finally, cut away the root as well .
Make a cross-cut at the base of each lampascione to prevent them from falling apart too much during cooking. As you clean the lampascioni, place them in a bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning black. The lampascioni should be soaked in cold water for at least 3-4 hours, changing the water several times during this period. The lampascioni will release a pinkish color into the water, and thanks to the various baths, they will lose excess bitterness. Drain the lampascioni and
boil them in plenty of salted water for 40-45 minutes (7-8). After this time, check if the lampascioni are ready: they should be tender enough to be mashed with a fork .
Drain the lampascioni and immediately plunge them into cold water . Let them cool, then drain them again .
Dry the lampascioni with a clean cloth and mash them with the help of a fork . Transfer them to a bowl and further mince them with the fork to obtain a coarse puree.
Season the lampascioni puree with half a clove of crushed garlic (or whole, according to your taste) , grated parmesan cheese , a teaspoon of chopped parsley , and mix the ingredients.
Then add the breadcrumbs and finally the eggs, one at a time, previously beaten . Salt and pepper, then mix with the fork to obtain a homogeneous and soft mixture .
In the meantime, place olive oil in a large non-stick pan and heat it; as soon as it is hot, take a spoonful of the mixture at a time and fry your omelettes by sliding the mixture directly into the oil . Shape the omelettes as evenly as possible using 2 spoons. Fry them for 2 minutes on each side, turning them carefully , and once golden brown, drain your lampascioni omelettes on absorbent paper . If you want lighter omelettes, you can bake them in a preheated oven at 400°F for about 10-15 minutes, turning them halfway through. Serve your lampascioni omelettes hot!
These lampascioni fritters can be stored covered in the fridge for a couple of days and then reheated in the oven for a few minutes. We do not recommend freezing the omelettes, but if desired, you can freeze the lampascioni: after soaking, cook them in boiling water for 30 minutes, keeping them intact and not too soft. Cool them in cold water, then dry them and store them in the freezer in a food bag.
We officially declare war on the acidity of these onions. If you are fond of them but find them hard to digest, follow this trick: leave the lampascioni to soak in cold water for at least 24 hours, rinsing them several times. This will reduce the bitterness and acidity, and they will be easier to digest!
