Nestled in the charming town of Cavriana in Lombardy, the Torta di San Biagio recipe is really, really special in Italian culinary tradition. Every February, the community gathers for the San Biagio festival—it's a big deal—and this cake is the heart of the celebration. What makes this dessert unique is the shortcrust pastry. No eggs here, which is kind of rare among Italian sweets. Instead, they use a splash of white wine. Seriously good. It gives the crust a special tender bite and a subtle flavor that pairs perfectly with the sweet filling.
Locals craft this filling with ground almonds, dark chocolate, sugar, and eggs. It's a rich, moist center that's just the right balance of sweetness and nuttiness. The top of the tart? It's artistically arranged with leftover pastry cut into jagged strips. Forms a lattice pattern, letting the glossy, chocolatey filling peek through. From the Gonzaga era to today’s bright festivals, this Cavriana dessert has always been a symbol of community spirit.
Every year, the town bakes a massive three-meter-wide version to serve to hundreds of visitors, keeping this really good tradition alive. The golden crust—achieved by using white wine—melts into the rich filling, creating a balanced blend of flavors. The combo of almonds and chocolate gives a crispy top with a soft, almost creamy bite inside. And here's the thing: each slice tells a story steeped in history. No question people eagerly anticipate this classic San Biagio cake every year.
Even among other Italian festival desserts , this cake stands out because of its deep connection to local culture and history. It's tangy and satisfying, especially with a cup of coffee or tea. Whether you're into traditional recipes or just exploring new flavors, Saint Blaise’s cake is a piece of Mantuan cuisine that offers a unique taste experience. For real.
To prepare the San Biagio cake, start making the shortcrust pastry: blend the cold butter with the flour in a mixer until you get a sandy mixture . Transfer the mixture onto the work surface, shape it into a traditional fountain , and add the sugar .
Mix with your hands and gradually add the white wine in a thin stream . Add the vanilla seeds and knead vigorously with your hands to get a compact and well-blended dough. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, finely break the dark chocolate and chop the almonds in a mixer . In a large bowl, mix the two ingredients and
add the sugar , grated zest of one lemon , and the eggs .
Mix the ingredients well with a spoon . At this point, roll out the shortcrust pastry with a rolling pin to a thickness of 1/5 inch and cover a well-buttered and floured 10.5-inch diameter cake pan .
Remove the excess dough by pressing the edges of the cake pan with the rolling pin and fill the cake with the filling , leveling it well with a spoon .
Knead and roll out the leftover dough again and use a crinkle-edged wheel to cut strips , which you will place on the cake first diagonally , so that they intersect to form diamonds .
Beat one egg and brush the surface of the cake (22-23). Bake the cake in a preheated static oven at 320°F for 45 minutes (convection oven 284°F for 35 minutes) until the surface is colored . Here is your San Biagio tart ready!!
You can store the San Biagio cake under a glass dome for 3-4 days. If you want to prepare it ahead of time, you can make the shortcrust pastry and store it for 3-4 days, covered with plastic wrap, in the fridge, or freeze it for future use.
If you have leftover dough, you can use it to form a braid and place it on the edge of the cake. If you wish, you can also flavor the filling with 20 ml of anise or rum liquor.
The Christian tradition holds that Saint Blaise is the protector of the throat and nose, and in church, on February 3rd, an ancient blessing is renewed: the priest crosses two candles under the chin of the faithful to protect these parts of the body.
