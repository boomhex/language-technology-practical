instructions:
To prepare the chickpea omelette, start with the vegetables. Clean the asparagus, remove the woody part , and use a peeler to remove the outermost tough layer , resulting in about 12 oz of asparagus. Finally, cut them into slices about 3/8 inch thick .
Wash the leek, remove the outer leaves, then slice it into rounds. Wash the bell pepper, cut off the top, split it in half lengthwise, remove the seeds inside , and cut it into strips .
In a non-stick skillet with high edges, 9.5 inches in diameter, heat a splash of oil and add the asparagus , bell peppers , and leek .
Season with thyme , add salt and pepper, and let everything cook for 10 minutes over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, prepare the batter. In a large bowl, pour the chickpea flour, paprika ,
and salt , gradually add the water and beer while stirring with a whisk to prevent lumps from forming.
Also add 2 tsp of olive oil and mix well until a homogeneous mixture is obtained . After the 10 minutes of cooking the vegetables, pour the batter directly into the skillet .
Stir , cover with a lid , and cook over medium heat for about 5-6 minutes. After this time, remove the lid .
Place a plate on top , flip the omelette, then slide it back into the skillet so the uncooked side is in contact with the bottom. Cook the other side for 5 minutes, still over medium heat with the lid on. Remove the lid and continue cooking for another 10 minutes over medium heat, flipping halfway through . When the omelette is cooked, let it rest for about 5 minutes before serving .
The omelette can be stored in the fridge for 2-3 days. It can also be frozen already cut into portions after cooking.
As an alternative to beer, you can use sparkling water. Asparagus and bell peppers can be replaced with other seasonal vegetables of your choice.
