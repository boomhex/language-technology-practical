Brioche bunnies bring a whole lot of Easter fun to the table, especially in Italian homes where traditions mix with a touch of creativity. And these bunny-shaped brioche treats? They’re not just cute to look at—they come with a soft and sweet dough that’s full of flavor, thanks to a little bit of orange and lemon zest. Really, they’re super tasty. The dough is classic and pretty simple to put together. It gets that fresh aroma Italians love for their Easter bread recipes . Thing is, shaping the dough into bunny forms is half the fun, and it’s a playful way to get kids involved in the kitchen.
Compared to the usual big holiday cakes or plain loaves, these little bunnies feel extra special. For sure. They’re golden on the outside and tender on the inside, and you’ll often find them on tables right alongside other traditional Easter baking like dove-shaped colombe or baskets of decorated cookies.
People like to keep these brioche bunnies simple and serve them just as they are. But they’re also really, really good split open and filled with things like chocolate spread or fruity jams. Their moist crumb soaks up any filling, making every bite a little bit different. For Italian Easter brunches, these Easter bunny breads fit right in with other festive bread ideas , and they bring a sense of celebration with their playful shapes. And here's the thing, some regions in Italy go all out with the decorations—little sugar eyes, colorful sprinkles, or a dusting of powdered sugar for extra flair. Seriously good.
It’s all about making food that feels cheerful and a little bit whimsical, just like the holiday itself. Whether you’re making these as a family project or just want to put something different on the table, a batch of bunny bread feels like a simple way to enjoy the light, fluffy texture and the joyful spirit that comes with Italian Easter traditions. It’s easy to see why these bunnies have become a favorite for both kids and adults during the holiday season. No question. They really capture the heart of Easter with their great appearance and hard to resist taste.

To prepare the brioche bunnies, pour the two types of flour , sugar , and crumbled fresh yeast into the bowl of a stand mixer.
Add the milk , grated orange zest , and grated lemon zest .
Turn on the stand mixer, working the ingredients with the hook . When they are mixed, add the room temperature eggs and work until you have an elastic and uniform dough. Add a pinch of salt .
Work again until you have a well-bound dough . At this point, you can add the soft butter to the dough gradually, waiting for each piece to be well absorbed before adding more. Work until fully absorbed .
Transfer the dough onto the work surface and shape it into a ball with your hands. Transfer the dough to a large bowl , cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise at room temperature for about 3 hours.
When the dough has doubled in volume , transfer it onto a slightly buttered surface. Now proceed to form the bunnies. From the dough, you should obtain 10 pieces of 50 g (1.75 oz) for the bodies, 20 pieces of 20 g (0.7 oz) for the ears and faces, and 10 pieces of 5 g (0.18 oz) for the tails . Start with the first bunny. Take one of the 50 g (1.75 oz) pieces and begin to roll it into a log .
When you have a log about 6 inches long , start rolling it onto itself , leaving the last piece unrolled. Now make the bunny's face by taking one of the 20 g (0.7 oz) pieces and forming a ball .
Place the bunny's body on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and position the ball on the top . Now take one of the 20 g (0.7 oz) pieces, flatten it slightly, and cut it with a 1.25-inch heart-shaped cutter . With a small knife, make an incision at the center of the heart ,
to create the ears . Place the ears on the head, applying slight pressure. Finally, take one of the 5 g (0.18 oz) pieces and form a small ball for the tail .
Then place the ball on the lower right side, applying slight pressure . Repeat this operation to form all 10 bunnies, spacing them well apart on two baking sheets. Let them rise away from drafts at room temperature for 60 minutes . Now whisk the yolk with the cream
and use it to brush the bunnies . Bake in a static oven at 356°F for 25 minutes, on the middle rack. Remove from the oven and let them cool before serving.
Brioche bunnies can be stored at room temperature for 2 days under a glass dome. Alternatively, they can be frozen after baking.
You can use the same amount of milk instead of cream, together with the yolk, to brush the bunnies. For a successful result, it's important to add the butter very slowly. Flavor the dough with vanilla seeds or cinnamon. If you prefer, you can make the bunnies following the eggless pan brioche recipe or our Chocolate Brioche Bread !
