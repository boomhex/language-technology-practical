instructions:
To prepare the grandmother's cake with pistachio, first make the shortcrust pastry. Pour the flour, baking powder , and sugar into a bowl. Also add the eggs and a pinch of salt.
Also add cold butter cut into pieces and quickly knead everything in the bowl . When you have obtained a homogeneous mixture, work a few more moments on a surface and wrap the dough in plastic wrap . Leave to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the pistachio custard cream. In a saucepan, pour the starch, sugar, and salt ; also add the egg yolks and pistachio paste . At this point, while stirring with a whisk, pour the milk little by little .
Mix well, then transfer the mixture to the heat and stir continuously for a few minutes until the cream has thickened . At this point, transfer it to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap in contact . Then let it cool at room temperature.
When the cream is well chilled, take the shortcrust from the fridge and divide it in half. Roll out each of the two parts between two sheets of parchment paper, using a rolling pin. You need to get a thickness of about 1/4 inch . At this point, take a 10-inch diameter cake pan, butter it and flour it. With the help of parchment paper, transfer one of the two discs of shortcrust inside . Make the dough adhere well to the edges and remove the excess using a small knife. Then prick the base with a fork .
Pour the pistachio custard cream inside , level it well with a spatula , and close with the other disc, then seal the edges by pressing them slightly with your fingers . This way you will also remove the excess dough.
As a last step, prick the top of the cake again with the fork. Brush the surface with milk and sprinkle with pistachio crumbs . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 40-45 minutes. Once baked , let it cool completely. Then transfer it to a plate, sprinkle it with powdered sugar, and serve.
Store the grandmother's cake in the fridge for a couple of days.
The shortcrust can be frozen for 1 month.
The cream can be stored in the fridge for 2-3 days.
Instead of pistachio paste, you can use a spreadable pistachio cream, but you will need to reduce the sugar in the cream by about 4 1/2 oz.
