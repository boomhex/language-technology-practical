When you're in Naples , you absolutely can't miss the caffè napoletano . It's not just any coffee—it's really a unique blend of tradition and flavor that locals just, you know, adore. I mean, the star here? It's gotta be the hazelnut cream. Really good stuff. This creation is made by blending rich whipped cream with hazelnut paste until it's a mousse-like dream. And then, it's placed on top of a robust espresso brewed in a classic caffettiera napoletana —which is great. This gives you a caffè alla napoletana that's both luxurious and comforting, with a perfect mix of sweetness and nutty flavors.
You’ll see folks enjoying these in bustling bars all over Naples. For real, it's something special. What's fascinating about espresso napoletano is the local pride. Neapolitans have, like, totally mastered the art of coffee, and that hazelnut mousse? So so indulgent. It's not just about getting your caffeine fix—it's about the smooth, almost dessert-like texture, and the good balance of bitter and sweet. Pretty simple, right?
This style really captures the heart of caffè tradizionale in Southern Italy, where every sip is an experience. Whether you're laughing with friends or enjoying a quiet moment, a caffè partenopeo with hazelnut cream is something you'll want to savor. The glass cup presentation adds to the appeal—it's a visual delight.
And look, if you're a fan of the Neapolitan way of life and that deep-rooted coffee culture, this drink totally has the spirit and tradition of Naples. It's a must-try for any coffee lover. Can't go wrong.
To prepare Neapolitan coffee, start by making the hazelnut cream: heat the cream in a saucepan and add the hazelnut paste , which should melt. Also add the sugar syrup , mix with a whisk to combine, then transfer the mixture to a bowl and let it cool at room temperature .
Once cooled, cover the cream with a sheet of plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator overnight. When it is well chilled, add 20 ml (0.68 oz) of cold coffee and whip the hazelnut cream with an electric mixer . Place it back in the fridge to rest.
In the meantime, prepare the coffee with the coffee maker: to obtain excellent coffee, fill the boiler of your coffee maker with cold, low-limescale water, taking care not to exceed the safety valve (otherwise you will get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee forming a small mound that you will level by tapping the filter on the table with firm movements (8-9). Do not press with a spoon or make holes on the surface.
Close the coffee maker very tightly , so that the coffee doesn't come out from the sides while it rises, and place it on a low, steady flame to obtain a strong coffee. As the coffee rises, a dense foam will form : we recommend not letting the coffee gurgle for too long to keep its sweetness and aroma intact. Your coffee is ready: before using, stir it directly in the moka with a teaspoon to make the coffee more homogeneous .
Once ready, pour 40 ml (1.35 oz) of coffee into each glass cup and add 30 ml (1 oz) of hazelnut cream . Finally, decorate the glass with a pinch of coffee powder : your Neapolitan coffee is ready!
Enjoy the Neapolitan coffee immediately. The hazelnut cream can be stored for three days in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap: when you need it, just whip it again with the whisk.
Usually, commercial hazelnut paste has a very oily part and a more compact one. For this recipe, we recommend using only the compact part, do this: drain the oil into a bowl, take the amount of hazelnut paste you need and put the oil back inside. You can also prepare the sugar syrup at home if you can't find it ready-made, by melting together equal amounts of water and sugar.
