instructions:
To make the rustic cream puffs with bacon and walnuts, first prepare the choux pastry: pour the water into a saucepan along with the butter and salt and bring to a boil.
Add the flour all at once and stir vigorously with a whisk over low heat until the mixture comes together and detaches from the bottom of the saucepan . Transfer the mixture to a bowl and let it cool.
Now add one egg at a time , mixing well with the whisk to incorporate it. Only when the egg is completely absorbed can you add the next one: in the end, the mixture should be smooth and consistent . Add the grated cheese .
Also add the diced bacon and roughly chopped walnuts , reserving some for the final garnish, then mix again with the whisk to combine everything .
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and drop spoonfuls of the mixture onto it, spacing the mounds apart . Slightly flatten the top with the back of a spoon and garnish with the walnuts and bacon you set aside .
Finally, add the sesame seeds and bake in a preheated fan oven at 356°F for about 20 minutes . Once baked, the rustic cream puffs with bacon and walnuts should be puffed up and golden . Let them cool slightly and serve!
The rustic cream puffs with bacon and walnuts can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, making sure to reheat them in the oven before serving. Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer, you can replace the bacon with diced cooked ham or smoked salmon.
