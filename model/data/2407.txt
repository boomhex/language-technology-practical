Beer can chicken —such a wild dish, right? People love it at backyard gatherings because it’s kinda unique and, you know, super tasty. The whole idea of a chicken perched on a beer can while cooking is just fun to watch. And look, in the States, it's a real conversation starter. The beer steams up inside, making the meat super moist. Meanwhile, the outside gets nice and crispy, with that golden skin everyone loves.
Now, here’s the deal: folks add their own twists with spice rubs. Stuff like paprika, garlic, and salt. Maybe a dash of rosemary—if you’re feeling fancy. And the sauce? Sometimes they mix broth with Worcestershire and inject it right into the chicken. Really, it's a game-changer for flavor. It is always tender, juicy, and pretty much perfect.
When you're doing oven roasted beer can chicken , there's no need for a grill. Pop it on a roasting stand in your oven and let the magic happen. Seriously good. The setup even catches fat drippings, so you get amazing flavor without the mess. Baked beer can chicken still gives that fun presentation, and the beer keeps it all moist inside, packed with taste.
Some folks go all in with a double-layer roasting pan, adding fresh herbs like rosemary or thyme. Makes the kitchen smell tangy and inviting. Really really good. Every time you pull out a beer can chicken recipe like this, it’s exciting. And listen, when you slice into that juicy, crispy skin and see the tender insides, it’s something else.
This dish is as fun to make as it is to eat. I mean, it always gets people smiling and asking for seconds. Anyone wanting a new twist on beer can chicken in the oven or just something fun for dinner is gonna love this classic American fave. Can't go wrong with that!
To prepare the oven beer can chicken, start by preparing the Beef Broth , then proceed to make the rub. Place the brown sugar in a mortar and begin to grind it with the pestle. Once you have a fine powder, add the paprika and grind again. Add the oregano and grind .
Add the chili pepper , salt , and pepper , continuing to grind. The mixture should be very fine.
Dip a brush in the melted butter and lightly drizzle it over all parts of the chicken . Then begin to sprinkle the rub over the entire surface , both outside and inside the chicken, and massage well with your hands so that the aromas penetrate the fibers to flavor the meat . Wrap the chicken in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least a couple of hours.
For the injections: take the previously prepared and cooled meat broth and add the Worcestershire sauce, draw the liquid with a meat syringe and inject it into the chicken's muscles , extracting the syringe as you insert the liquid. This movement allows better distribution of the liquids inside. During the injection, the tissues will swell, indicating a correct infiltration of the liquids. A large part will still be lost but the result will be very moist and juicy meat. Pour the beer into the central part of the special chicken cooking tray with the can, and add a sprig of rosemary .
Place the chicken in the holder and bake in a preheated static oven at 383°F for about 45/50 minutes. A quick side dish can be made with baked potatoes. Wash the potatoes well, and without removing the skin, wrap them in aluminum foil (14-15), then place them on a second tray to be placed on the lowest rack of the oven. Cook together with the chicken for the same time and at the same temperature.
After about 50 minutes, remove the chicken and the potatoes from the oven. Serve your oven beer chicken still hot and accompany it with wedges of baked potatoes !
Store the oven beer can chicken in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
If you have the opportunity, you can let the chicken marinate overnight if you prefer even more aromatic and fragrant meat.
If you can't find a meat syringe, use a syringe with a thick needle!
Accompany your potatoes with some sour cream!
