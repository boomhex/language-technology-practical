instructions:
To make patatas bravas, wash and peel the potatoes with a peeler or paring knife , cut them into small chunks , and set them aside. In a small bowl, place the tomato sauce
and the vinegar , mix the sauce and keep it for seasoning the potatoes. In a large skillet, pour the olive oil , then add the potato wedges
pepper , salt , and fry the potatoes for 5 minutes. Then cover with a lid , lower the heat, and cook for about another 20 minutes, checking the cooking occasionally and stirring the potatoes with a spoon, being careful not to break them.
After this time, flavor the potatoes with paprika , increase the heat, add the tomato sauce with red wine vinegar , and cook for another 3 minutes to let the sauce absorb. Now your patatas bravas are ready to be enjoyed as in Spain: serve them in small terracotta bowls skewered with toothpicks, they will be a hit!
You can store patatas bravas in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Considering the simplicity of the preparation, freezing is not recommended.
The recipe we propose is the original one, but you can adjust the spices based on your palate's tolerance: at the 'very spicy' extreme, we find Tabasco, for true daredevils! Those who wish to lighten them a bit can replace olive oil with seed oil: the frying will be very delicate!
