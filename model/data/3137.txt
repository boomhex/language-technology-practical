To prepare the panna cotta filled eggs, start by soaking the gelatin in cold water for about 10 minutes . Place a saucepan on the stove with the cream and half a vanilla bean with its seeds .
Add the sugar and heat the mixture to dissolve the sugar, stirring with a spoon . Squeeze the gelatin and add it to the mixture , then stir to dissolve it and turn off the heat.
Strain the panna cotta to remove the vanilla bean and let it cool, covered with cling film. Meanwhile, gently open the eggs in half : for this recipe, we used eggs with a white chocolate interior, but you can use entirely milk or dark chocolate eggs. To reinforce the eggs (especially if they are milk chocolate) that might melt when we pour in the panna cotta, and to create a contrast with the panna cotta, melt the dark chocolate in a bain-marie or microwave and
brush the inside of the eggs with it , then place them immediately in the freezer for a couple of minutes. Take the now cold eggs and fill them one at a time, placed in a small bowl in case they melt at the bottom, with the panna cotta . Place the filled eggs in the freezer for 10-15 minutes, and when they have cooled down, let them thicken in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. Once set, garnish with chocolate shavings your panna cotta filled eggs!
To prepare the tiramisu filled eggs, start by preparing the mascarpone cream: separate the yolks from the egg whites and beat the yolks with half of the sugar indicated in the total recipe amount , using either a hand whisk or an electric mixer. When they become white and frothy, add the mascarpone and mix well with a whisk .
Separately, beat the egg whites , and when they are semi-whipped, add the other half of the sugar and continue to beat until you get a shiny and firm mixture .
Gently fold the egg whites into the yolk and mascarpone mixture, stirring from bottom to top to achieve a homogeneous mixture (7-8), and finally add a teaspoon of coffee powder .
Meanwhile, break only the upper part of the chocolate eggs . Use aluminum foil to prepare 4 supports to keep the eggs upright (or use small cocottes if you have them): fold an 8 cm long strip of aluminum foil several times on itself and then shape it into a small ring . Position the eggs on them to keep them upright .
Now assemble the tiramisu: break the ladyfinger into 3 parts, soak it in cold coffee, and place it at the bottom of the egg . Then pipe a layer of mascarpone cream from a pastry bag , continue with another piece of ladyfinger soaked in coffee, and then the cream again .
Fill all the eggs in this way and finally dust the surface of the cream with cocoa powder and decorate with a coffee bean placed in the center : here are your tiramisu filled eggs!
To prepare the orange mousse filled eggs, start by making the Italian meringue: place a small pan on the stove with the water and sugar . Leave it on low heat and meanwhile, using a stand mixer or an electric hand mixer, whip the egg whites with a pinch of salt . When the sugar syrup reaches a temperature of 250°F ,
add it slowly to the egg whites and continue to whip until you get a foamy and shiny mixture . Soften the gelatin in cold water .
Now, place another pan on the stove with the sugar, the grated zest of half an orange , and the orange juice : dissolve the sugar, and when ready, remove from heat, let it cool, and gradually add it to the meringue .
Mix the meringue and orange syrup , then take a little of the mixture and dissolve the well-squeezed gelatin in it . If necessary, heat the mixture in the microwave to dissolve the gelatin faster. In a stand mixer or with an electric hand mixer, work the fresh cream until it is semi-whipped, soft, and foamy.
Gently fold the cream into the mixture and finally add the part where you dissolved the gelatin . Cover and leave the mousse in the refrigerator to set for at least an hour .
After this time, transfer the mixture into a pastry bag and fill the chocolate eggs , breaking only the upper part as in the tiramisu filled eggs recipe. Decorate the eggs with some orange pieces and a mint leaf , and here are your orange mousse filled eggs .
Keep the filled eggs in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. It is not recommended to freeze them.
We wouldn't want to waste the upper part of the eggs, would we? It's perfect as a decoration (or to nibble on secretly, as it wasn't needed, right?). If you don't like orange, don't worry and freely replace it with other citrus fruits, like tangerines or lemons: just stick to the quantities.
