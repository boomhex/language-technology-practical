To prepare the potato towers on flatbread, start by taking the potatoes. Wash the potatoes carefully and peel them with a peeler . Cut the potatoes into fairly thin slices (about 1/8 inch) using a mandoline ; if you don't have one, you can perform the same operation with a knife. Be careful to cut the potatoes keeping them straight, to obtain slices that are as round and regular as possible. At this point, place the potato slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and drizzle them with a little oil .
Bake in a preheated oven at 480°F for 10 minutes (if using a fan oven, 450°F for 5/6 minutes) until golden. While the potatoes cool slightly , cut the cheese into thin slices with which you will compose the towers . Now start composing the potato tower: place the cheese slices, salt, pepper, and rosemary on the first potato slice. Then overlap a second potato slice and season again with cheese slices, salt, pepper, and rosemary . Proceed in the same way until you form a "tower" composed of four potato slices and three layers of cheese.
When you have composed all the towers, place them in a non-stick baking pan and bake in a preheated oven at 480°F in static mode for 1 minute (if using a fan oven, 450°F), to melt the fontina. Carefully place your towers on the flatbreads and decorate with a rosemary sprig . Your potato towers on flatbread are ready, you just need to serve and enjoy them immediately!
The potato towers on flatbread can also be composed the day before: prepare the potato towers but do not bake them immediately, instead keep them in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container. The next day, just bake the potato towers for a minute and place them on the flatbread.
Delicious in their simplicity, the potato towers can be customized in a thousand ways. How? By pretending they are sandwiches, of course! Between one potato and another, you can insert aromatic herbs (like parsley or chives) to make them fresher, or a slice of cooked ham, to add flavor.
