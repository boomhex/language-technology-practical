Golden color and creamy look set Risotto Pannerone e Pere apart on any dinner table—the dish feels both comforting and slightly fancy, making it easy to see why families reach for it when they want something beyond the usual easy meals . The first forkful brings a soft , smooth feel balanced by that unique Pannerone cheese from Lodi (definitely a treat if you’re after new flavors), all mixed together with the sweet, juicy taste of ripe pears. Together, this risotto creates a good balance of slightly bitter, cheesy notes and natural fruit sweetness...something a little different from most budget-friendly cooking but still feeling familiar to kids and grown-ups alike. Warmth, a beautiful creamy finish, and that nicely blended rich flavor make it a regular win for busy folks who don’t want yet another plain dish on family evenings. Special occasions or just a simple Thursday night—this risotto looks really welcoming, almost like an invitation for everyone to dig in and enjoy a DELICIOUS family meal.
Home cooks quickly notice how reliable Risotto Pannerone e Pere is for both family dinners and flexible entertaining. Since the dish pairs super well with side salads or roast veggies, everyone can enjoy it their own way (kids really like when there’s something a little different but still familiar). The fluffy texture tends to soak up that cheese and pear, always leaving every bite full of big flavor—a nice change when you’re tired of the same old stuff from every day American recipes. Since it feels a little like comfort food, families love bringing it out on cooler nights or when they want a relaxed meal with a touch of tradition in the mix. The simple look—creamy risotto, speckled with little pear pieces—makes serving easy during both special events and quick weeknights because it fits so many types of mealtime plans. For those looking to save time while still keeping a bit of flair, this dish matches up really well with common meal prep strategies and works with almost any approach to traditional baking too. Kids and adults end up asking for seconds pretty often...for good reason: it’s a nice surprise packed with flavor, without the need for any complicated extra cooking equipment or fussy steps. Families absolutely appreciate having something this tasty, flexible, and inviting on hand when real life gets busy.
To prepare pannerone and pear risotto, start by preparing the Vegetable broth . Once ready, finely chop the onion , add both the butter and the oil to a pan , heat it up, and add the onion .
Add a ladle of hot broth and let the sauté soften; then add the rice and toast it, stirring often. Only when it has changed color, you can deglaze with the white wine .
Continue cooking the rice by adding a ladle of broth from time to time and stirring it frequently. In the meantime, cut the pannerone: first into strips and then into cubes .
Wash the pears, divide them into 4, and remove the central core with a small knife without removing the skin , then cut each slice into cubes . When the rice is almost cooked, add the diced pears
and the pannerone cubes . Mix everything well and serve your pannerone and pear risotto .
Store the pannerone and pear risotto for up to one day in the refrigerator, closed in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
To achieve a creamier risotto, you can add 3-4 tablespoons of fresh cream at the end of cooking! If you wish, you can replace the pannerone with taleggio or gorgonzola, not because they resemble it in taste, but because they go well with rice and pears.
