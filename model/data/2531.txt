Bacchette magiche —what a treat! Seriously, these get kids all excited in kitchens across central Italy. You start with a classic pasta frolla base. It's this magical blend of powdered sugar and orange zest that gives it that soft and slightly sweet flavor. Really really good. The fun part? Cutting out those star shapes. Suddenly, the kitchen turns into a workshop full of magic. Everyone gets to make their own edible wands, and you know, it’s not just about baking. It's about turning an afternoon into something festive. That citrus hint? It gives the batch a special touch, making these Italian cookies stand out from store-bought ones. The tradition reflects the joy of Italian family gatherings, where cooking is an experience shared across generations.
Whether it's for festivals, birthdays, or rainy weekends, bacchette magiche add color and joy to any occasion. Once those stars bake up golden and a little crispy at the edges, the decorating begins. And here's the thing: this is where creativity takes over! Kids love covering wands with colorful icing and pressing on shiny silver dragees until every wand sparkles. It's a chance to get messy, share laughs, make memories—while sneaking tastes of moist pastry or drippy icing. Yum! The wands look extra magical when you stand them in a tall glass packed with bright candies. It's a centerpiece that's almost too cute to eat. In central and northern Italy, families pull out recipes like this for celebrations—be it Carnevale, a birthday, or just to see a few smiles.
No wonder these star-shaped treats have become a favorite. They're not only tasty but turn any kitchen into a happy, creative zone for everyone involved. For real, kids end up with sticky fingers, adults end up with a tray of delicate little stars, and everyone enjoys a bit of homemade magic. These delicious wands are a testament to the Italian love for food and family. They bring a sense of joy and togetherness to every gathering—pretty much a win-win for everyone.
To make the magic wands, start with the shortcrust pastry. In a mixer, place the sifted flour, a pinch of salt, and the cold butter cut into cubes . Blend everything until you get a sandy consistency and pour the mixture onto the work surface, adding the sifted powdered sugar .
Create the classic fountain shape, then, after cleaning and drying it well, grate the orange zest incorporating it into the mixture . Now add the egg yolks and with a fork, lightly beat them into the flour to absorb them. You can now proceed with manual processing : knead briefly, just enough to compact the shortcrust pastry.
Now form a dough ball, flatten it slightly, and cover it with cling film . Let it firm up in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. After this time, roll out the shortcrust pastry into a sheet about 0.4 inches thick and cut out stars with a mold about 2.75 inches wide . Gently insert the food-grade stick into the center of the star and place them all on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 20 minutes (if ventilated, at 356°F for 10 minutes). Once baked, let the cookies cool completely.
Meanwhile, prepare the Water Glaze . Heat a small amount of water in a saucepan and gradually add it to the powdered sugar . Use a whisk to dissolve the sugar: if it becomes too liquid, add more, or if it is too thick, dilute with a bit of hot water . Once a smooth and fluid consistency is obtained, divide the icing into two bowls and cover both with cling film .
Proceed now with coloring the icing, keeping one batch covered while you work on the other. Add the yellow food coloring to one of the bowls and the pink food coloring to the other , incorporating the tint well to achieve the desired intensity . Once done, keep the icings covered with cling film until ready to use.
Transfer the now-cooled cookies onto a wire rack. Cover half with the yellow icing and half with the pink icing using a teaspoon or a spatula: start from the center and stop a few millimeters from the edge . Before the icing completely hardens, decorate with the colored beads, placing them on the points with the help of kitchen tweezers . Finally, let the decorated icing dry completely . Your magic wands are ready!
You can store the cookies in a tin box for 4-5 days. The shortcrust pastry can be frozen, wrapped in cling film, for 1 month.
To flavor the shortcrust pastry, you can use the seeds of a vanilla bean as an alternative to the orange zest.
