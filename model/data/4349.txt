An aperitif on the terrace or on the beach at sunset...whatever the atmosphere you choose, the watermelon cocktail will be perfect. Just the name delights and refreshes: seedless watermelon pulp, prosecco base, and lime will be the perfect combination for this vibrant and very pleasant drink. It takes very little time to prepare the watermelon cocktail, so you can focus on accompanying sweets and appetizers, always watermelon-based, such as:

To prepare the watermelon cocktail, start by cutting the fruit. Discard the outer rind and cut the pulp into large pieces . Pour into a blender jug
then blend and keep cool: you will need 2 oz of liquid per glass . Prepare the glasses by pouring in each the cane sugar ,
a few mint leaves, some grated lime zest , and stir . Fill the glass with ice
and pour the prosecco , the blended watermelon pulp , and the lime juice .
Add the soda as well and mix everything together. Complete with a few mint leaves and watermelon skewers (we explain how in the tip at the bottom of the page). Here is the first watermelon cocktail ready, continue like this with all the others !
It is recommended to consume the watermelon cocktail immediately once ready.
Instead of prosecco, try variations based on your tastes like sparkling wine or even a bit of white rum or vermouth! If you don't have soda, sparkling water is just fine.
How to make watermelon skewers? Very simple, use a melon baller to get watermelon spheres and skewer them with a toothpick.
