To prepare prickly pear jam, start by sanitizing the jars, following the Health Ministry's guidelines provided at the end of the recipe. Once this task is done, move on to the prickly pears: first, put on a pair of latex gloves. The simplest way to remove their thick skin is to cut off both ends and make incisions with a sharp knife along the length of the prickly pear, then, using the knife blade, pull the skin towards you . Cut the prickly pear pulp into very small cubes and place them in a pot .
Put the pot on the stove, add the glass of water to the prickly pear pulp . Bring to a boil until the prickly pear cubes are mushy , then remove the pot from the heat and strain the pulp to remove the seeds .
Put the strained pulp back in the saucepan and turn the heat back on; in the meantime, squeeze a lemon . Add the sugar to the pulp and when the mixture comes to a boil again, add the lemon juice . Boil for another 40 minutes, then, when the mixture has thickened well, turn off the heat and pour the hot prickly pear jam into the previously sanitized jars, leaving 0.4 inches of space from the rim. Screw the lids on tightly (but not overly tight) and allow to cool. The heat from the jam will create a vacuum, allowing the product to be stored for a long time. Once the jars have cooled, check if the vacuum has occurred correctly: you can press the center of the lid, and if you don't hear the classic "click-clack," the vacuum has occurred. Your prickly pear jam is ready to be enjoyed!
The prickly pear jam keeps for about 3 months, provided the vacuum has been done correctly and the jars are stored in a cool, dry place away from light and heat sources. It is recommended to wait at least 2-3 weeks before consuming the jam. Once each jar is opened, store in the refrigerator and consume within 3-4 days at most.
Before peeling the prickly pears, it is best to rinse them under cold water to neutralize the fine spines that cover the skin entirely. To determine if your jam is ready, there is a very simple method: dip a teaspoon in the mixture and drop a bit on a flat surface; if the mixture remains still when the surface is tilted, then the jam can be poured into the jars.
Homemade preparation of preserves and jams can pose health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the necessary conditions and measures to ensure the safety and suitability of foods, which, on the other hand, industrial procedures can guarantee to prevent dangerous contamination. Therefore, it is important to meticulously follow food safety instructions to reduce risks, but it should always be kept in mind that the same food safety as professionally produced preserves and jams cannot be achieved. For correct preparation of homemade preserves, refer to the Health Ministry guidelines .
