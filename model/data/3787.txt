Prepare the crepe batter by placing the eggs in a bowl and gradually adding the milk ; mix with a whisk, then add the flour and the butter that you have melted in a small saucepan. Stir until you get a smooth and homogeneous mixture, then add the salt and let it rest for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the béchamel (to see how to make it Béchamel sauce ). Heat a non-stick pan with a diameter of 6 inches and, using a ladle, place a little crepe batter in the center : with a rotational movement of the pan, or with the help of a spoon, spread the batter evenly over the entire bottom; cook for about 1 minute, then flip the crepe and cook on the other side. Proceed in the same manner to make 8 crepes .
Take each crepe, spread it with a layer of béchamel , place some spinach in the center , a few cubes of ham, and the julienned Gruyère cheese ; close the crepe in a cannoli shape and secure the ends with a toothpick. Fill all the crepes in the same way, then place them in a baking dish (or in 4 individual plates), sprinkle with a few pats of butter, and bake at 392°F for about 15 minutes. After the necessary time, remove the crepes from the oven and serve two per person.
If you do not want to use a traditional oven, you can heat the crepes in the microwave at maximum power for 1-2 minutes, just enough time for the cheese to melt.
