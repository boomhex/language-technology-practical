Add the eggs to the pan and stir to break the yolks . Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally .
Season with salt and pepper . Finally, add the grated parmesan cheese and stir for a few minutes. Plate and finish with freshly chopped parsley. The scrambled eggs with tomato are ready to be enjoyed .
Scrambled eggs with tomato should be consumed immediately after preparation, but if leftovers remain, you can store them in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for up to 1 day.
For a stringy touch, add mozzarella cubes when the eggs are almost ready. For a richer dish, you can add diced cooked ham or pancetta, previously browned. For those who love spicy food, add fresh chili pepper, sliced, to the onion sauté.
