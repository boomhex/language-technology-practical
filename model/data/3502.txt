To prepare the Italy cake, start with the preparation of the classic sponge cake. Using a hand mixer, a food processor, or a stand mixer, beat the eggs with the sugar for a long time, then add the sifted flour and potato starch. To see detailed preparation steps Sponge cake . Butter and flour a rectangular mold measuring 8 by 10 inches and pour the batter inside ; bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 30-35 minutes. The sponge cake will be ready when it detaches from the edges and when a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out completely dry. Once the sponge cake is cooked, let it cool and remove it from the mold. Cut the sponge cake in half using a long-bladed knife (2-3).
In a saucepan, dissolve the sugar in water to form a syrup , and when it reaches a boil, let it cook for 2-3 minutes, then turn off the heat and add the alchermes (or your preferred aroma) . Let the syrup cool and then moisten the two halves of the cake on the cut side ;
Prepare the custard (to see how to do it Pastry cream ), by flavoring the milk that you have heated in a saucepan along with the cream with the grated zest of an organic lemon; when the milk comes to a boil, strain it and proceed normally with the preparation of the classic custard. Let it cool by placing it in the refrigerator in a container covered with cling film that should be in contact with the cream itself (this is to avoid forming the classic hard skin on the surface). Once cold, spread it on one half of the cake , keeping a spoonful aside. Smooth it out well and cover the custard with the other half of the cake. With the spoonful of lemon custard kept aside, even out the sides where there might be areas without cream .
Prepare the chantilly cream by whipping the cream with the powdered sugar ( Chantilly cream to see how to do it) . Using a smooth-bladed knife, spread the chantilly cream over the entire surface of the cake, including the edges , making sure to spread it evenly on the top .
Then, place the remaining chantilly cream inside a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle and begin decorating the cake by making vertical piped lines on the sides ; complete with blobs of chantilly cream on top of the piped lines along the entire perimeter of the cake. Then proceed with the fruit decoration, clean and peel the kiwis, and slice them into pieces about 1/8 inch thick .
Wash the raspberries and dry them gently, then place them on top of the cake, arranging them in 4 rows of 8. Place the raspberries one by one very regularly . Once the red band is obtained, decorate with chantilly cream tufts to form the white central part of the flag. Complete by placing the kiwi slices . There you go: your Italy cake is ready to be enjoyed not just with your palate but also with your eyes! Place the cake in the refrigerator for at least one hour before enjoying it and...
