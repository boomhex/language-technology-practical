So, here's the thing: Sformato di maltagliati is like the ultimate baked pasta recipe that really, really captures what Emilia Romagna does best. This region? They're all about those rich, creamy flavors and pasta crafted with genuine care, and you'll totally taste that in every bite of this amazing Italian baked pasta . The maltagliati—those rustic, uneven pasta pieces—grab all the good stuff. You get tender sautéed veggies, a velvety béchamel sauce, and a gentle white ragù packed with meaty goodness. It’s all layered up, giving each forkful a moist, comforting vibe. And look, right before baking, there’s a nice sprinkle of grated cheese—really melts into a golden top that's so inviting. This isn’t your everyday quick meal; it's more of a special-occasion dish, perfect for bringing people together or for when you want something a bit different that even kids find exciting.
Here's the deal: Unlike many other pasta al forno dishes, this one focuses on the mix of flavors and those layered textures that Emilia Romagna is famous for. The white ragù is lighter than your typical red sauce, so the whole thing feels a little more delicate—but still loaded with taste, thanks to the cheese and veggies. People usually serve sformato di maltagliati in cute little ceramic cocottes, which is super charming and keeps it warm. Every spoonful? Gives you a bit of everything: the crispy cheese top, the soft pasta, and the creamy sauce, all working in harmony. Whether you call it a pasta casserole , a homemade pasta bake , or just your new favorite cheesy dinner, it's a traditional Italian dish that makes you slow down and really enjoy every bite.
Honestly, there's something comforting about how all the flavors blend together, making it a go-to for special meals or whenever you crave a hearty and satisfying oven-baked pasta. It’s really a celebration of Emilia Romagna’s culinary art, giving you a taste of Italy with every delicious bite. And you know what? You can't go wrong with that.
To prepare the maltagliati pie, start by making the fresh egg pasta: place the flour in a bowl, create a well in the center and pour the egg into it. Then begin working the ingredients with your hands directly in the bowl (1-2); keep some warm water on hand to add if necessary to make the egg pasta softer and of the ideal consistency for rolling it out with a rolling pin. Finish kneading on a work surface to obtain a smooth and homogeneous consistency; form a ball and place it in the bowl wrapped with plastic wrap: the dough should rest for at least 30 minutes in a cool place, away from drafts.
While the dough rests, prepare the Vegetable broth , then focus on the ragù by finely chopping the onion, celery, and carrots . In a pot with some oil, add the vegetables and sauté briefly for a few minutes , adding a little vegetable broth to aid cooking. Add the ground meat and brown for a few minutes.
Deglaze with white wine , add the chopped rosemary , salt, and pepper to taste, and finally the bay leaves. Gradually add the vegetable broth to aid the meat's cooking and cook on low heat for about 30 minutes. Once cooked, set the ragù aside.
Start preparing the vegetables. Finely chop the zucchini and carrots, while chopping the cherry tomatoes into wedges . In a pot with some oil, add the carrots .
Then add the zucchini ; sauté for a few minutes and add the cherry tomatoes, salt, and pepper to taste; cook for about ten minutes. Set the vegetables aside and proceed with preparing the béchamel. To prepare the Béchamel sauce , heat the milk (the milk must be very fresh and whole) in a saucepan and flavor it with grated nutmeg; separately, melt the butter over low heat, then turn off the heat and add the sifted flour, stirring with a whisk to avoid lumps . Then put it back on low heat and stir until it turns golden, obtaining the roux.
Gradually add the hot milk to the roux , stirring the mixture energetically with the whisk . Cook for 5-6 minutes over low heat until the sauce thickens and starts to boil. Turn off the heat and set the béchamel aside .
Now start preparing the maltagliati. Take the egg pasta that you left to rest and divide it into two portions; while you roll out the first one, keep the other wrapped in plastic wrap. Roll out with the rolling pin a sheet not too thin, 1/16 - 1/12 inch will be sufficient . Then cut strips and cut the pasta into diamonds or any shape . Place the maltagliati one by one on a lightly floured tray and flour the maltagliati as well. Then roll out the other portion and repeat the same operations.
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the maltagliati in batches for a few minutes . Then, drain the maltagliati with a slotted spoon , place them in a bowl
and drizzle them with a little oil . For assembling the pies, take a ramekin (2.75 inches in height and 3.5 inches in diameter) and layer the pie, starting with a tablespoon of béchamel and a layer of maltagliati .
Add another tablespoon of béchamel, a layer of vegetables , and finally the ragù . Continue alternating the ingredients to create more layers ;
Finish with a teaspoon of grated cheese . Once the maltagliati pies are ready , place them on a baking tray in the oven under the grill to gratinate (or at 428°F) for 5 minutes. Then take them out of the oven and let them cool slightly, then serve them !
It is recommended to consume the maltagliati pie immediately. You can freeze it if you have used all fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
You can vary the seasoning of the maltagliati by choosing your preferred vegetables or replacing the ground meat with sausage.
