To make the pina colada cupcakes, peel the fresh pineapple and cut 170 grams (6 oz) into small cubes , place the softened butter and sugar in a bowl , and beat them with an electric mixer to obtain a cream
then add the eggs and when they are well incorporated into the mixture, pour in the rum flavoring , mix with a spatula, and also add the sifted flour and baking powder.
Mix until the powders are well blended and finally add the fresh pineapple cubes . Transfer the mixture into a piping bag without a nozzle , then place paper cupcake liners in a 12-cupcake pan.
Distribute the obtained mixture into the 12 liners , filling them halfway so they will reach the liners' edge when baked. Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F (or 320°F fan-forced) for 20 minutes, or 10-15 minutes later. Meanwhile, prepare the cream: place the gelatin sheets in a bowl with cold water for 10 minutes to soften them , pour the coconut milk into a saucepan and heat it over moderate heat, then turn off the heat and incorporate the drained and well-squeezed gelatin ,
stir with a whisk to dissolve the gelatin . Transfer the coconut milk to a bowl , cover with plastic wrap in contact with the surface, and let the cream set in the refrigerator for 1 hour. After this time, whip the fresh liquid cream with powdered sugar
and add it to the coconut milk , mix with a spatula to combine, cover the cream with plastic wrap , and let it set again in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. After the resting time, take the now-cooled cupcakes , remove them from the multiple mold while keeping the paper liners.
Create the decorations: cut the coconut into wedges and the pineapple slices into triangles . Transfer the coconut cream into a piping bag with a star nozzle
and squeeze a tuft on each cupcake , garnish with the pineapple pieces , a cherry drained from the preserving liquid, coconut slices (or desiccated coconut), and mint leaves . Your pina colada cupcakes are ready!
Store the pina colada cupcakes in the refrigerator for up to a couple of days. You can store the unfrosted cupcakes under a glass dome for 2 days or freeze them.
If you can't find fresh pineapple, you can use canned pineapple. As an alternative to rum flavoring, you can use a teaspoon of rum liqueur.
