Prepare 2 cups of vegetable broth. Meanwhile, cut the lamb meat into pieces, remove all the fat you can, wash it, and dry it . Chop an onion and let it soften in a pan with 3 tablespoons of oil; then add the peas and the artichoke hearts cut into quarters to see how to clean artichokes, watch the video How to clean artichokes , and let them cook over moderate heat until they become tender but not mushy, adding broth as needed. Finally, adjust with salt.
Then chop the other onion and let it soften over low heat in another pan with another 3 tablespoons of oil, and then add the lamb pieces . Just let the meat whiten (not brown), then adjust with salt and immediately add the glass of red wine, allowing the lamb to cook over moderate heat, covered with a lid for about 20 minutes, until the cooking liquid thickens .
Preheat the oven to about 390°F, take a baking dish large enough to hold all the ingredients and arrange the lamb with its cooking sauce first, then the artichokes and peas . In a separate bowl, crumble the bread crumbs that will be used to cover the lamb and other ingredients in the baking dish: also add grated breadcrumbs, Parmesan, and Pecorino cheese, chopped parsley, pepper, and crushed garlic. Mix the ingredients well and entirely cover the baking dish ; moisten with the remaining broth (about 1 1/4 cups) and place the baking dish on the stove, covered with a lid, for 10 minutes, just enough time for the cooking steam to moisten and soften the crumbs. At this point, you can bake the lamb and let it gratinate for about 20 minutes, until a golden and crispy crust forms . Serve your gratinated lamb with artichokes and peas piping hot and enjoy your meal!
To best cook this dish, you should remove all the fat from the lamb meat, ensuring that the strong smell of the animal is eliminated and that the meat is not indigestible. Also, the lamb, added to the softened onion, should not brown but just cook long enough to turn white, after which you must immediately add the red wine to the preparation.
Since lamb is a very young animal (it is called so until one year of age), with always tender meats, there is no fixed rule for the ideal cooking of each piece, which can be braised, boiled, or roasted. Usually, for roasts, 15-20 minutes are calculated for every 1.1 lbs of meat, baking at 430°F, while boiled or braised dishes will require slightly longer cooking times.
