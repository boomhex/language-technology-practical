To prepare the artichoke pâté, start by cleaning them by removing the outer leaves . Once you reach the heart, cut off the tip and remove the outer layer of the stem .
Cut the artichokes into quarters (4-5), remove the choke in the center
and gradually immerse them in water along with the juice of two squeezed lemons . When you have finished cleaning the artichokes, transfer everything to a saucepan and cook for about 20 minutes .
Drain the artichokes , remove the lemons, and let them cool. Pour the artichokes into a blender , add the oil ,
the chopped parsley , and salt . Blend well
until you obtain a smooth consistency . Transfer your pâté into a bowl , place it in the refrigerator, covered with cling film in contact, and let it rest for about 20 minutes, so it becomes more compact. Serve it on bread crostini !
Store your pâté in a jar with an airtight seal for 3-4 days, pouring a thin layer of extra virgin olive oil on top to prevent oxidation. It is not recommended to freeze the pâté as it might release too much water during thawing.
Add fresh chili and ginger to make your pâté even fresher and more distinctive!
