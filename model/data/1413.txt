To make the flatbread with salmon and yogurt sauce, first, take the lemon peel with a peeler , cut the peels into thin strips . Now pour the sugar and water into a small saucepan and place it on the stove.
When the sugar has dissolved, add the lemon peel and cook over medium heat for 4 minutes until the water has evaporated and the peels are caramelized . Use kitchen tongs to place the peels on a tray lined with parchment paper .
In a tall glass, pour the yogurt , dill, and oil , blend with an immersion blender to obtain a smooth cream.

Place the salmon slices and sauce on top , add more arugula and caramelized lemon zest . The flatbread with salmon and yogurt sauce is ready to be served .
We recommend consuming the flatbread with salmon and yogurt sauce immediately.
With the leftover lemon, flavor some water with a few mint leaves to create a fresh and refreshing drink, perfect for accompanying the flatbread!
