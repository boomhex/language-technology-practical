Bicchierino bicolore is a layered dessert that'll make you want to savor every bite. Seriously, it's that good. This treat, straight outta Northern Italy, is served in a glass with two beautiful layers. You’ve got a creamy milk-based layer, and then there’s this lush amarena cherry cream that’s both tangy and sweet. Amarena cherries are like the hidden gem of Northern Italian desserts—really, you can’t miss them. Some are blended smooth, while others stay whole. Perfect little bursts.
And you know what sets this apart from your everyday puddings or chocolate mousse ? The almond crumble. It’s not just about looks—there’s this subtle crunch with a lightly savory note that works perfectly with the moist creaminess. I mean, each spoonful’s a surprise. Ever had something that’s both fancy and comforting at the same time? It’s like magic.
In Italy, it’s the go-to no-bake dessert for anyone craving something special without oven hassles. You get all the classic easy dessert recipe vibes, but with flavors like you’d find in a top-notch restaurant. For real. The way those layers blend? That’s what spoon desserts are all about in this region. Every bite brings smooth cream, tender cherries, and crispy almond bits. A whole experience.
So here's the thing: think of it as a close cousin to vanilla pudding or those whipped cream-topped delights, but with that cool Italian twist. The texture contrast and flavor blend make it an awesome finish for a meal with friends or family. Isn’t it just wonderful when dessert feels both fresh and a bit luxurious? Bicchierino bicolore totally nails that balance every single time. It’s a must-try for anyone who loves mixing elegance and comfort in their sweets. Really really awesome.
To prepare the two-tone glass, start with the milk cream: slice a vanilla bean lengthwise , then scrape out the seeds and add them to a saucepan with the milk. Turn on medium heat and bring to a boil. Add the sugar
and the cornstarch , whisk to prevent lumps, finally add the honey and cook everything over low heat, whisking to avoid lumps. The cream will be ready when it starts to thicken. Once ready, transfer it to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap; let it cool first at room temperature, then place it in the refrigerator.
While the cream cools, focus on the almond crumble: in a mixer, place the sifted all-purpose flour and almond flour , the cold butter from the fridge , and a pinch of salt .
Pulse to obtain a sandy mixture to spread on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Bake the crumble in a preheated static oven at 340°F for about 20 minutes (300°F for about 10 minutes if using a convection oven). Once baked, remove and let it cool completely .
While the crumble cools, divide the now cold cream equally into two small bowls . Add the cherries to one and blend everything until smooth.
Then whip the fresh cream using an electric mixer , and add half to the white milk cream and half to the cherry cream . Stir gently from top to bottom, folding the cream into the mixtures to prevent deflation. Place the creams into two separate piping bags. Take 4 small glasses of 5 oz each and start filling them beginning with the cherry cream
Continue with the almond crumble, and a teaspoon of cherry syrup ; place 2 cherries cut in half on top of the crumble and proceed with a layer of white milk cream. Then keep filling the glass with the almond crumble
the syrup, and the cherry cream , going up to the edge of the glass. Finish your two-tone glasses by decorating with a dollop of white cream in the center and a cherry on top !
You can store the glasses in the fridge for 1-2 days, covered with plastic wrap.
The crumble can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for 1-2 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
