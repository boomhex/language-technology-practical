To make the mezze maniche with eggplants and Grana Padano wafers, first wash and dry the eggplants, then cut them first into thick slices and then into sticks, then reduce them to cubes of about 1 cm . Place a pan with seed oil on the stove and heat it to 338°F, fry the eggplants for a couple of minutes or until they are golden, then drain them with a slotted spoon .
Place the fried eggplants on a tray lined with absorbent paper to dry the excess oil . Meanwhile, place a pot filled with water on the stove and bring to a boil, it will be used for cooking the pasta. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and distribute 2 oz of grated Grana Padano PDO with a teaspoon to create an even layer .
Season with ground pepper and bake in a preheated fan oven at 338°F for 10 minutes. In the meantime, cook the pasta for the time indicated on the package .
Take your Grana Padano PDO wafer out of the oven and let it cool slightly. As soon as the pasta is ready, drain it into a large bowl and season it with olive oil .
Flavor with fresh basil leaves , well-drained sun-dried tomatoes in oil , and olives .
Incorporate the fried eggplants and flavor with a tablespoon of grated Grana Padano PDO . Take the wafer and break it to obtain coarse pieces . Garnish the pasta with the Grana Padano PDO flakes and enjoy it lukewarm .
We recommend consuming the pasta with eggplants and Grana Padano wafers lukewarm. Freezing is not recommended.
For a lighter version, you can grill the eggplants and then cut them into pieces to add to the pasta instead of frying them!
