instructions:
To prepare the buffalo finger bites, start by cleaning the red shrimp: detach the head , the legs , and the shell, including the tail .
Make an incision along the back with a small knife and remove the intestine, which is the black string . Once the shrimp are cleaned , chop them with a knife without over-chopping .
Place them in a bowl and dress with olive oil , salt, and pepper. Wash and dry the basil, cut it into thin strips, and add it to the bowl, stirring to season. Now drain the buffalo bites from their preserving water, cut them in half , and gently pat them dry with a kitchen towel .
Grate the lemon zest and collect it in a small bowl . Everything is ready to assemble the buffalo and shrimp finger bites: take an appetizer spoon and place a buffalo bite on top , then add the shrimp on top .
Then fragrance with the lemon zest (13-14) and immediately serve the buffalo finger bites on a tray .
Buffalo finger bites should be consumed immediately and cannot be frozen.
Don't throw away the shrimp cleaning scraps but use them to make a flavorful broth, perfect for making a tasty fish risotto!
Before consuming raw, marinated, or not perfectly cooked fish, it is recommended to freeze for at least 96 hours at -0.4 degrees Fahrenheit in a domestic freezer marked with 3 or more stars, following the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
