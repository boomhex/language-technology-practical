Tagliolini pizza is this super tasty Campanian classic. Seriously good stuff. It's often enjoyed during Easter in southern Italy, and it's got a pretty cool backstory. Originally, it was created as a way—pretty genius—to use up leftovers. It’s like the ultimate "clean out the fridge" meal, but way way better in terms of flavor. What makes this tagliolini pizza stand out is the use of uncooked tagliolini pasta. And look, it gets mixed directly with eggs, chunks of Neapolitan salami , and cubes of provolone cheese before baking.
There's no need to pre-boil the pasta because, honestly, the thin noodles soak up the egg and cheese mixture perfectly as it bakes. They come out tender yet never, and I mean never, soggy. Every slice is packed with savory bites of salami and cheese. And the top? Super crispy and golden in the oven. Campanian families often dig into it warm, but it’s just as tasty at room temperature. For sure. It's perfect for picnics or outdoor gatherings, especially on Pasquetta—the Monday after Easter dedicated to just relaxing and eating outside.
Unlike your typical pizza, this pasta pizza recipe isn’t about tomato sauce and mozzarella. It’s more like a cross between a frittata and a baked pie, with pasta as the star. People love to get creative with the fillings—whatever they have on hand, like different types of salumi or chunks of ham. Which is great. It’s one of those traditional Italian recipes that lets you play around while keeping the core of the dish intact.
In Naples, they might call it a Neapolitan tagliolini pie , but whatever the name, every slice is hearty, a bit moist, and totally satisfying. It is a dish that brings everyone together around the table, especially during the holidays. And truthfully, though it began as a peasant dish, the result is a baked pasta pizza with a rich flavor and a tender texture that feels special for any occasion. Bring a homemade Italian pasta pie to your next gathering, and you’ll see how fast it disappears. Nobody can resist that savory aroma or the first bite of those crispy pasta edges.
