instructions:
To prepare the Tuscan pici, pour the flour on a pastry board and create the classic well shape. First, pour the water and start mixing with a fork . Then add the oil .
Knead for about 6-7 minutes , until you have a homogeneous mixture . Wrap in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, take a portion of the dough and flatten it first with your hands .
Roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 0.4 inches and then cut it into strips about 0.4 inches wide . Now form the pici: roll each strip individually on the work surface to form large, long spaghetti .
Place them gradually on a tray with a well-floured cloth to prevent them from sticking together . Now move on to the sauce. Slice both the chili and the garlic cloves .
Pour some extra virgin olive oil into a non-stick pan , then add the garlic cloves and the chili . Let it cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes so the garlic cooks gently. When it's soft, mash it .
Add the tomato pulp and salt . Let it cook for another 15 minutes .
Cook the pici in abundant salted water for about 6-7 minutes, then drain them and add them to the sauce . Mix the pici well, tossing them , and serve them .
If you wish to freeze the pici, first let them harden in the freezer on a floured tray, then transfer them to bags, being careful not to break them. Seasoned Tuscan pici can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day.
" Fonte Giusta " is a trattoria located in the historical heart of Siena, where the choice of raw materials and genuineness are what guests, both Italian and foreign, can still count on. Homemade bread, hand-rolled fresh pasta, sauces, and traditional Sienese recipes, as well as dishes that change with the seasons, make Fonte Giusta "a haven for the romantics of the table," as chef Giuseppe Chiarelli, also known as Chef Pino, likes to call it.
