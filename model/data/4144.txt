Sun-dried tomato pesto is a very flavorful condiment, ideal for preparing a boldly flavored main course. The sun-dried tomatoes, which are the key ingredient in this recipe, are a very popular preserve in southern Italy, particularly in Calabria, Apulia, and Sicily. In these regions, at the end of summer, tomatoes are dried in the sun and then preserved in oil, where they develop a tangy and slightly spicy flavor. By adding pine nuts, blanched almonds, and basil to the tomatoes soaked in their preserving oil and blending everything, you get this pesto, which remains quite concentrated in both form and flavor. With sun-dried tomato pesto, you will give a Mediterranean touch and an intense flavor to your dishes, here are some delicious ideas:
To prepare the sun-dried tomato pesto, pour the sun-dried tomatoes into the blender with the oil in which they are preserved , add the pine nuts , and the blanched almonds .
Add the basil leaves and blend until you get a rather coarse mixture . At this point, your sun-dried tomato pesto is ready to be used as a flavorful condiment !
Sun-dried tomato pesto keeps in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 3 days. Before storing it in the fridge, drizzle some oil on top. It can be frozen. Defrost it in the refrigerator when needed.
Salt is not used in the sun-dried tomato pesto because the sun-dried tomatoes are already preserved in oil and salt and give a tangy note to the pesto. If you prefer, you can add 0.7 oz of desalted capers or some fresh chili pepper, in case the tomatoes are not flavorful enough. To obtain a milder pesto, double the amount of fresh basil.
