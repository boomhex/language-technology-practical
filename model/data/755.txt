To prepare the broccoli balls in the air fryer, first, separate the florets from the stem . The stem will be used to immediately prepare the sauce for your balls, like this: remove the base of the stem, then separate all the small branches .
Cut them into pieces. Peel the stem to remove the outer, tougher part. Then cut the core of the stem into pieces as well . Parboil everything in salted boiling water to taste for about 5 minutes. When they are soft, drain them using a slotted spoon and transfer them to a blender jar . Do not discard the water, it will be needed for cooking the florets.
Add salt, pepper , a drizzle of oil , and some marjoram leaves .
Pour in a ladle of the cooking water and blend with an immersion blender until you get a smooth sauce . Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.
Bring the water where you cooked the stems back to a boil and immerse the florets as well . Cook for about 4-5 minutes, then drain them . Transfer them to a blender jar and add a small piece of garlic (about 1/3 of a clove) .
Add the anchovies and blend everything with an immersion blender until you get a smooth cream . Transfer the mixture to a bowl and add an egg .
Add the grated Grana Padano PDO , breadcrumbs , salt, pepper, and ricotta .
Mix until you get a homogeneous mixture , then use your hands to form balls about 8 inches , and gradually place them on a tray lined with parchment paper .
Pour oil into one baking dish and breadcrumbs into another. Now bread the balls by first dipping them in the oil and then in the breadcrumbs . Gradually place them on a tray lined with parchment paper .
Proceed to cooking (we used a fryer with a capacity of 6 liters). Preheat the fryer for a minute, then place about 15 balls in the basket and cook them at 356°F for 15-20 minutes until they are well browned . Continue cooking the others and serve the balls with the sauce prepared earlier !
The cooked balls and sauce can be stored for 2 days in the refrigerator, in separate airtight containers.
You can freeze both the raw balls and the sauce.
For cooking the balls, adjust based on the size of your fryer basket. If it is smaller than ours, cook them in 3 batches; if it is larger, you can cook them all at once. Make sure the balls do not overlap and are slightly spaced apart.
You can season the balls with paprika, parsley, or other herbs and spices.
For a vegetarian version, just remove the anchovies.
For a stronger taste, replace the Grana with Pecorino or do half and half.
