instructions:
To make the cardoon soup, start by preparing the broth following our Beef Broth recipe. Now take care of cleaning the cardoons: remove the outer leaves , trim the ends, and use a vegetable peeler to remove the strings . Cut the stalks into pieces about 2 inches , you should get about 1.5 lbs,
fill a bowl with water and squeeze lemon juice into it. As you cut the cardoon stalks, immerse the pieces in the acidulated water to prevent them from turning brown . Now, in a pot, bring salted water to a boil, immerse the cardoons drained from the soaking water and blanch them for a couple of minutes, leaving them al dente. In a pan, melt the butter with the olive oil ;
once the cardoons are blanched, drain them using a slotted spoon directly into the pan where you melted the butter with the oil , season with salt and pepper and sauté the cardoons in the pan for 5 minutes. Now transfer the cardoons to another pot
add the meat broth and cook for another 5 minutes . Take 4 cocottes to serve the cardoon soup, and in each one, pour a whole egg, beat the eggs with a fork ,
season with grated cheese and add the drained cardoons , finish the dishes by pouring the hot broth . Your cardoon soup is ready to be enjoyed hot!
Cardoon soup is a dish to be consumed immediately. We do not recommend storing or freezing it after cooking.
To make the cardoon soup even more appetizing, accompany it with toasted bread croutons.
