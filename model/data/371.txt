Stewed rabbit with olives and sun-dried tomatoes is this classic dish from Southern Italy that really hits the spot when you're craving something hearty and packed with tender flavor. I mean, it’s seriously good. This stewed rabbit recipe uses a slow-cooking style—pretty much magic—that brings out the best in the meat. After simmering for a while, the rabbit gets so moist it almost falls off the bone. Really, it’s that good.
And here's the thing: what sets this apart from a regular stew is the Sicilian or Calabrian olives, plus those chewy, sweet sun-dried tomatoes. Folks down south love to splash in a bit of Marsala wine, which gives the sauce this rich taste that lingers. It's the kind of rustic rabbit dish meant for a big table, with everyone grabbing seconds and mopping up sauce with crusty bread.

On Sundays, you'll find families in places like Puglia or Sicily around a pot of this, letting the aromatic smells fill the house as it simmers low and slow. Honestly, it’s all about the simple things—good company, a glass of wine, and food that makes you feel at home. And the sauce? Super tasty.
The combination of briny olives, tangy tomatoes, and that golden sauce from slow-cooking is what makes this dish different from any other Italian rabbit stew . Some folks even toss in a few garden herbs to boost the taste. This rabbit stew with sun-dried tomatoes really sums up what home-style southern Italian cooking is all about: taking your time, enjoying every bite, and using ingredients that remind you of family traditions. It’s a meal that sticks with you—not just because it’s filling—but because it feels like something special every time it’s on the table. Imagine a sunny afternoon, the warm breeze carrying the scent of herbs, making each moment feel like a celebration of life and good food. For real.
