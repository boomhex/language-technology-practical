instructions:
To prepare chicken and vegetable spring rolls, first trim the zucchini and cut them into chunks , then peel the carrots and cut them in the same way .
Peel the ginger and place everything in a mixer . Blend to finely chop all the ingredients .
In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil, add the chopped vegetables , and sauté for a few minutes. Adjust the salt , then add the ground chicken .
The filling should not cook but only dry out . Transfer it to a bowl, then pour in the soy sauce and mix thoroughly .
Place a rice paper sheet on the work surface, position some filling near the short side, and moisten the edges with water . Fold the long sides inward then roll the spring roll over itself . Repeat the process until all ingredients are used and set aside.
Now, focus on preparing the mayonnaise that will accompany your spring rolls. Combine the egg, vegetable oil , salt , and vinegar in a jug.
Add the mustard as well and blend for 30 seconds , just enough time to get your mayonnaise .
Take the spring rolls and fry them in vegetable oil at 350°F until golden . Drain and transfer to paper towels to remove excess oil . Your chicken and vegetable spring rolls are ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume chicken and vegetable spring rolls immediately; if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator for up to one day.
Do not overfill the rolls to facilitate closing and prevent them from opening during cooking.
You can vary the filling according to your tastes: for example, it is possible to replace the chicken with shrimp or crab meat, or you can flavor it with spices such as curry, smoked paprika, or chili pepper.
You can also accompany the chicken and vegetable spring rolls with sweet and sour sauce!
