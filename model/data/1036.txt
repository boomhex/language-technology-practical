To prepare the kiwi and salmon maki, first wash the rice: place the rice in a large bowl and rinse it under cold running water, moving the rice with your hands. Do at least 5-6 rinses until the water is clear. Put the rice in a saucepan and add water until it is about an inch above the rice .
Cook with the lid for about 12 minutes or until the water is completely absorbed. Check occasionally to make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan. Transfer the rice to a container and season it with sushi dressing, adjusting the amount to your taste . Stir with a spoon to flavor .
Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let it rest for 1 hour at room temperature. After the resting time, cut the salmon into sticks 0.2 inches thick . Peel the kiwi
cut it in half lengthwise and also reduce it to sticks of the same thickness as the salmon . Place the nori seaweed on a sushi mat . Distribute the rice on the seaweed with wet hands, so the rice doesn't stick to your fingers, leaving about 1 inch free at the top of the seaweed .
Place the salmon and kiwi sticks just below the middle of the rice, covering the entire length of the seaweed horizontally. Now take the bottom edge of the mat and, pressing with your fingers inward, roll everything up like a roll . Apply gentle pressure on the roll to compact it, roll until you see the strip of seaweed not covered with rice; then move the roll slightly forward so that the uncovered strip of nori seaweed seals the roll.
The roll is ready, cut it in half with a knife with a moistened blade , then cut each piece into 3 equal parts to obtain single maki pieces. Serve the kiwi and salmon maki immediately .
We recommend consuming the kiwi and salmon maki immediately.
The sushi dressing can be purchased ready-made or can be made at home with 200 ml of rice vinegar, 90 g of sugar, and 30 g of fine salt.
Before consuming raw, marinated, or not perfectly cooked fish, it is recommended to freeze it for at least 96 hours at -0.4 degrees Fahrenheit in a home freezer marked with 3 or more stars, as per the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
