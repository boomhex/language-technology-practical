instructions:
To prepare the filet mignon medallions with balsamic, start by cutting 4 medallions from the beef, each about 7 oz . Wrap each with 2 slices of bacon and tie them with kitchen twine to maintain their shape .
Insert a few sprigs of rosemary to flavor the meat ; then in a large pan, pour a drizzle of oil and add the butter to melt it over low heat. Then place the beef medallions to sear them over high heat for 3-5 minutes depending on the desired level of doneness (it's better not to cook them too long to avoid them becoming dry).
Halfway through cooking, flip the medallions to sear them on the other side as well. Once ready, remove them from the pan and use the same cooking base to make the sauce: pour the balsamic vinegar into the pan , add the crushed juniper berries
also add the cloves and the cinnamon stick . Let the sauce cook and reduce, season with salt to taste , and then turn off the heat.
Strain the balsamic sauce to remove the spice residues and drizzle it over the filet mignon medallions (14-15). You can serve the remaining balsamic sauce separately in a small jug!
It is preferable to consume the filet mignon medallions as soon as they are cooked. The balsamic sauce can be stored covered with plastic wrap for 1-2 days in a cool place. Freezing is not recommended.
You can wrap the medallions with slices of speck if you do not like bacon! As for cooking, it's better not to overdo it, but if you don't prefer rare meat, keep it on the heat a few more minutes and make sure it's cooked by piercing it and checking that the color of the liquid that comes out is clear!
