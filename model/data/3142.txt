instructions:
To prepare the gastronomic panettone cake, cut the savory panettone into slices about 1.2 inches thick , thus obtaining 6 slices. Butter a 20 cm (8-inch) springform pan, dip a first slice of panettone in milk and place it on the bottom of the pan applying light pressure .
Dip and place a second slice, applying light pressure to completely cover the bottom . Distribute the slices of cooked ham , the ricotta cheese ,
some rosemary needles and the oil , adjust with pepper and cover this layer with two more slices of soaked panettone, always ensuring they are evenly arranged. Then, creating the second layer, place the bresaola , add the chèvre (French goat cheese) ,
the oil, rosemary, and some pepper (10-11). Finish with the last layer: soak two more slices of panettone in milk
and place them inside the springform pan , sprinkle the surface with Parmesan cheese , rosemary, a drizzle of oil , and pepper.
Once finished , bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 25-30 minutes. Remove from the oven , then unmold your gastronomic panettone cake and serve in slices .
Store in the refrigerator for 3-4 days and reheat as needed.
Since this is a post-Christmas "leftover" recipe, you can add any ingredient you have left: little pieces of sausage, coppa, sautéed spinach, radicchio, and any kind of cheese!
