instructions:
To prepare the apple crumble cake, start with the dough. In a bowl, place the butter together with the sugar . Soften it with a wooden spoon until creamy . Add the egg and mix until well absorbed.
Incorporate the all-purpose flour, previously sifted , and the baking powder, also sifted . Mix with your fingertips until you get a crumbly mixture.
At this point, add the walnuts and give a quick mix , until the ingredients are combined . Set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Prepare the apple and amaretti filling. Peel the apples, cut them in half, remove the core, and then cut them into quarters . From these, cut into cubes about 0.4 inches (1 cm) large . Transfer the apple cubes to a bowl and add the lemon zest .
Add the juice , the sugar , and mix .
Coarsely crumble the amaretti with your hands and add them to the apples . Mix well .
Butter and flour a 8-inch springform pan. Place three-quarters of the dough on the bottom of the pan, pressing with your hands to cover the entire bottom and raise the edges to contain the filling . Pour in the apples with the amaretti , level, and cover with the remaining crumbled dough .
Try to completely cover the apples, without pressing this time . Bake the apple crumble cake in a preheated static oven at 356°F (180°C) for about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely before removing from the mold and serving.
The apple crumble cake with walnuts and amaretti can be stored at room temperature for 2-3 days covered with cling film or under a cake dome; freezing is not recommended.
You can replace the walnuts with hazelnuts or almonds. You can add 4 oz (120 g) of orange or apricot marmalade to the filling.
