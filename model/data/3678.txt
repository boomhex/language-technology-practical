instructions:
To prepare the pink scaloppine, the meat must be of excellent quality and very tender. First, take a cutting board, lay the slices on it and then flatten them with a meat tenderizer , if the slices are very large cut them in half to obtain regular portions . Flour the slices on both sides . Meanwhile, heat the oil and butter in a non-stick pan.
When the oil is hot, place the scaloppine in the pan and let them brown on both sides for a couple of minutes, until they are golden brown (4-5). Add the wine and let it evaporate .
Meanwhile, dilute the tomato paste with some water or hot broth . When the wine has evaporated, add the tomato and season with salt and pepper, according to your taste. When the tomato is well blended, add a few tablespoons of milk to dilute the cooking base .
Then add the mascarpone which you have thinned with a bit of milk , pour the mascarpone into the pan and blend everything well , let it cook until the sauce thickens, then add the pink peppercorns . Serve the pink scaloppine covered with mascarpone sauce.
The pink scaloppine can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
For a better presentation, it is advisable to cut each slice into two parts, so as to obtain two small pieces of meat for each person, which you will drizzle with the mascarpone sauce.
