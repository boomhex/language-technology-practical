Culurgiones from Sardinia are one of those dishes that show just how creative Italian food can be. Really, it is something special. This culurgiones recipe blends old-school tradition with a twist—think beetroot pasta dough that adds a bright pop of color. The dough's deep shade comes from fresh beetroot—making every piece look almost too good to eat. Inside, there's a classic potato filling with boiled potatoes, tender pecorino cheese, and a hint of mint. It's straight from Ogliastra, the region known for these Sardinian dumplings. The mint adds a fresh kick while the potatoes and cheese keep things creamy and a little savory. And listen, unlike regular ravioli, culurgiones have a special pleated shape. Making them is almost like art—definitely a talking point at the table.
What sets this version apart is the bold blue cheese sauce drizzled over the top. And you know what? It's not just any sauce. It's a Roquefort fondue that offers a punchy, rich taste, balancing the sweet earthiness of beetroot and the moist potato center. Folks in Sardinia usually stick with a simple tomato or butter sauce, but swapping in this blue cheese dressing adds a gourmet touch that feels rustic yet fancy. Some folks play around with different shapes or fillings—maybe tossing in extra herbs, or using the beetroot dough for other pasta types—but this combo of beetroot and potato with sharp blue cheese? Tough to beat. Serve these homemade culurgiones at a dinner party, and you'll see how the colors, flavors, and creamy textures impress. For sure. It’s a fun way to take something traditional and give it a fresh look, all while keeping the real spirit of Sardinian dumplings alive. Add a sprinkle of pecorino cheese on top for extra flavor, and you’ve got a dish that’s not only tasty but also a real conversation starter. So... So good.

To prepare beetroot culurgiones with potatoes and blue cheese sauce, first, boil the potatoes starting with cold water; it will take about 30-40 minutes, depending on their size 1 . Meanwhile, prepare the dough: peel the pre-cooked beetroots and place them in a beaker 2 along with the water 3 .
Blend with an immersion blender to obtain a smooth and homogeneous puree 4 . Place the semolina on the work surface in a mound, then pour the beetroot puree into the center 5 and add a pinch of salt 6 .
Start incorporating the flour by mixing with a fork 7 , then continue with a dough scraper 8 , and finally knead the mixture by hand 9 .
Once you have obtained a smooth, elastic, and homogeneous dough 10 , wrap it in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to rest for at least 30 minutes. In the meantime, the potatoes will be cooked, so mash them in a bowl 11 . Cut the mint leaves into very thin strips 12 .
Add the mint to the mashed potatoes 13 along with a pinch of salt and the grated pecorino cheese 14 . Mix well to combine the mixture 15 and set aside.
Take the dough and divide it in half 16 , making sure to wrap the portion you are not using in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out. Slightly flatten the dough with your hands and start rolling it out with a pasta machine, beginning with the largest thickness 17 . Fold the sheet towards the center 18 and roll it out several times, gradually reducing the thickness.
Once you have obtained a sheet with a thickness of approximately 1/16 inch 19 , cut out discs with a 4-inch diameter cookie cutter 20 . You can re-knead the scraps and roll them out again after a brief rest. Place a ball of filling in the center of each disc 21 .
Fold the disc in half and pinch the edges starting from one end 22 to the other, sealing the filling inside 23 ; it's normal for a little filling to poke out at the end. As you form the culurgiones, place them on the work surface lightly dusted with semolina 24 and set them aside for a moment.
Finally, focus on the fondue: in a saucepan, combine the Roquefort cheese 25 and milk 26 , then turn on the heat to its lowest setting and stir with a whisk until the cheese is completely melted 27 .
You are ready for cooking: bring a pot of salted water to a boil, gently immerse the culurgiones 28 , and cook for 3-4 minutes. When they float to the surface, drain them and transfer them to a non-stick pan, then add a drizzle of olive oil 29 and a ladle of cooking water 30 . Briefly toss everything to finish off, and you're ready to plate.
Spread the Roquefort sauce on the base of the plate 31 , then place the culurgiones 32 and garnish with mint leaves. Your beetroot culurgiones with potatoes and blue cheese sauce 33 are ready!
It is recommended to consume the beetroot culurgiones with potatoes and blue cheese sauce immediately.
You can store the raw culurgiones in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Alternatively, you can freeze them and then cook them directly from frozen, extending the cooking time by a few minutes.
If you prefer, you can replace the Roquefort with Gorgonzola, either sweet or spicy.
When sealing the culurgiones, you can spray the edges with a little water to make them adhere better.
