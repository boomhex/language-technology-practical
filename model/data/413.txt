instructions:
To prepare pork loin in a pan, start by cleaning the champignon mushrooms. Cut off the earthy end of the stem, remove the skin covering the cap. Clean the mushrooms with a clean, damp cloth to remove any remaining dirt. In a pan, pour 1 tbsp of oil, taken from the total, add a clove of garlic with its skin and let it brown . Add the mushrooms and season with salt .
Add the pepper as well . Then cover the pan with a lid and cook on low heat for 5 minutes . Take the pork loin, remove the fat from the edges (if you like, you can leave it) and cut it into slices about 3/4 inch thick .
Coat both sides of the slices in flour and remove any excess .
In another pan, pour the remaining 1 tbsp of oil , place the pork loin slices , and brown them over high heat, 1 minute per side .
Deglaze with white wine and let the alcohol evaporate. Adjust with salt and continue cooking over low heat for 10 minutes. Then add the mushrooms with all their cooking juices .
Continue cooking on high heat for a few minutes , just enough time to flavor the pork loin slices .
Finally, add the chopped parsley . The pork loin in a pan is ready , serve it with its cooking juices.
Pork loin in a pan can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator in a closed container for one or two days.
It can be frozen and then thawed in the refrigerator before reheating in a pan.
You can use spices and herbs as you like.
You can replace champignons with any type of mushroom.
If you prefer a creamier and more delicate cooking juice, replace the white wine with the same amount of milk.
