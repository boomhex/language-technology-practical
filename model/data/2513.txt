To make the fried rolls with vegetables and prawns, start by washing the vegetables, then peel and trim the carrots, cut them first into sticks and then into cubes , trim the zucchini and cut them the same way , continue with the eggplants: trim them and cut them into small cubes .
Slice the chicken into rounds . Move on to the artichokes: cut off the spiny tip, peel the artichoke by removing the tougher outer leaves , continue until you reach the more tender ones, cut off the end of the stem and use a paring knife to remove the fibrous outer layer .
Now cut the artichoke in half and then slice it . In a pan, heat 2 tsp of olive oil, add the leek , let it soften for 5 minutes, then add the carrots and cook them for 2-3 minutes,
then add the eggplants and continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes, then incorporate the artichokes and let it go for another 2-3 minutes, finish with the zucchini
flavor with thyme , season with salt and pepper, and cook for 2 more minutes. Once everything is ready, turn off the heat and let it cool. Clean the prawns: remove the head, legs, and shell of the prawns (14-15) to gently extract the meat.
Cut the prawn tails in half by slicing the back , remove the intestine. In a large pan, pour a drizzle of oil, the peeled garlic clove, and sauté the prawns (17-18)
for a minute, then place the vegetables in a bowl and add the prawns , removing the garlic clove. Take the dough discs
place them on a cutting board, fill them with 2 teaspoons of filling, brush the edge of the disc with egg white and close the sides and roll it up
to give it the shape of a roll . Cook the rolls: in a large pot, heat the vegetable oil, when it reaches 340°F, fry 2-3 rolls at a time until they are golden. Drain the rolls and place them on a tray covered with paper towels to dry . Your fried rolls with vegetables and prawns are ready to be enjoyed hot.
It is preferable to consume the rolls as soon as they are made, and freezing is not recommended.
As an alternative to prawns, you can use shrimp; if you like a touch of freshness, flavor the filling with chopped mint leaves.
