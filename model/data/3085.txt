To prepare the aromatic steamed meatballs, start by chopping the herbs: chop the chives , parsley, thyme, marjoram, and fennel seeds with a knife and set aside. Take the stale bread, remove the crust , and cut the crumb into cubes,
place it in a food processor and finely chop it. Wash the green onion, cut the stem and set it aside (it will be used to flavor the cooking water), chop the bulb of the green onion , and stew it with a ladle of broth or water until it wilts.
Take a pot equipped with a steam cooking basket large enough and pour in the water, add the aromas: bay leaf, whole peppercorns, and the green onion stem you saved . Beat the eggs in a bowl , add salt and pepper. In another bowl, place the minced meat and season it with crushed garlic ,
the stewed green onion cooled down , the previously beaten eggs , and finally the crumb chopped with the mixer .
Knead everything until the mixture is smooth and compact . Now add all the previously chopped herbs: chives, parsley , thyme, marjoram ,
and fennel seeds . Now form the meatballs: try to make small meatballs more or less the same size (weighing about 0.7 oz each) to ensure even cooking. Skewer the meatballs with toothpicks , heat the water in the pot, and wait for it to boil.
Place the aromatic meatballs in the steamer and cook them for about 18 minutes covered with the lid . (If you want, you can also bake the meatballs: place the meatballs in a greased baking dish and bake in a static oven for 30 minutes at 350°F or in a convection oven at 320°F for about 25 minutes). Once cooked, serve the aromatic steamed meatballs hot; if you like, you can accompany them with a fresh lamb's lettuce salad .
Store the aromatic steamed meatballs in the refrigerator in an airtight container for no more than 2 days. You can freeze the meatballs only if you have used fresh ingredients.
Steam cooking is not only perfect for the line, but also to enhance the combined flavors in the meatballs' mixture: this is why it's important to balance them according to your taste. If you are a fan of strong flavors, add some grated Parmesan cheese; if you love spiciness, there's nothing better than a pinch of fresh chili pepper.
