Every now and then we can indulge in some fried food, like these savory zeppoline with salami and cheese! Bite-sized delights with an explosive flavor, perfect for an aperitif or a delicious appetizer. Unlike traditional raised dough fritters, like the Pettole , these are quick to make thanks to the use of instant yeast. The batter can then be flavored with cold cuts of your choice; we also chose to add Parmigiano Reggiano PDO and marjoram leaves. Serve the savory zeppoline with salami and cheese with a small bowl of mayonnaise and other tasty fried goodies:

To make the savory zeppoline with salami and cheese, first cut the salami into cubes . In a bowl, pour the flour and the yeast , then add the water slowly while stirring with a whisk .
When you have obtained a smooth and homogeneous mixture , add the salt , pepper, and marjoram leaves .
Also add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano PDO and the salami cubes and combine everything with a spatula .
Heat the vegetable oil until it reaches 340°F and use 2 tablespoons to form balls to drop into the hot oil (always be careful not to burn yourself and make sure all the tools you use are perfectly dry) . Fry a few pieces at a time for about 4-5 minutes until golden, turning them often. Once ready, drain and transfer to absorbent paper . Serve your savory zeppoline with salami and cheese hot!
It is recommended to consume the savory zeppoline with salami and cheese immediately.
If you wish, you can replace the salami with speck or diced prosciutto!
