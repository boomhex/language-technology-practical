instructions:
To prepare the pasta and breadcrumbs, cut a loaf of bread in half and take the soft part to put in the mixer to chop it finely .
Prepare the other ingredients as well: chop the bunch of parsley and mince the fresh chili pepper, removing the seeds inside . Then start toasting the breadcrumbs: in a large pan, heat 3 1/2 tbsps of olive oil over low heat and crush half a clove of garlic .
When the garlic is golden, add the breadcrumbs and stir with a wooden spatula to flavor it and ensure it doesn't burn: you should toast it over medium heat for about 5-8 minutes. Meanwhile, in another large pan, heat the remaining 3 1/2 tbsps of olive oil, add the chopped chili pepper and the other half of the peeled garlic clove .
Drain the anchovy fillets from their preserving oil and place them in the pan , then melt them over medium heat . Bring plenty of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti until al dente .
When ready, drain the spaghetti (reserve the cooking water) and transfer them to the pan with garlic, oil, chili, and anchovy fillets . Toss the pasta over high heat, add the toasted breadcrumbs and chopped parsley .
Mix and drizzle with a ladle of the spaghetti cooking water . The pasta and breadcrumbs are ready to be served very hot (17-18)!
For a touch of color, you can also add some cherry tomatoes or black or Taggiasca olives!
