instructions:
To prepare sautéed asparagus, start with the cleaning of the asparagus: wash them well, then break them with your hands to remove the lighter and tougher part of the stalk, keeping slightly below the point where the asparagus tends to bend . Use a peeler to peel the end of the asparagus . Gather them gradually in a bowl and proceed in this way for all the others .
In a pan, add a pat of butter and let it melt. Place the asparagus inside without overlapping them and brown them over medium-high heat for 4-5 minutes .
When they are golden, turn them , wait another 3-4 minutes, and deglaze with white wine . Let the alcohol evaporate and season with salt and pepper .
Cover with a lid and slightly lower the heat. Cook for about 20 minutes until they are tender , then serve your sautéed asparagus !
We recommend storing the sautéed asparagus for a maximum of 2 days in the refrigerator, closed in an airtight container.
If necessary, you can add a splash of water during cooking. If you prefer, you can flavor the asparagus by adding a clove of garlic to the butter.
