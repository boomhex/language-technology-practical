To prepare the quiche with scallops and leeks, start by cleaning the leeks. Remove the green part , then cut the surface with the blade of a small knife , remove the outer layer , and finally cut them into thin slices .
After melting half of the butter dose with a little oil in a non-stick pan, stew the leek slices over low heat for about 15 minutes until they are very tender . Once cooked, set the leeks aside and proceed to grate the Emmental cheese; set this aside as well .
At this point, you can prepare the scallops. Place them on a tray and cover them with a paper towel , gently pat them to remove excess water . Melt the remaining butter in the pan where you cooked the leeks and brown the scallops for a few minutes, turning them with a wooden spoon from time to time ; adjust the salt.
Once cooked, let the mollusks cool in a bowl and flavor them by adding some thyme . After coarsely chopping the scallops , set them aside. In a bowl, pour the four eggs and the yolk, salt, pepper, and fresh cream .
Now pour the leeks and the mollusks into the liquid mixture. Line a 11-inch diameter mold with parchment paper and unroll the pastry, making sure it adheres well to the bottom .
Pierce the pastry with the tines of a fork . You can now fill the pastry: distribute the grated Emmental cheese on the bottom and pour over the mixture of cream, eggs, leeks, and scallops . Trim the excess pastry with a small knife, trimming the edge of the mold .
Distribute an additional handful of thyme on the surface and bake the finished quiche in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 35 minutes (convection oven at 320°F for about 25 minutes). Once cooked, remove your quiche with scallops and leeks from the oven and let it cool before serving .
The quiche with scallops and leeks can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of 3 days. It can be frozen if you have used fresh ingredients.
Using smaller molds, like tartlet molds, you can create appealing and refined finger food.
