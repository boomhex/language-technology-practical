Risotto ai fasolari is one of those dishes that really brings out the magic of the Veneto region—simple yet clever tricks to make seafood risotto taste amazingly fresh. Honestly, the fasolari, those tender shellfish from the Upper Adriatic, are just bursting with natural flavor. Thing is, folks there use the liquid from the fasolari to cook the rice. No need for much salt—the briny clam broth handles it. Pretty smart, right? That’s why this clam risotto stands out from other Italian risotto recipes . The rice? Creamy and light, with every flavor in balance. Here's the deal, you wait until the rice is nearly done before adding the fasolari. Keeps them moist—and not rubbery.
There’s something really special, you know, about a true seafood risotto from Veneto. Just a few final touches make it sing. At the end, you throw on some grated Parmigiano Reggiano and a sprinkle of lemon zest. That zesty kick? Makes everything pop. It’s the kind of classic move you see in many traditional Italian risotto recipes, especially by the sea where simplicity rules. You get this silky, somewhat golden dish, packed with ocean taste. People love it at big family meals or when friends swing by. Feels like dining at a tiny trattoria on the Adriatic coast. For real. It’s homemade but has that fresh seafood zing, like shellfish just plucked from the water.
If you’re into making homemade seafood risotto that's both easy and impressive, this recipe is one to keep. Really really worth it, especially if you’re craving real authentic Italian seafood dishes without all the fuss. Whether it's a cozy night or a special occasion, this dish brings a slice of Italy’s coast right to your table. Super tasty.
To prepare risotto with clams, start by cleaning the mollusks (following the instructions you can find How to clean fasolari for more details): open the raw mollusks by holding them by the shorter side of the shell, then cut the two internal side muscles . Collect their water during the opening and detach the clams from the shells. Pound each mollusk with a meat tenderizer ,
then coarsely chop it and set it aside (4-5). Strain the collected water and keep it aside as well .
In a pan, sauté the two garlic cloves with extra virgin olive oil. Once they are golden, remove them and add the rice; toast it for a few minutes over low heat, stirring it often to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot, then deglaze with white wine .
Continue cooking, always over low heat, for about 20 minutes, gradually adding the clam liquid (remember to wet the rice only when it has absorbed all the previously poured liquid). Since the clam water is very salty, we suggest tasting the rice: if it turns out to be too salty, you can alternate the clam liquid with fish broth or water. When the rice is almost done cooking, add the clams , plenty of chopped parsley and mix everything well with the help of a wooden spoon.
As soon as the rice has reached the desired cooking, turn off the heat; cream with butter, Parmigiano Reggiano , and the zest of half a lemon . Your risotto with clams is ready, serve it and enjoy immediately .
You can store the risotto with clams in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to one day.
