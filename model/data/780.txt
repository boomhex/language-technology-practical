We recommend consuming the spaghettoni with scimudin fondue immediately.
If you can't find scimudin, you can replace it with another soft cheese like Taleggio. Pesteda is a typical aromatic mix from Valtellina, a blend made of garlic, salt, pepper, dwarf yarrow leaves, and thyme. Alternatively, you can flavor it with some black pepper!
