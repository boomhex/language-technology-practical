To prepare sautéed rice with shrimp and cashews, start by squeezing the lime juice ; then clean and dice the carrot , and the lemongrass (you can use lemon or lime zest if you don't have it at home).
Take half a bell pepper, remove the seeds, and cut it into strips and then dice it , then trim and cut the green beans into pieces . Then clean the fresh ginger
and remove the seeds from the fresh chili before chopping it. Move on to the shrimp tails: shell them and cut the back to remove the intestine, the black thread, gently pulling it out with a toothpick.
Drizzle the shrimp tails with lime juice , soy sauce , and add the honey :
mix , cover with plastic wrap, and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, boil the rice in plenty of salted water and when al dente, drain it, rinse it under cold running water, then let it rest on a tray, fluffing it with a whisk . You can use either basmati or thaibonnet rice.
In a wok pan, prepare the seasoning: pour the seed oil, the garlic clove, the chili, the fresh ginger pieces, the lemongrass, and the spring onion. Sauté for three minutes over high heat, then add the green beans and continue cooking over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spatula. Then remove the garlic clove and lemongrass . Add the bell peppers ,
deglaze with soy sauce , then add the carrots and continue cooking, stirring occasionally so that the vegetables do not burn. If necessary, deglaze with a little water .
Toast the cashews in a pan for a few minutes, stirring so they don't smoke too much , then let them cool slightly and chop them . Beat the eggs in a small bowl .
When the vegetables are flavored and softened, pour the rice into the wok , mix and add the marinated shrimp ; mix then create a space in the center and pour the beaten eggs ; salt and pepper to taste. A light "crumble" of eggs will form by mixing.
Then pour in the toasted and chopped cashews and flavor with the grated lime zest . Serve the sautéed rice with shrimp and cashews on a serving plate or create molds using, for example, single-use aluminum molds to give shape!
Store the sautéed rice with shrimp and cashews for 1-2 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer, you can omit the egg and replace the vegetables with those you prefer or those in season; the only rule: color!
