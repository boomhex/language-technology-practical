Wash and dry the iceberg lettuce leaves, finely chop them , and place them in a large salad bowl. With the help of a peeler, peel and cut the carrots into ribbons ; again with the peeler, create curls from a whole piece of Parmigiano Reggiano (or Grana Padano).
Finely chop the parsley and the anchovy fillets and place them in a bowl with some oil (and vinegar if you like), salt, and ground pepper; mix the ingredients with a fork and let them rest for a few minutes.
Take the slices of sandwich bread, remove the darker crusts , and cut them into 1/2 inch cubes (8-9).
Place two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a pan, heat it, and then toss in the bread cubes over medium heat , turning them on all sides to brown them fully. Once browned, place them on kitchen paper towels to drain excess oil . Add the carrots to the iceberg lettuce ,
the parmesan curls , and the parsley and oil dressing : gently mix the ingredients, divide the salad into serving plates, and then add the crispy croutons . Serve immediately.
If you want to make the crispy salad lighter, instead of frying the croutons in olive oil, you can toast them in the oven or in a non-stick pan without adding any dressing.
