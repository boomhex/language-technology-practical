To prepare the classic Amatriciana pastries, cut the guanciale into strips and quarter the cherry tomatoes after washing them well . Use a vegetable peeler to create flakes from the pecorino romano and set them aside.
In a non-stick pan, sauté the guanciale and once it is well-browned, add the cherry tomatoes and let them cook together for a few minutes to enhance their flavors. Once ready, assemble the classic Amatriciana pastries: place one or two flakes of pecorino on each pastry ,
add a tablespoon of sautéed cherry tomatoes , and finally a couple of strips of golden guanciale . Season all the pastries this way and finish with a generous grind of black pepper : the classic Amatriciana pastries are ready!
Enjoy the classic Amatriciana pastries freshly made!
