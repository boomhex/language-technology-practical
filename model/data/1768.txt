Piadina with fried sardines and burrata is the perfect example of how two different regions in Italy can come together on a plate. And listen, Emilia-Romagna brings the classic piadina recipe —that soft, golden Italian flatbread that's just right for folding around tasty fillings—while Puglia throws in its legendary burrata cheese . Really good stuff. You'd find this combo at a beachside café, especially when it’s warm, and everyone wants something creamy and fresh.
What makes this dish so, so different is the way the crispy fried sardines team up with the smooth burrata. You get a bite that's both tender from the cheese and crunchy from the fish, all wrapped in that warm, slightly chewy bread. And you know what? People around the Mediterranean love this style, because it’s packed with local ingredients and flavors that scream summer.
Freshness is key here. You taste it in every bite. Sardines caught that day and fried up until golden give you that pop of salty, almost sweet seafood flavor that’s totally different from anything out of a can. And when you add those fried sardines to that rich, milky burrata, you get a mix that's hard to beat. Seriously good.
Folks in Emilia-Romagna typically fill their piadina with cured meats or simple cheeses, but using Puglian burrata adds a creamy twist that really elevates the experience. This isn’t just a regular seafood sandwich —it’s a mash-up of two traditions, perfect for a relaxed lunch or even an easy burrata appetizer to share with friends.
Plus, you'll find plenty of Italian recipes, but this one brings together the best of both regions in a way that feels special without being fussy. Every bite gives you a taste of summer, the sea, and that fun, lively vibe you get from Italian food when everyone's just hanging out and enjoying life. Really, whether you are at a picnic or a cozy dinner, this dish captures the heart of Italy's coastal charm and culinary creativity. For sure.
To prepare the flatbread with fried sardines and burrata, start by cleaning the sardines: remove the head , cut along the back , open them like a book ,
lift the central bone and remove it down to the tail (4-5). Clean the inside thoroughly from any remains ,
cut away the side parts and rinse the fillets well under running water. Dry the fillets thoroughly; heat a pan with oil and ensure the temperature does not exceed 356°F. While the oil is heating up, prepare the other ingredients so that you can quickly assemble the flatbreads: wash and dry the salad greens thoroughly. Cut the yellow cherry tomatoes in half , then chop the burrata .
Mix all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and rice flour in a bowl. Dredge the sardines and fry a few at a time in the hot oil : it will take just a few minutes for them to become golden brown. Drain the sardines as you go ,
placing them on a tray lined with kitchen paper to absorb the excess oil and season with salt . In a large pan, heat the flatbread on both sides for about 2 minutes . Top half of the flatbread with salad greens, 5-6 fried sardines ,
some yellow cherry tomatoes , and a couple of tablespoons of burrata . Fold the flatbread with fried sardines and burrata and serve it hot.
It is recommended to consume the flatbread with fried sardines and burrata immediately.
You can replace the yellow cherry tomatoes with red cherry tomatoes and use arugula instead of salad greens!
