Fasolari gratinati is a classic from the Alto Adriatico . And I gotta say, it really shows off how amazing baked clams can be when you start with super tender and super-fresh mollusks. People in that part of Italy just love these fasolari—no question—because their meat is delicate and naturally juicy, which makes every bite special compared to regular clams. So here's the thing, the magic of this dish is the way the clams get coated with a mix of seasoned breadcrumbs, a bit of garlic, and some parsley. Once they hit the oven, the topping turns crispy, while the inside stays moist. Can't go wrong. There’s this really good contrast between the soft, mild flavor of the clams and the crunchy, golden breadcrumb layer on top. It’s not just about flavor—it’s about texture, too. Really. And that’s what keeps people coming back for more at family gatherings and special dinners.
Opening raw fasolari shells? Yeah, it’s often the toughest part when making stuffed clams like this. But, truthfully, with a bit of practice or a quick video tutorial, it becomes easier and is totally worth it. In the Alto Adriatico , this style of breadcrumb-topped clams is a popular starter at seaside restaurants or at home on holidays—seriously good. Locals use fasolari because their sweet, gentle taste really shines with the traditional Italian gratin method. This isn’t your typical clams oreganata —the flavor is way way more refined and lets the seafood shine. Some families add a little lemon zest or a splash of white wine to the crumbs for a brighter taste, but the main thing is always that golden baked finish. If you’re into Italian baked clams or just looking for a new seafood appetizer , fasolari gratinati is one of those easy clam recipes that feels both fancy and comforting. Pretty much. It’s a great way to bring the Adriatic coast right to your table, no matter where you are.
To prepare the gratinated fasolari, open the raw fasolari , collect their juice during the opening , detach them from the shells, which you will set aside, and pound the mollusks with a meat tenderizer .
On a cutting board with a knife, roughly chop the fasolari and keep them in a bowl (4-5). Strain the collected juice and set everything aside.
Now focus on the filling: remove the crust from the bread and cut the crumb into pieces . Place the crumb in a mixer and chop it, then mix it with the chopped parsley .
the Grana Padano PDO , the crushed garlic , and the pepper: mix well with a spoon, blending everything with two tablespoons of oil. Finally, gradually add the fasolari juice ,
until you obtain a creamy mixture . Create strips with aluminum foil, fold them into circles, and place them under each fasolari shell to support them upright. Place the shells on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper .
Now add a tablespoon of chopped fasolari to each shell and cover each with a tablespoon of the bread mixture . Bake at 392°F for 25 minutes, then after this time, increase the temperature to the maximum and turn on the grill for 5 minutes until a golden crust forms on the surface . The gratinated fasolari will be ready to be served!
Store the gratinated fasolari in the refrigerator for up to a day.
Avoid using salt because the fasolari juice is already flavorful.
