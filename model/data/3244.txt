And here's the thing: mastering how to use gelatina in fogli is about achieving those golden, glossy desserts that slice clean but still melt in your mouth. Whether you’re following colla di pesce recipes for a Sunday lunch or a holiday treat, knowing how this ingredient works opens up a whole world of sweet and silky Italian dishes you’ll want to make again and again.

Let's see how to use gelatin sheets. Gelatin sheets are transparent and can have different weights . Before using them, they need to be rehydrated with cold water: take your sheet and cut it so it can be fully submerged in a bowl, then pour in cold water .
Leave it to soak for about 10 minutes . There is also powdered gelatin that does not require this treatment and can be used directly in the preparation. Once the gelatin sheets are soft, drain them in a fine mesh strainer to prevent losing pieces in the water. Finally, gently squeeze them with your hands .
Now to use the gelatin sheets, they need to be dissolved in a warm liquid like cream, fruit sauce, or broth for savory recipes, and then the whole mixture should be incorporated into the mixture to solidify. Remember that not much warm liquid is needed to dissolve the gelatin sheets, just a few tablespoons (7-8-9). Also, remember that if the gelatin needs to be added to a cold ingredient like whipped cream, you should let it cool to room temperature first to prevent the gelatin from clumping due to the temperature shock.
Most of the gelatin sheets produced for the food market are of porcine origin. Despite this, they are still better known as gelatin sheets because they were originally made from cartilage and other fish types.
