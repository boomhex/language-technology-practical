Add a refreshing drink, and you’re set for a perfect evening under the stars, enjoying the bright taste of Greece. Pretty simple, right?
To prepare the melon shots with feta bundles, start by cleaning the melon. Cut the melon into wedges and remove the seeds and inner filaments . Then, run the knife between the rind and the flesh to peel each slice and finally cut the flesh into large chunks .
Place the melon chunks in the blender cup and add the oil and a pinch of salt . Using an immersion blender, blend thoroughly
And then transfer the obtained puree into a pitcher . Place the pitcher in the fridge to keep your melon smoothie chilled. In the meantime, focus on the bundles, starting with the filling ingredients. Finely chop the red onion and set it aside. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half lengthwise and slice them into strips .
Finally, slice the strips into cubes . Set them aside and move on to the feta. First, cut it into strips and then into cubes about the same size as the cherry tomato cubes. Finely chop the chives .
In a large bowl, pour in the onion, cherry tomatoes , feta , and sliced olives
And the chives . Season with oil and a pinch of salt : not much is needed as feta is quite salty on its own.
Mix well to combine the ingredients and set aside. Then lay two sheets of filo pastry measuring 18x13 inches one on top of the other, placing them on the working surface with the long side at the base. Using a pair of scissors, cut 8 strips that are 2.5 inches wide . Brush the strips with a bit of water to rehydrate them .
Place a small spoonful of filling at the base of the filo strip , and fold one end to create a triangle enclosing the filling . Fold the same way with the newly formed triangle along the strip
and continue this way until you reach the end of the strip. Brush the last flap with a bit of water before folding it to seal your bundle . Repeat this process for the other 7 bundles, then repeat with the other 2 sheets of filo pastry to make the remaining 8 bundles. In total, you will have 16. Heat the seed oil in a deep pan, and when it reaches a temperature of 340-355°F, immerse a couple of bundles at a time, frying them for about half a minute on each side until golden brown.
Drain the bundles on paper towels and lightly salt the surface . Retrieve the smoothie pitcher from the fridge, pour it into 4 small glasses, and sprinkle each with a bit of pepper . Serve the feta bundles piping hot, accompanied by the melon shots .
The feta bundles are best enjoyed fresh, but you can prepare them a day in advance, lay them on a tray covered with parchment paper, wrap with plastic wrap, and store them in the fridge until ready to fry. You can also freeze them, arranged on a tray in the same way, if you used all fresh ingredients and not previously frozen ones. The melon smoothie can be stored in the fridge covered for up to 1 day.
