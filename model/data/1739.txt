instructions:
To prepare the mackerel en papillote, first clean the mackerels: cut the belly with a knife and eviscerate the fish , then rinse under running water to clean it .
Now wash the vegetables and clean them: trim the celery and cut it into small cubes , then slice the eggplants and cut them into small cubes . Remove the seeds and stem from the bell pepper .
and cut it first into strips and then into cubes . Finally, cut the tomatoes into small cubes as well . Transfer all the chopped vegetables into a bowl, season with fresh basil leaves .
and dress with olive oil, salt, and pepper . Now place each cleaned mackerel on a sheet of parchment paper about 14x12 inches , fill the mackerel's belly with a spoonful of vegetables , and then distribute the rest around the fish (make sure to use about ¼ of the prepared vegetables for each mackerel).
Drizzle the fish with a little olive oil . Wash the lemon and cut it into thin slices , then place 3 lemon slices on each mackerel .
Now close the parchment by lifting the edges of the parchment paper and overlapping them over the fish , then seal well by folding the sides .
Place the packets on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 20 minutes. Once cooked, take your mackerels out of the oven and serve them hot .
The mackerel en papillote can be stored in the fridge for up to one day. We do not recommend freezing after cooking.
