Spaghetti con ragù bianco ai carciofi is one of those delicious pasta dishes you’ll spot all over Northern and Central Italy, especially when those artichokes—so tasty—are at their peak in the cooler months. This version, well, it’s a mix of savory meats like loose sausage and veal mince with tender artichokes. They're sliced super thin, which is great, so they melt right into the sauce.
The ragù bianco builds slowly with white wine and broth, resulting in a sauce that's moist but not heavy—way, way better than you'd think. Usually seasoned with black pepper and thyme, it gives you that classic tangy herbal flavor found in so many traditional Italian recipes. The result? A plate of spaghetti that feels so special, even when you’re just sharing it at home with friends or family.
And look, in Italy, pasta con carciofi is often the star of a meal. Maybe there’s a light salad before and a little dessert after. It’s filling enough to make everyone happy, yet balanced so you don’t feel weighed down. Plus, the artichokes add this earthy sweetness, while the meats provide a rich and savory bite. It's different from your usual tomato sauces.
Regional cooks love this kind of pasta al ragù bianco because it highlights local veggies and good meat, creating layers of flavor that really really linger. It’s all about cucina casalinga—Italian home cooking—that focuses on who’s around the table, not on fancy details. Seriously, serve a big bowl, pass the black pepper, and enjoy how this primo brings everyone together, just like the best primi piatti con carciofi do.
For anyone into cucina italiana or looking for something different from the usual red sauce, spaghetti con ragù bianco ai carciofi is a perfect choice, no question.
To prepare spaghetti with white artichoke ragù, start with the How to clean artichokes , removing the outermost leaves and keeping only the heart. Remember to always keep the artichokes in acidulated water with lemon during cleaning, to prevent them from turning black . Once cleaned on the outside, cut the hearts in half and remove the dry and hairy part, the choke of the artichoke .
Cut both the stems and the artichoke into thin slices and place them in water and lemon to prevent browning . Take the sausage and, with a small knife, slit the skin , remove it and
crumble the sausage well in a bowl . Add the minced veal to the sausage and mix the two meats with a fork. In a non-stick pan, add the oil and a crushed garlic clove
and, after the garlic turns golden, add the meat and cook for 15 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon to ensure even cooking . Deglaze with white wine and let the wine evaporate.
Drain the artichokes and add them to the ragù in the pan . Continue to cook over medium heat for 15-20 minutes until the artichokes become tender; season with salt and pepper ;
flavor everything with thyme and continue cooking the ragù for another 10-15 minutes, adding a couple of ladles of broth when the preparation becomes too dry. The white ragù should be well-cooked, and the artichokes should be tender .
Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in plenty of salted boiling water . When al dente, drain them and add them directly to the ragù in the pan ; mix everything carefully, making sure not to break the artichokes while stirring. To make the sauce thicker, add another ladle of broth and sauté the pasta in the pan for a couple of minutes: your spaghetti with white artichoke ragù is ready . Enjoy your meal!
Store the spaghetti with white artichoke ragù in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for a couple of days. You can prepare the ragù 1-2 days in advance, keep it covered in the fridge, and then use it to dress the freshly cooked spaghetti. You can freeze the ragù if you use only fresh ingredients.
For the ragù, we chose the flavorful mix of sausage and minced veal, but naturally, you can adapt the combination to your taste, for example with minced pork instead of sausage and minced beef or chicken instead of veal. If you don't like white pasta, add 4-5 tablespoons of tomato purée, and there you go!
