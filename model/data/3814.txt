instructions:
Place 2 cups of flour for chapati in a bowl (alternatively, you can use 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 0.5 cup of all-purpose flour), dissolve the salt in room temperature water and then gradually pour it into the flour. With the help of a spoon or your fingers, knead the flour with the water; then continue to work the dough on a floured surface for at least 10 minutes, until you obtain a firm and smooth dough , then form a ball, place it in a bowl, cover it, and let it rest for 20 minutes. After the resting time, shape the dough into a long form .
Immediately after, divide the dough into 8 pieces , each weighing about 1.75 oz; with the help of a rolling pin, roll the balls into thin discs measuring 6 inches in diameter . While rolling out the dough, put a little flour on the rolling pin and the work surface to prevent the dough from sticking. Heat a crepe pan or a non-stick pan, and when it is very hot, cook the dough discs one at a time . When you see bubbles start to form, or after a couple of minutes, flip the dough disc and cook it on the other side. At this point, remove the chapati from the heat and place it in an aluminum foil lined with kitchen paper towels; close it to keep the chapati warm and soft, and continue this way until you run out of dough discs.
If you use the traditional iron pan called tawa for cooking chapati, the cooking times will be significantly shorter; in this case, after heating the pan very well, you just need to place the dough disc on it and cook it for 30 seconds, then flip it and continue cooking for another 30 seconds. It is also possible to cook the chapati directly on the fire by placing a stainless-steel flame diffuser over the burner.
