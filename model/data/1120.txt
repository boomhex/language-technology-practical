To prepare the tricolor meatballs, first wash and trim the zucchini. Then grate them with a coarse grater . Transfer to a colander, lightly salt and let rest to remove the excess water. In the meantime, peel the potatoes, wash them, and cut them into cubes .
Place them in a microwave steam cooker and cook for 8 minutes (alternatively, you can use a traditional steamer and cook the potatoes until they are tender, which will take about 20 minutes). In the meantime, chop the parsley, crush the garlic , and combine them. Pour the hot potatoes into a bowl and mash them with a fork .
Lightly squeeze the zucchini to remove excess water and add them to the potatoes. Mix well . Then add the beaten egg, one-third of the garlic and parsley mixture, 4 tablespoons of breadcrumbs, the grated cheese, and a pinch of salt . Mix very well until the mixture is uniform .
With damp hands, form small meatballs and roll them in the pistachio crumbs, making sure they adhere well . Continue this way until you finish the mixture . Keep the meatballs in the fridge until it’s time to fry. Now move on to the beef meatballs. Transfer the meat to a bowl, add one-third of the chopped garlic and parsley. Add an egg and a pinch of salt
and add the tomato paste and 3 tablespoons of breadcrumbs. Knead until you have a homogeneous mixture . Then form the meatballs, they should be the same size as the zucchini ones .
Place them on a plate , cover with plastic wrap, and transfer to the fridge until use. Now move on to the chicken meatballs. Transfer the meat to another bowl, crack the egg into it, and add the remaining garlic and parsley mixture, a pinch of salt , and 3 tablespoons of breadcrumbs .
Knead with your hands until you get a homogeneous mixture . Form the meatballs as done previously , cover with plastic wrap, and store in the fridge until cooking. Heat the oil in a pan and fry the meatballs, starting with the zucchini ones. Turn them often until they are golden brown.
Transfer them to paper towels using two forks or a slotted spoon . In the same oil, fry the beef meatballs, being careful not to overheat the oil and turning them often . Drain the meatballs and transfer them, also, onto paper towels.
Proceed in the same way with frying the chicken meatballs . When they are golden brown, drain them on a paper towel . You can serve your meatballs on three different plates or use them to make skewers!
It is recommended to consume the meatballs immediately after frying. The meatball mixtures can be stored in the fridge for up to 12 hours, making sure to cover the bowls with plastic wrap. The meat and chicken meatballs can be arranged on a tray and frozen.
You can add grated lemon zest to the chicken meatballs.
