With the recipe for breaded swordfish, we take a dive into the Mediterranean, savoring aromas and scents that come from the sea to our table. The swordfish is the star of many genuine and appetizing recipes: remember the pistachio crusted swordfish , refined and delicious, or the Swordfish in Salmoriglio , exquisitely marinated. This recipe is equally delightful, where you will discover a golden and crispy coating that envelops the slices, a flavorful breading made with breadcrumbs and Pecorino! A quick grill cooking will be enough, and in no time, you will bring to the table a succulent and tasty fish dish.

To prepare your breaded swordfish, get some swordfish steaks and remove the skin if present . Wash and finely chop the parsley . Combine in a low, wide bowl the breadcrumbs, the Pecorino .
Then add parsley , salt , and pepper to taste. Mix well to combine the flavors. Brush the slices with olive oil on both sides .
Now bread the slices well on both sides and place the fish on a tray . Heat a grill very well over the fire, greasing it with a little oil .
When the grill is very hot, place the swordfish slices on it and let them cook for about 5 minutes per side, until they are cooked and golden . Serve the breaded swordfish immediately with a few slices of lemon .
It keeps in the refrigerator for 2 days covered, but immediate consumption is recommended.
We recommend not overcooking the swordfish; otherwise, the flesh will become dry.
