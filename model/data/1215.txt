instructions:
To prepare the Fano-style pot roast, first chop the onion and place it in a large pan with the oil and the whole peeled garlic . Let it sauté over moderate heat for a few minutes so that the onion becomes tender. Meanwhile, take the meat and stud it with the cloves .
Season with grated nutmeg , pepper , and salt .
Place the meat in the pan and sear it on all sides, then flavor with the herbs and deglaze with the wine and let it evaporate.
Meanwhile, heat the water and dissolve the concentrate in it , stir to blend, then pour it directly into the pan with the meat .
Cover with the lid and continue cooking for 90 minutes. At this point, the meat will be ready , remove it from the pot and slice it once it has cooled .
Meanwhile, continue cooking the gravy for another 30 minutes so that it thickens , then remove the garlic . Serve the Fano-style pot roast along with the cooking sauce .
Fano-style pot roast can be stored in the fridge for 2-3 days. You can freeze it if you've used fresh ingredients.
Never use a fork to turn the meat during cooking, otherwise it will lose its precious juices that keep it tender.
