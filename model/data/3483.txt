Here’s how to proceed to prepare the no-knead ciabatta. Pour the flour into a large bowl, then add the dry yeast . Dissolve the salt and malt in warm water , mix well, and then pour the mixture into the bowl with flour and yeast.
Mix just enough to combine the ingredients , then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature (put the bowl inside the turned-off oven) for at least 18 hours. After the indicated time, the dough should have a bubbly and rather sticky consistency. Take a baking sheet, slightly oil it with extra virgin olive oil.
and sprinkle it with cornmeal . On a work surface, spray some water and place a piece of plastic wrap on top .
Sprinkle the plastic wrap with plenty of all-purpose flour . Pour the dough over the floured wrap and, flouring your hands, give it a fairly flat and elongated shape. Move the wrap close to the baking sheet and with a decisive motion, flip the dough onto it .
Reshape it into a flat and elongated form, sprinkle flour on the surface , then cover the ciabatta with a clean cloth and let it rise for another two hours at 86°F. After the two hours, bake it in a preheated oven for 40 minutes at 428°F. Once the no-knead ciabatta has a hazel crust, take it out of the oven .
Store the no-knead ciabatta in a plastic bag for up to 4-5 days. Once baked, it is possible to freeze it; when ready to serve, defrost it in the refrigerator and reheat in the oven for a few minutes.
Two tips: if you fear you may not manage to flip the dough onto the baking tray in one go, I suggest asking someone for help, to keep the floor safe; if you grease the baking sheet with 3-4 tablespoons of oil, you will get a cross between a ciabatta and a focaccia: oily, sure, but extraordinarily tasty.
