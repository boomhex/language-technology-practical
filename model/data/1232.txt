instructions:
To prepare the smoked bacon sauce, start by cleaning and cutting the ingredients for cooking: finely chop the celery and onion . Then, chop the chili pepper, removing the seeds to make it less spicy .
Remove the rind and cut the smoked bacon into small pieces . Finally, chop the peeled tomatoes into small pieces .
Heat some oil in a pan and then, on low heat, brown the bacon with the onion, celery , and chili pepper .
Cook for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally, so the vegetables will be wilted and the bacon browned . Deglaze with wine and let it evaporate , then add the peeled tomatoes .
Tear the basil with your hands and season with salt and pepper . Cook the sauce for about twenty minutes or until it is dry enough or has reached the desired consistency. The bacon sauce is ready to be added .
The smoked bacon sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. If needed, you could also freeze it to dress pasta on the spot.
