instructions:
To prepare pasta with anchovies, start by pouring the anchovies into a pan with oil and stir often so they don't dissolve completely. Then add finely chopped garlic followed by pine nuts and raisins , and let them flavor for a couple of minutes.

At this point, add the tomato paste and water . Add salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar, cover it, and let it cook for 10 minutes on low heat .
Meanwhile, put the pot with water for pasta on the stove and also prepare the "toasted breadcrumbs" (i.e., toasted breadcrumbs). Put the almonds in a bag and crush them coarsely with a meat mallet or weight . Pour the breadcrumbs into a non-stick pan and add the crumbled almonds .
Add oil and a pinch of salt, then toast over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent burning : it should become a nice toasted color. At this point, cook salted boiling water and cook the pasta . When it's al dente, drain it into the pot to adjust with the sauce, stir , and serve your pasta with anchovies with a sprinkle of toasted breadcrumbs and chopped parsley if desired.
Once the pasta with anchovies is ready, it's best to consume it immediately.
If you wish, you can prepare the sauce in advance and store it in the refrigerator for up to two days.
The original toasted breadcrumbs are without almonds, so you can omit them if you don't like them. Adding them will give a touch of crunchiness and uniqueness to the dish.
