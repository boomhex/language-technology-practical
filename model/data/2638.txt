To prepare the salmon quiche with potatoes and radicchio, first prepare the Easy Shortcrust Pastry : in a food processor with blades, place the sifted flour, cold butter cut into cubes, and salt . Add thyme and oregano leaves , then blend until you get a sandy mixture; place the mixture on a work surface, create a well in the center, and then pour in the ice-cold water gradually .
Knead the sandy mixture by hand for at most 5 minutes until you obtain a homogeneous dough; make a loaf and then wrap it in plastic wrap , letting it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. In the meantime, take care of the vegetables and fish: wash the radicchio and potatoes with plenty of fresh running water; remove the hard core of the radicchio and then cut it into strips .
Peel the potatoes and slice them with a smooth bladed mandolin , cut them into strips , and then set them aside in a bowl full of water. Take the salmon, remove any bones with kitchen tweezers, and then cut it into fairly large chunks .
In a separate bowl, pour the whole eggs and the yolk ; add the grated lemon zest , dill, keeping a few leaves aside, and salt .
Season with pepper to taste and then mix well with a hand whisk, gradually adding fresh cream ; when the ingredients have blended well, cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator. After 30 minutes, take the brisè pastry and roll it out on a floured work surface to a thickness of 1/5 inch and a size of 12 inches in diameter .
Butter and flour an 11-inch diameter pie pan; roll the brisè pastry around the rolling pin and lay it over the pie pan , making it adhere well to the bottom and sides. Press with the rolling pin to remove the excess pastry , keeping it for the final decoration. Prick the base of the brisè pastry with a fork and then pour in the egg and cream mixture, reserving a small amount to brush the quiche before baking .
At this point, fill with the radicchio and potatoes you have previously cut , reserving some of both vegetables for the final decoration. Distribute the filling evenly with a fork, covering the vegetables with the egg-based filling ; also add the salmon chunks, placing them gently over the entire surface of the pie .
Decorate the surface of the quiche with dill and the potatoes you set aside, arranging them in a radial pattern around the pie and in the center, where you can add the leftover radicchio . At this point, take the leftover dough and work it with your hands to make 2 long rolls to decorate the perimeter of the savory pie ;
Twist the 2 rolls together, sealing the ends, and then gently place the decoration all around the pie . Brush the edges with the egg and cream mixture you set aside and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 50 minutes (or 320°F for 40 minutes if using a convection oven). Finally, remove from the oven, let cool slightly, and serve the salmon quiche with potatoes and radicchio .
You can store the salmon quiche with potatoes and radicchio covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator for up to 2 days after cooking. Once cooked, you can freeze it only if you've used fresh ingredients.
I suggest trying a tasty alternative that's just as good and flavorful: try using zucchini instead of potatoes and you'll see how delicious it is!
