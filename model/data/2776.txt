instructions:
To prepare the lemon loin rolls, start with the filling: take a loaf, remove the crust with a knife and cut the crumb into cubes . Transfer the crumb to a food processor, season with curly parsley ,
marjoram leaves, thyme , then grate the zest of an orange and a lemon ,
drizzle with olive oil and mince the mixture until you get a sandy and well-blended filling . Set aside the filling and work on the meat: place the loin slices between two sheets of parchment paper and pound with a meat mallet to make them thin and tender; this process will also prevent the meat fibers from breaking.
Salt the loin and spread the crumb mixture on the slices with a spoon , keeping a few spoonfuls of filling aside. Now roll the slices
and secure them with a toothpick . Once the rolls are assembled, transfer them to an oiled baking dish, cover them with the crumb mixture, and drizzle with a little olive oil . Bake the rolls in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 15 minutes (or in a ventilated oven at 320°F for 10 minutes). Once cooked, serve the lemon loin rolls hot, accompanied by a fresh salad !
It is recommended to consume the lemon rolls immediately; if they are left over, you can store them in the refrigerator for a couple of days in an airtight container. It is possible to freeze the rolls if you used fresh not defrosted ingredients.
Don't like loin? No worries, you can simply replace it with chicken or veal.
If you crave a more exotic flavor, use grapefruit and lime as citrus fruits.
Alternatively to baking, you can cook the rolls in a pan and deglaze with citrus juice; they will be just as tasty!
