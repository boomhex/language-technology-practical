So, next time you’re looking for something special, try your hand at treccia salata and experience the rich culinary traditions of Italy’s beautiful Ligurian coast.
To prepare the savory braid, first peel the potatoes , cut them into pieces, and boil them until they are cooked. Then drain and mash them. While the potatoes cook, dissolve the fresh yeast (or 4 g of dry yeast) and the malt (or sugar) in the lukewarm water .
In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, pour in the flour, the mashed and cooled potatoes, and the water with malt and yeast . Then add the oil and the egg while keeping the mixer running.
Lastly, add the salt and knead the mixture until smooth and homogeneous. Transfer it to a large bowl sprinkled with a little flour and let it rise covered with plastic wrap at a temperature of 80-82°F for at least 2 hours. Meanwhile, in a pan, sauté the diced zucchini, peppers, and eggplant for a few minutes (they should be softened but still firm).
Then cut the caciocavallo cheese and the spicy salami into cubes. After the necessary time, take the dough which will have doubled in volume .
Divide it into three equal parts and roll each into an oval 20 inches long and 6 inches wide . Place the three different fillings in the center of the three dough ovals: the vegetables
the caciocavallo cheese and the spicy salami ; brush the edges with water using a kitchen brush
and seal each dough oval so that the filling does not spill out during cooking . Then join the three strands of leavened dough at one end and braid them together .
When finished, place the braid on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush it with a beaten egg mixed with two tablespoons of cream (or milk) ; bake the savory braid in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 50-60 minutes (at 320°F for about 45-55 minutes if using a fan oven). Remove the savory braid from the oven and slice it to enjoy with your guests !
Store the cooked savory braid under a glass dome or covered with plastic wrap. If you've used only fresh, non-defrosted ingredients, you can freeze it raw, defrost it in the fridge, and then bake it in the oven. Alternatively, you can freeze the dough after the second rise, then defrost it in the fridge and bring it to room temperature before working with it.
The beauty of this recipe is that you can choose the fillings you prefer, also considering seasonality! Thus, zucchini, peppers, and eggplants become mushrooms, artichokes, broccoli, or tomatoes. The same goes for the other two fillings, with scamorza cheese instead of caciocavallo or diced cooked ham instead of spicy salami. If you want to add a scenic touch, after brushing the braid, you can sprinkle it with poppy, sesame, or pumpkin seeds!
