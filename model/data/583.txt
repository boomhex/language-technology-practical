instructions:
To prepare the chicken wings with the air fryer, wash the chicken wings, place them on a paper towel and pat them dry . Remove any feather remnants by burning them. Place the wings in a food-grade plastic bag .
Add the chili pepper , cumin , mustard , and garlic powder.
Salt them , close the bag and shake it vigorously to season the meat . Let the wings rest in the refrigerator for an hour in the bag so they absorb the flavors. Place the wings in the air fryer basket and cook at 392°F for 24 minutes. We used a 7-liter air fryer.
Turn them several times during cooking . Once ready , serve the chicken wings hot, accompanied by BBQ sauce .
You can store the air fryer chicken wings for one day in the refrigerator in an airtight container and reheat them before serving. We do not recommend freezing.
To make the wings more aromatic, you can let them marinate in the refrigerator for a day with an even richer mix of spices and seasonings: 1 teaspoon of brown sugar, 2 pinches of black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder, 1 teaspoon of onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon of paprika, and 3 pinches of salt.
