To prepare the pasta with asparagus, stracciatella, and zucchini flowers, start by cleaning the asparagus. Put a pot of water on the stove to later cook the pasta (salt as desired when boiling); then focus on the dressing: remove the end of the asparagus stalks and peel the outer part with a peeler . Using a knife, cut the end of the asparagus into pieces
and halve the tips . Heat a dash of oil in a pan and add the asparagus . Season with salt and pepper, then deglaze with the lemon juice
and cook for 7-8 minutes . Cook the pasta according to the package instructions . Move on to the zucchini flowers: clean them gently with a cloth, then cut off the base
remove the pistil and cut them into thin strips; set aside . Also, cut the cherry tomatoes, previously drained of their preserving oil, into strips. Once the pasta is al dente, drain it and transfer it directly into the pan with the asparagus .
Then add the zucchini flowers , the cherry tomatoes , and, with the heat off, finish with the stracciatella .
Mix everything with a wooden spoon , add fresh basil leaves , and serve your pasta with asparagus and zucchini flowers hot or warm !
It is recommended to consume the pasta with asparagus, stracciatella, and zucchini flowers immediately. If you want to serve it cold, store it in the refrigerator once it has cooled and add the stracciatella just before serving.
Transform this first course into a pasta salad by adding slightly sautéed baby zucchini in a pan, slices of pitted black olives, and the zest of an untreated lemon!
