Braciole al limone is one of those dishes that instantly transports you to a long Sunday lunch in Italy. Seriously good. Everyone's reaching for seconds. These braciole al limone ? They’re all about tender pork, amped up with this crispy, herby breading that brings so so much flavor in each bite. Now, the real magic—really—is in the panatura croccante . That's the crunchy coating made from breadcrumbs, fresh herbs, and pistachios. It gives such a unique nutty twist—super super tasty—that you just don't find everywhere. Some folks switch out pistachios for walnuts if that's what they’ve got. And look, both versions end up pretty moist and tasty.
And the succo di limone (lemon juice)? It really brightens everything up, making the pork feel fresh and zesty instead of heavy. It's classic cucina italiana, right? A bit of citrus to elevate meat dishes like these.
You know, on the side, people often serve these braciole impanate with homemade mayonnaise. Pretty smart. It doubles down on that creamy, rich feel next to the crispy pork. No one region claims this ricetta braciole al limone , but it fits into the Italian tradition of making a secondi that's comforting and a little fancy. The crunch from the pistachio and herb breading really sets it apart from your average braciole di maiale or something you’d just toss in the oven. It’s impressive on the plate, but pretty simple, and people always end up asking how you made it.
Sometimes, folks bake these braciole al forno to keep things lighter—works great. This second plate is a must-have when you want to impress or crave something golden and flavorful for dinner. Can't go wrong. Nothing beats the combo of a crispy outside, juicy meat, and that bright, lemony kick! With each bite, you’re tasting Italian tradition that's both simple and fancy. For real.
To prepare the lemon pork chops with crunchy coating, start by preparing the mixture for the coating. Take the thyme and rosemary sprigs and remove the leaves (1-2); place the shelled pistachios in a mixer .
Next, chop the leaves together with the pistachios and transfer the mixture obtained into a baking dish. Then pour the cornmeal for polenta and mix well with a spoon ; add salt and pepper to your liking and set the coating aside .
Now take care of the meat; on a cutting board, pound the pork chops with a meat mallet, covering them with parchment paper (this way, the meat fibers won't break and will remain tender) . In a baking dish, pour the lemon juice and immerse the pork chops in it for a few seconds .
Then pass the pork chops in the coating you prepared, making sure it adheres well on both sides ; once finished, place the pork chops on a tray lined with parchment paper . Heat a non-stick pan, pour the oil, and lay the breaded pork chops one at a time .
Cook over low heat for at least 20 minutes, remembering to turn the meat with kitchen tongs for even cooking . Brown the coating well and in the meantime, prepare the mayonnaise that will accompany the meat. Take the eggs at room temperature and separate the yolks from the whites. Place the yolks in a tall bowl and salt and pepper to your liking .
Pour the vinegar and start working the ingredients with an electric mixer. While you are whisking the eggs, also pour the seed oil in a very slow stream ; you must always mix in the same direction until you obtain a thick sauce .
When the mayonnaise is whipped, finish by adding the lemon juice and work for a few more moments with the beaters . If suddenly you see lumps in the mayonnaise, know that, as they say, it has 'curdled.' To remedy, set aside the curdled mayonnaise and in another container put another egg yolk; blend by adding a drizzle of oil and then, always in the container, add a teaspoon at a time of the curdled mayonnaise that you had set aside. After 20 minutes, check that the meat is cooked; to do this, you can use a skewer: if white liquid comes out, the meat is ready; if the liquid is pink, it will need further cooking. Turn off the heat and serve the lemon pork chops with crunchy coating accompanied by your mayonnaise .
It is recommended to consume the lemon pork chops with crunchy coating immediately. You can prepare the meat with the coating and store it still raw in the fridge covered with plastic wrap for up to one day. Keep the mayonnaise in the refrigerator in a tightly closed jar for up to 3-4 days.
