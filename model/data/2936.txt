If you're after a pear crumb cake that’s just, you know, really something, this American classic is your go-to. Inspired by those famous New York crumb cakes, this one has a moist layer packed with fresh pears—seriously good. Each bite gives you that juicy, soft fruit taste we all love, especially on those cozy fall days.
The real magic? It's in the crunchy lime-scented crumb topping. It totally wakes up the flavors, making everything feel light and exciting. I mean, the mix of the soft base and sweet fruit layer with that crisp topping? It’s perfect. Seriously. For brunch or a snack when you're craving something special, it’s unbeatable.
And here's the thing: this easy pear cake recipe is super versatile. While the pears give you that tender bite, you can switch them out for berries, apples, or whatever keeps things moist and fresh. So really, mix it up every time you bake it. Many people cut this pear coffee cake into squares—makes it a convenient grab-and-go treat. Great for after dinner or alongside your morning coffee.
Thing is, the lime zest in the crumbs adds this tangy kick. It perfectly balances the sweetness of the fruit. With its soft, fluffy base, this homemade pear cake fits right into any list of simple baking recipes. You get the best of both worlds: a little cake, a little fruit, and a topping that's just the right amount of crunchy without feeling too heavy.
Whether you stick with pears or throw in some autumn berries, it’s a go-to choice for anyone hunting for fall dessert recipes that really, really deliver on both flavor and texture. Pretty simple, right?
To prepare the pear crumb cake, start with the fruit: rinse the berries under running water . Then pat them dry with kitchen paper. Move on to the pears: cut them in half, separate the wider part from the rest of the fruit , and peel them to cut into slices about 3/8 inch thick .
Transfer the pear slices to a small bowl and sprinkle them with lemon juice to prevent them from browning while you proceed with the rest of the recipe. Cover the pear slices with plastic wrap and chill until ready to assemble the crumb cake. Then move on to the batter: in a bowl, add the softened butter in pieces and add the sugar ,
Beat the ingredients with an electric mixer or stand mixer to obtain a soft and homogeneous cream. Take the vanilla bean, split it open, and scrape out the seeds to add to the batter (you can alternatively use a teaspoon of vanilla extract or a packet of vanilla powder).
Continue by adding the eggs to the batter: first, the 3 whole eggs one at a time, mixing until fully incorporated, then adding the yolk . Work the ingredients until you obtain a homogeneous cream .
Finally, add the sifted flour and baking powder . Mix everything with a spatula until you get a consistency similar to that of a donut batter. Then grease a 8x12-inch pan using a pastry brush .
Then line it with parchment paper (you can also refer to the Cooking School: how to line a pan with parchment paper). Start pouring the batter into the pan , leveling it little by little with the back of a spoon slightly moistened with water, until the batter is used up .
Now you can add the pears drained from the lemon juice, arranging them evenly over the entire surface of the batter . Then add the berries , distributing them evenly . Keep the cake chilled and proceed to prepare the crumble.
In a small bowl, add the very cold butter, the brown sugar , the sifted all-purpose flour , and the almond flour (you can also finely grind almonds in a mixer and add them to the mixture, or replace the almond flour with the same amount of coconut flour).
Also, add two generous pinches of salt . Then grate the lime zest directly into the bowl and quickly mix everything with your fingertips .
Now that you have obtained the crumble , sprinkle it over the cake and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 60 minutes (320°F for 50-55 minutes if using a convection oven). When the crumb layer is slightly golden , your pear crumb cake will be ready to be taken out and enjoyed. The best way to serve the crumb cake is to cut it into cubes in the same pan!
Store the pear crumb cake in a cool place under a glass dome or tightly covered with plastic wrap for 2-3 days. You can also store it in the refrigerator and bring it back to room temperature half an hour before serving or warm it slightly in the microwave. You can freeze the pear crumb cake after it has cooled on the day you prepare it or the day after at the latest.
If you prefer, you can replace the berries with other seasonal fruit of your choice. Instead of almond flour, for the crumble, you can also use coconut flour, and instead of lime, grate the zest of an orange.
