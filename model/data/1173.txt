instructions:
To prepare the rum and rosemary cake, first pour the rum into a pitcher and add the rosemary sprigs . Cover with plastic wrap and let it macerate at room temperature for at least a night . After this time, strain the rum to remove the rosemary .
Place the eggs and sugar in a large bowl , start working with electric beaters and add the salt . When the mixture becomes light and frothy, pour in the seed oil slowly .
Then also add the flavored rum . In a separate bowl, sift the flour with the baking powder . Add one tablespoon of the dry ingredients at a time while continuing to beat with the beaters .
Finally, add the chopped rosemary and mix to incorporate evenly . Butter a 9-inch diameter cake pan and pour the obtained mixture inside , then bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 40 minutes.
After the baking time (always check with a toothpick), take out the cake and let it cool slightly in the pan . Once cooled, flip it onto a serving plate and dust the surface with powdered sugar . Your rum and rosemary cake is ready to be enjoyed !
The rum and rosemary cake can be stored at room temperature for 2-3 days, covered with a glass dome. You can freeze it in slices after it has completely cooled.
Those who love pairing rum with chocolate can enrich the cake with about 3 oz of dark chocolate chips!
