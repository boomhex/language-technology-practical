instructions:
Cartellate are a beloved staple during Christmas celebrations in Puglia , and these Italian Christmas pastries bring a sense of tradition and family togetherness to the table. Shaped like delicate roses, these crispy treats are made from thin dough that's carefully folded and pinched by hand—a practice passed down through generations in Apulian families. Thing is, the cartellate recipe isn’t just about food. It is really about everyone gathering in the kitchen, chatting, laughing, and sharing stories as they shape each piece. The aroma of frying dough fills the house, and look, something sweet and special is definitely on the way. Once the golden rounds come out of the hot oil, tradition calls for a good soak in rich, sticky vin cotto—a syrupy cooked grape must made from local Negroamaro and Malvasia grapes. That unique flavor instantly brings you to the heart of Southern Italy during the holidays.
In Puglia , traditional Apulian desserts like cartellate are never just about the basics. People get really creative with toppings: some drizzle honey or fig syrup for that extra sweet hit, while others sprinkle on chopped almonds, sugar, or even a little chocolate for a twist. These tender spirals are a real show of pride—seriously. You’ll see plates piled high at every family gathering or festive table. Unlike other deep-fried Italian sweets, cartellate really show off local flavors and customs, making them a favorite Puglia holiday treat . Sharing these honey-soaked pastries is a way to keep old traditions alive, and every family has their own little spin—maybe a different syrup or a special way of folding the dough. Biting into cartellate, you get a blend of crispy texture and sticky, moist sweetness that’s hard to forget. It's not just dessert; it's a connection to Puglia’s past. And the chance for everyone to add their own story to a classic, whether sticking to the authentic cartellate preparation or trying a few new toppings along the way. The joy of making and eating cartellate is a true celebration of the rich cultural heritage that defines this beautiful region.
To prepare the Apulian cartellate, start by making the dough: put the white wine and oil in a saucepan and heat slightly, up to a temperature of about 95°F. Place the sifted flour in a bowl and pour the oil and wine emulsion into the center .
Knead by hand until you get a compact consistency . Form a loaf and wrap it with plastic wrap ; let it rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes. After this time, take back the dough, remove it from the plastic wrap, take about half at a time and flatten it slightly on the work surface
before rolling it out with a pasta roller starting from the thickest setting until reaching a thickness of about 1/16 inch (if you don't have a pasta roller, you can easily roll out your dough with a rolling pin). From the dough sheet, use a fluted pastry cutter to cut rectangles
and from them, strips about 1 1/4 inches wide and 12-14 inches long. Now take each strip of dough and pinch the two edges of the short side together, sealing with finger pressure, to create little pockets spaced about 1 1/2 inches apart . Now roll the strips onto themselves forming roses, remembering to pinch the spiral in some points to prevent the cartellate from opening during frying . Once formed, place your cartellate on a rack or on a board, covered with a dry and clean cloth, to let them dry: 5-6 hours should be sufficient but, if you can, better overnight.
It's time to fry the cartellate: heat an abundant amount of seed oil in a high-sided pot, and when it reaches 340°F (use a kitchen thermometer to measure the correct temperature), immerse a few cartellate at a time . Fry the cartellate for 3-4 minutes per side, then drain them and let them dry on a rack so they stay crispy .
Now take care of the traditional cartellate topping: place the vin cotto in a saucepan and heat it slightly . Immerse the cartellate, a few at a time, to soak them on both sides , then place them on a serving plate and serve your cartellate immediately .
You can store the cartellate, formed and raw, for 1 week. However, we recommend frying them and soaking them in vin cotto only when you intend to enjoy them.
Another very common way to consume cartellate is with warm honey instead of vin cotto: the flavor will be less intense and distinctive, and suitable even for the little ones!
