instructions:
To prepare the pea velouté, start by preparing the Vegetable broth . When it's ready, peel the onion, then slice it ; in a saucepan, heat the oil slightly over low heat and add the onion . Let the onion sweat slightly over low heat, stirring often to prevent it from burning. Then add the peas (whether you use fresh or frozen peas, the procedure will be the same) ,
salt, pepper, and mix everything . Let it cook for about 5 minutes, then cover with 1 1/2 cups of vegetable broth (set aside 1/4 cup). Continue cooking for another 15-20 minutes, then turn off the heat and using an immersion blender ,
blend everything while gradually adding the reserved vegetable broth until you achieve a smooth consistency and the desired density . Add the fresh cream
turn the heat back on and continue cooking for another 5 minutes, stirring often . Transfer your pea cream into a sieve and strain it with the help of a spatula to make it even creamier .
Plate your pea velouté and garnish it with some Grana Padano flakes to taste before serving it hot or warm as you prefer !
The pea velouté can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days at most in an airtight container.
It can also be frozen in portions if you've used fresh, not previously frozen ingredients!
You can replace the cream with milk or use more vegetable broth instead.
To garnish the pea velouté more richly, instead of Grana Padano flakes, you could use diced bacon to sauté in a pan or make croutons to sauté separately in a pan with a little oil and herbs, or alternatively, pass them under the oven grill to make them golden and crispy!
