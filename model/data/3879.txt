To prepare the chilled peach cups with Dolcetto, start by washing and drying the peaches. Then peel them and cut them into small cubes of about 0.4 inches per side . Set aside. Then soak the gelatin in cold water for about 10 minutes .
Meanwhile, take a high-sided saucepan and pour in the Dolcetto , sugar , and zest of an untreated lemon (about 0.35 oz) . Heat over low heat until the sugar is completely dissolved. You can help dissolve it with a spoon.
At this point, remove the lemon peels and add the now-soaked gelatin . Stir it for a few seconds to melt it completely, and when it's dissolved, turn off the heat and let it cool to room temperature. Finally, take four glasses with a capacity of 1.5 cups and place 2.8 oz of peaches in each .
Pour the Dolcetto into each glass , taking care to fill them up to 0.4 inches from the edge of the glass. Then place the glasses in the refrigerator to solidify for at least 2 hours. Before serving, remove from the refrigerator and garnish with a few mint leaves . Now, all that is left is to enjoy your chilled peach cups with Dolcetto !
The peach cups with Dolcetto can be stored in the refrigerator covered with clear plastic wrap for up to 3-4 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
Try flavoring the wine with cinnamon and cloves or with orange zest to try alternative versions of these delicious cups!
Dolcetto identifies not only the wine but also the grape variety from which this wine is derived. 'Dolcetto' refers to 6 DOC wines and 1 DOCG, all from Piedmont. The grape variety, also of Piedmontese origin, was mentioned for the first time in a writing in 1799 (although it is plausible that its origins are much older). The name attributed to the grape variety is Dosset, from which the current indication of Dolcetto is derived.
