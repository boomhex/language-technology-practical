instructions:
To make the chicken bites with grapes, first wash the grape berries well, then pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, add the grapes , cover with the lid, and cook for 5 minutes over low heat. After this time turn off the heat and set aside.
Now take the chicken breast and cut it in half first and then into chunks . After peeling the outer parts of the leek, cut the base and then slice it thinly .
In a large pot, heat a drizzle of olive oil, add the leek , and let it sauté on low heat until soft, about 5 minutes. At this point, also add the chicken bites and increase the heat. Season with grated ginger
and stir . When the chicken is well browned on all sides, scent with thyme leaves , salt ,
pepper , and deglaze with Marsala wine . Let the wine evaporate and then add the cornstarch which will make the preparation creamy.
Now you can add the cooked grapes to the pot , stir, and cook over medium heat until the sauce thickens . Serve the chicken bites with grapes hot .
Chicken bites with grapes can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Freezing after cooking is not recommended.
As an alternative to Marsala, you can use a sweet wine like Moscato.
