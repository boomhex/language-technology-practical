instructions:
To make the zucchini rolls with sauce, first wash and trim the zucchini at the ends. Slice the zucchini with a mandolin to obtain thin slices, 1/16-1/8 inch thick at most . Prepare the filling: in a bowl, combine the ricotta (drained if very watery) and add the Parmesan cheese , the egg , salt, and pepper.
Mix with a spoon to blend the ingredients . Place a slice of zucchini on a cutting board, add the filling on one end with a teaspoon and spread it along the length with the back of the spoon .
Roll up to form a roll. Make all the rolls until the ingredients are used up . Prepare the sauce: sauté the garlic clove with the olive oil in a pan .
Pour the tomato purée , add the basil and salt. Cook for 10 minutes over medium heat, covered. Now remove the garlic .
Lower the heat and add the zucchini rolls . Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and cook for 15 minutes over low heat with the lid on. For the last 2-3 minutes, remove the lid and let the sauce thicken. Serve the hot zucchini rolls with sauce .
Zucchini rolls with sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
You can replace the ricotta with mozzarella to create a "pizzaiola" version!
