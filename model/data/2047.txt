Persimmon and pomegranate salad is such a fantastic dish! Seriously good. It showcases how Italian families blend flavors and colors during fall. Up in northern and central Italy, autumn is all about picking those ripe, juicy persimmons and tangy pomegranate seeds that just pop in your mouth. This persimmon salad gets its depth from slices of cachi mela, which are naturally sweet—almost creamy. Adding Pecorino gives it that buttery, bold punch. Every forkful is intriguing. Plus, the bright mix of red, orange, and white on the plate looks like a beautiful autumn scene. Using fresh greens as a base keeps it light and adds a little crunch alongside the softer fruits, making it pretty much a really good dish for any table.
And here's the thing: in Italy, autumn is about using seasonal ingredients. The persimmon and pomegranate salad really captures that traditional, homemade vibe. The crisp pomegranate balances the mellow, tender sweetness of persimmon, creating a pomegranate salad vibe that bursts with color and fresh flavor. Perfect for family lunches, this salad fits seamlessly into holiday spreads like Thanksgiving or Christmas, blending well with other fall salad recipes .

It's a fun way to bring a touch of Italy to your table, celebrate fall's best produce, and enjoy a seasonal fruit salad that's colorful and bursting with fresh flavors.

Thinly slice the Pecorino with a mandolin to obtain flakes . Then prepare the accompanying sauce by placing the mustard in a small bowl, pouring in the olive oil , and mixing .
Everything is ready to assemble the salad: in a large bowl, pour in the lamb's lettuce, Vene Cress , persimmon wedges, pomegranate seeds, and finally, sprinkle the salad with Pecorino flakes. Serve the persimmon and pomegranate salad with the mustard sauce .
The persimmon and pomegranate salad should be consumed immediately, and any type of storage is not recommended.
As an alternative to Vene Cress, you can use classic cress, arugula, or chicory if you prefer stronger flavors, or simple lettuce if you prefer a more delicate taste. Those who do not like mustard can dress the salad with balsamic vinegar.
Vene Cress is a type of cress distinguished by its unique tangy flavor. Its small green leaves are characterized by a red vein, a touch of color that makes dishes more appealing!
