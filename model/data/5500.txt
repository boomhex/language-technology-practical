Overnight porridge can be stored in the refrigerator for one night, after which it is recommended to consume it.
Oat bran has a finer texture compared to oat flakes: the former is more suitable for this preparation method, while the latter is more recommended for the cooked version of porridge.
We chose rice milk because it is naturally sweet and is therefore ideal for preparing porridge without added sugars. However, if you prefer, you can use cow's milk or another type of plant milk.
If you wish to sweeten the porridge, you can add white or brown sugar, stevia, honey, or maple or agave syrup.
