To prepare the classic pastries with artichokes and shrimp, start by cleaning the artichokes. For detailed instructions, see our How to clean artichokes . If you're not preparing the artichokes immediately, to prevent them from browning, place them in a bowl with cold water and lemon juice after cleaning. Cut off the tough, spiny tips of the artichokes. Proceed by removing the tougher outer leaves , continuing until only the tender ones remain. Remove the bottom part of the stem. From the remaining stem, remove any present spines, then use a paring knife to remove the outer fibrous layer so that only the tender part remains. Finally, remove the "choke" (the internal fuzzy part). At this point, quarter the artichoke .
Then finely slice them into julienne . Heat two tablespoons of oil with a whole garlic clove in a pan . Add the artichokes and cook for about 15 minutes, adding water if they dry out too much during cooking.
When cooking is almost complete, add the shrimp , cook for a few minutes, season with salt and pepper, turn off the heat, remove the garlic clove that has flavored the preparation, and grate the lemon . Now your artichokes with shrimp are ready .
Assemble the finger food: take a classic pastry, place the artichokes on top using kitchen tongs (or simply a teaspoon) and garnish with a couple of shrimp for each pastry , continue this way with all the pastries. Season the classic pastry with artichokes and shrimp with grated lemon zest and serve on the table.
It is recommended to consume the classic pastry with artichokes and shrimp immediately. Freezing is not recommended.
If you love the taste of artichokes but prefer a creamier texture, you can cook the artichokes longer and then blend them with a little broth to obtain a thick spreadable cream.
