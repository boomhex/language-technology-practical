instructions:
Start preparing the lemon curd by grating the zest of 3 lemons and squeezing and straining the juice , then incorporate the sifted cornstarch .
Cut the butter into pieces , place it in a double-bottomed saucepan for a bain-marie, and melt it over low heat, then add the sugar and stir with a spoon. Separately, beat the eggs with a whisk .
Pour them into the cream while continuing to mix, also add the lemon juice in which you have dissolved the cornstarch , the grated lemon zest , and continue stirring, thickening the cream over low heat. Keep the heat very low and let the bain-marie water only simmer, to prevent the egg from clumping; the cream must never boil.
To know when the cream is ready, just dip a wooden spoon into it ; when you see that the cream no longer slides off, it is time to turn off the heat. Now take a very fine-mesh sieve and strain the cream to remove the lemon peel and any lumps , your lemon curd is ready to fill your desserts.
You can store the lemon curd in the refrigerator for a few days covered with cling film in contact. It is possible to freeze the cream and then thaw it in the refrigerator.
You can vary the type of citrus fruits, for example, you can use oranges or mandarins, or use both together.
