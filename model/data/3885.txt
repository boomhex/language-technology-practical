instructions:
To prepare the sesame shrimp toast, start by removing the crust from the sandwich bread . Chop the shrimp , place them in a bowl, and add the cornstarch .
Mix and set aside . Then whip an egg white until stiff and pour it into the bowl with the shrimp .


Mix to blend the cream . Spread a generous layer of the shrimp mixture on each slice of bread . Place a shrimp in the center .
Cover with sesame seeds so they adhere well to the cream. Heat the seed oil in the wok , then immerse the toasts . It's preferable that they fry first "face down" and then on the other side. When the toasts are golden on both sides, drain them .
Transfer them to a tray lined with absorbent paper . Cut each slice diagonally to obtain two triangles . Your shrimp toast is ready to be served .
We recommend consuming the sesame shrimp toast immediately.
Want to make the shrimp cream more aromatic? Add some scallion or a teaspoon of grated ginger.
