instructions:
To prepare baked squid, start with How to clean squid . Rinse them under running water, then separate the head from the mantle . Remove the quill, the small cartilage rod inside the mantle. Take the head and remove the eyes, entrails, and beak found in the center of the tentacles. Remove the skin from the mantle and tentacles and rinse again under running water. Cut the mantle into rings and the tentacles into pieces .
In a bowl, place the breadcrumbs, add the panko , parsley , and mix everything together .
In another bowl, beat the eggs , then coat the squid first in the egg and then in the breadcrumb mixture .
Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese , and drizzle with oil . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 20 minutes, then in grill mode for an additional 5 minutes. The baked squid is ready to be enjoyed . If you like, you can season them with salt to taste after cooking.
Baked squid should be consumed immediately; however, if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 1-2 days.
You can add the aromatic herbs you like or have available to the breadcrumb mixture, such as thyme, marjoram, or rosemary. For a touch of freshness, add grated lemon zest to the mixture. If you love spicy flavors, try adding a pinch of sweet or smoked paprika, or a touch of chili powder to the mixture.
