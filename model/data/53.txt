instructions:
To prepare the roast sauce, first make the Beef Broth and keep it warm. Peel the onions and cut them into wedges . Peel the carrots .
Cut the carrots into chunks and do the same with the potatoes and celery .
In a saucepan, heat a drizzle of oil and add the vegetables . Stir and let everything brown over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Deglaze with the red wine .
Let it evaporate completely , then pour in the meat broth and the tomato paste .
Cook on low heat for an hour. Once ready, blend everything with an immersion blender until smooth and creamy; allow to thicken for another 10 minutes over low heat, stirring occasionally . Your roast sauce is ready to be served !
The roast sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days. You can freeze it for about a month.
If you prefer to use this sauce to accompany vegetarian dishes, simply replace the meat broth with Vegetable broth ! You can use white wine instead of red wine, but be aware that the sauce will have a different color.
