instructions:
To prepare the plin stuffed with Neapolitan ragù, start with the ragù: peel and finely slice the onions . Place the onions in a pan, add the oil , and turn on the heat. Stew the onions over low heat for about 20 minutes .
In the meantime, prepare the meat: cut the beef brisket, then chop the pork neck and shoulder into smaller pieces. You can leave the ribs whole. Salt the meat and brown it in a large pan with hot oil . Turn the meat pieces on all sides so that a nice crust forms . If the pan is not large enough, you can remove the toasted meat to make room for the remaining pieces , and then add them back later.
Meanwhile, the onions will be well softened , so pour them into the pan with the meat . Sauté everything for a few minutes to blend the flavors, then deglaze with red wine .
Let the wine reduce by about half, it shouldn't evaporate completely . At this point, add the tomato paste and the tomato purée .
Salt and let the ragù cook over low heat for about 3 hours . After this time, remove the meat from the sauce .
Debone and shred the meat with your hands , then put it back in the pan with the sauce and continue cooking for another 3 hours over medium-low heat. During cooking, you can brush the edges with a little water to remove the crust that tends to form .
In the meantime, you can work on the fresh pasta: arrange the flour in a well on the work surface, then pour the yolks in the center . Add salt and oil and start incorporating the ingredients with your hands .
Continue to work the mixture until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough . Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for about an hour, an hour and a half.
Once the ragù cooking time has elapsed, transfer it to a meat grinder and pass it through twice (alternatively, you can use a blender at low speed). Set aside about half of the ragù to use for dressing the plin, and put the rest in a bowl. Add the julienned basil .
Also add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano and mix well to obtain a homogeneous mixture . Transfer it to a piping bag and set aside.
Take the fresh pasta dough out of the refrigerator and divide it into smaller portions . Roll out one portion at a time, making sure to keep the rest covered. Dust the dough with a little flour and pass it through the pasta machine starting from the widest setting .
Fold the sheet to strengthen it and pass it through the machine again, gradually reducing the thickness until you reach the thinnest setting . Place the sheet on the work surface and squeeze the filling along its entire length .
Slightly dampen the sheet and fold it to cover the filling , then press well to adhere and remove the air .
Pinch the sheet at the sides of the filling to form the plin , then cut them with a fluted wheel first along the length and then to separate each one . Continue this way until all the dough is used up.
Now bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the plin for a couple of minutes . Drain the ravioli directly onto the napkin you have placed on a warm plate . Serve your plin stuffed with Neapolitan ragù with the reserved ragù or with a sauce based on cream and Parmesan !
The cooked plin stuffed with Neapolitan ragù can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
The fresh pasta and filling can be stored separately in the refrigerator for one day.
You can freeze them raw if you have used fresh ingredients, then cook them directly from frozen.
Don't have enough time to "simmer" the Neapolitan ragù? If you prefer, you can cook it for an hour and a half in a pressure cooker... but don't tell the purists!
