instructions:
To prepare the high hydration focaccia, start by sifting the flour to aerate it, add about 9.5 oz of water (the hydration is at 80%) and quickly knead with your hands . Don't worry if the dough isn't smooth; you’ll need to work the mixture until the water is absorbed, resulting in a rough and sticky dough.
Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for an hour at room temperature. After this time, the gluten will have developed, and the dough will be elastic. Now pour the remaining water into a small bowl, add the crumbled fresh yeast , and stir well to dissolve it .
Start working the dough with an electric mixer fitted with hooks at medium speed. Add a tiny amount of the water in which you dissolved the yeast and continue working until it is absorbed . Proceed in this way, adding just a little at a time , almost drop by drop.
When you have finished the water and the dough is well incorporated, add the salt and continue mixing until it is fully absorbed . Finally, add the oil in a thin stream . This phase of incorporating the ingredients takes about 10 to 15 minutes.
Once you finish the dough , detach it from the sides of the bowl and gather it in the center .
Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes . During this time, the dough will relax and become smoother. Then, give a turn of folds inside the bowl by lifting the dough and flipping it forward , with slightly dampened hands.
Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 40 minutes. Then give it another turn of folds, as done before . Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in the fridge for 12 hours or at room temperature for about two and a half hours.
The dough should rise until it triples in volume . At this point, grease a 15x10 inch baking pan, preferably dark, which conducts heat better, and sprinkle with cornmeal. Flip the dough onto a work surface sprinkled with cornmeal .
Stretch it with your fingertips until it lengthens, trying to get a size similar to the pan. Lift it and transfer it onto the baking pan .
Spread the dough to cover the entire surface . Add a little more oil on top and the salt flakes .
At this point , bake in a preheated fan oven at 390°F for 35-40 minutes. Once it is well browned, take it out and let it cool on a rack before serving .
We recommend consuming the focaccia right after it’s made. Alternatively, it can be stored in a paper bag for one day. Once cooled, it can be frozen, whole or in pieces.
Can't cover the entire pan size? The dough may be too stressed, cover it with a cloth, wait about ten minutes, and stretch it again!
Instead of cornmeal, you can use semolina!
