instructions:
To prepare the zucchini caviar with gorgonzola cream, start by coarsely cutting the gorgonzola . Transfer it to a blender with the cream cheese and season with salt and pepper.
Blend until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream , then proceed with preparing the caviar: cut the zucchini into thin slices and chop the shallot .
In a non-stick pan, heat the oil and add the shallot . Let it gently stew for 5 minutes, then add the zucchini and thyme .
Season with salt and pepper and continue to cook gently for at least 10 minutes. Then turn off the heat and let it cool. Then transfer the cooked zucchini to the blender and blend them coarsely .
Transfer the zucchini caviar obtained in this way into a bowl and fragrance it with basil . At this point, place the gorgonzola cream and the zucchini caviar separately in 2 piping bags .
Fill the glasses halfway with about 2 oz of zucchini caviar and then another quarter with about 1 oz of gorgonzola cream . Garnish the glasses with thyme, basil, and cherry tomatoes: your zucchini caviar with gorgonzola cream is ready to be served !
The glasses of zucchini caviar with gorgonzola cream can be stored in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for a maximum of 2 days.
You can fragrance your zucchini caviar using, in addition to thyme and basil, the aromatic herbs you prefer: a touch of marjoram will make the taste even more unique, or a few mint leaves will give it a fresh and slightly balsamic scent!
