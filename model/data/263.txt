Add the vanilla extract , baking powder, and rice flour . Mix until you get a homogeneous batter .
Scoop enough batter to fill one compartment of the waffle iron . Close and cook for about 2-3 minutes . Continue this way to cook all the waffles; with these amounts, you should get 7 .
Plate them and garnish with banana slices and maple syrup . Banana waffles are ready to be enjoyed !
It's recommended to consume the banana waffles immediately. If there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator for 1-2 days, in an airtight container. Before enjoying them again, warm them in the oven at 320°F for 5 minutes or in a non-stick pan for a few moments.
Alternatively, you can freeze them: arrange them on a tray, let them cool completely, and then transfer them to food bags. When needed, just warm them directly in the oven.
To make the waffles even more delicious, you can add chocolate chips to the batter or a teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa. Alternatively, you can flavor it with cinnamon or grated lemon zest.
