instructions:
To prepare your gluten-free and lactose-free roll, start by beating the egg whites with sugar until you obtain a fluffy and glossy mass, firm under the beaters . When the mixture is stable, gently fold in the yolks, incorporating them from bottom to top to avoid deflating the mixture . Then add the sifted gluten-free flour mix, little by little, until the batter is smooth .
Finally, pour in the vegetable oil and mix it in with slow, circular movements, maintaining the soft structure of the mixture . At this point, prepare the baking sheet lined with parchment paper and spread the batter with a spatula .
Level it evenly . Bake in a static oven at 375°F for about 17 minutes, until the surface turns a light golden brown . Once ready, immediately flip it onto a sheet of parchment paper and remove the baking paper.
Let the sponge cake cool slightly . Meanwhile, focus on the cream: in a bowl, work the ricotta with the mascarpone until you get a smooth and homogeneous consistency. Add the powdered sugar and mix again . Place 1/3 of the cream in a piping bag for the final decoration.
Incorporate the chocolate chips, distributing them evenly . Take the now warm base and spread the cream over it in a thick and even layer . Place the raspberries on top, allowing them to sink slightly into the cream .
Start rolling the dessert, then transfer it onto a sheet of plastic wrap . Wrap it completely in the plastic wrap to stabilize its shape and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 1–2 hours. Once firm, transfer it to a serving plate and decorate the surface with dollops of leftover cream .
Add raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries, alternating them for an elegant and scenic effect . To finish, dust a light layer of powdered sugar . The gluten-free and lactose-free roll is ready to be served .
The gluten-free and lactose-free Christmas roll can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
We recommend adding the decoration just before serving.
If you prefer a lighter cream, use only lactose-free ricotta or add a layer of red fruit jam to intensify the flavor and make the roll even more delicious.
