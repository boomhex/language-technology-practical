To prepare the Neapolitan cartridges, first place the powdered sugar , almonds , and water in the bowl of a food processor with blades.
Blend everything until you get a cream and transfer it to a small bowl . In another bowl, add the room-temperature butter ,
the sugar , and the bitter almond essence . Work everything with an electric mixer for a few minutes until the butter is whipped.
At this point, add the almond cream prepared earlier and work again with the mixer until you get a uniform mixture. Then add the whole egg
and turn the mixer back on to let it absorb . Finally, add the flour all at once and work first at low speed and then slightly increase it .
Once you have obtained a well-whipped, smooth, and homogeneous mixture , transfer it into a pastry bag without a nozzle . Then place the metal cylinders with a diameter of approximately 1 inch and a length of 1.75 inches on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and get the typical baking papers .
Roll them and insert one into each cylinder . Fill them with the mixture up to the edge of the metal cylinders (20-21). With these doses, you will get about 16 cartridges. Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes, on the middle shelf.
When they are golden brown on the surface, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly . Then gently remove the cartridges from the metal cylinders (with all the paper) and transfer them to a tray . The Neapolitan cartridges are ready to serve .
Store the Neapolitan cartridges in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Once baked and cooled, removed from the molds, they can be frozen.
Instead of almonds, you can use the same amount of almond flour.
If you can't find the specific papers, you can use white tissue paper for food.
