Add a ladle of hot broth at a time and cook the rice until it's al dente, about 14 minutes, but follow the package instructions. In the meantime, prepare the sausage by removing the casing and breaking it into small pieces . In a non-stick pan, pour the oil and add the garlic .
Add the sausage and brown it for 10 minutes . When the rice is al dente, add the sausage , without the fat released during cooking.
Combine the butter and grated Parmesan cheese . Cover with a lid and let it rest for 2 minutes.
Cream it and plate it . Your red wine and sausage risotto is ready to be enjoyed .
The red wine and sausage risotto should be consumed as soon as it's ready, but if there are leftovers, you can store it in the refrigerator in a closed container for up to 1 day.
For a more intense flavor, you can use beef broth instead of vegetable broth. You can enrich the risotto by adding porcini or champignon mushrooms. If you like it spicy, you can add a fresh chili pepper along with the shallot. If you prefer a milder taste, try replacing the red wine with a dry white wine.
