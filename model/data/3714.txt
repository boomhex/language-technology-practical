instructions:
To prepare the fried sage in batter, wash the sage leaves thoroughly under plenty of cold running water , then let them dry on a tray lined with kitchen paper towels . Pour the flour into a bowl and add the cold beer a little at a time, stirring with a whisk ;
continue to stir until you obtain a smooth batter without lumps , then season with salt to your liking . Once ready, dip the sage leaves one by one into the batter you have prepared ,
turning them on both sides until they are completely covered . Heat the seed oil on the stove, checking that it reaches a temperature of 340°F with the help of a kitchen thermometer. At this point, fry the sage leaves a few pieces at a time :
when the leaves are golden brown, remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon and place them to drain on kitchen paper towels . Adjust the salt and serve the fried sage leaves in batter immediately .
It is recommended to consume the fried sage leaves in batter while they are hot.
The batter can also be prepared with sparkling water instead of beer; however, the latter, containing yeasts, will help the batter puff up during frying, making it even more appetizing!
