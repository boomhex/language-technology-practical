Pasta ai moscardini e pesto, a classic from Liguria , really brings the delicate taste of baby octopus together with the bold flavors of seafood pasta . It’s like bringing a piece of Genoa right to your table. Especially when you pair it with trofie—the twisty pasta that’s just perfect for pesto. So so good! What really makes this dish pop is the moist texture of the octopus mixed with the fresh, herby aroma of basil pesto. You can throw in a hint of mint or even some crushed walnuts for extra crunch, keeping each bite interesting. Honestly, it's one of those easy seafood recipes that feels like a summer day by the sea, though you can enjoy it any time of year. You get a little bit of everything: tender bites of octopus, sweet basil, and that Ligurian blend of land and sea. And look, Pasta ai moscardini e pesto is just perfect for gathering friends around the table, whether you serve it warm or chilled.
Its versatility is what makes it so awesome, fitting into any meal setting. Imagine this: a casual lunch with crusty bread or as part of a larger dinner spread with other Italian pasta recipes . Either way, it stands out, especially with a drizzle of good olive oil and a sprinkle of walnuts on top. The blend of shrimp pesto pasta and ocean flavors is seriously something crispy and a little tangy, all at once. And you know, because it’s so quick and simple to prepare, it’s a favorite for anyone who loves quick pasta dishes or is looking for reliable weeknight dinner ideas . Even those who don’t usually go for seafood get drawn in by the pesto’s golden aroma. It brings everything together, no question. This classic Ligurian style—simple, moist, and always fresh—makes it a go-to whenever you want to bring a touch of sea air and sunshine to your table.
To prepare pasta with baby octopus and pesto, start with the pesto (if you don't already have homemade pesto available). To see the complete procedure, you can click on the cooking school card here: Genoese pesto (Pesto alla genovese) . In a mortar (or you can use a mixer if you don't have one), crush the garlic clove into a paste. Then add the basil leaves with a pinch of coarse salt. Crush the basil leaves against the walls of the mortar with the pestle, turning the pestle from left to right and simultaneously turning the mortar in the opposite direction . When the bright green liquid comes out from the leaves, add the pine nuts and continue grinding. Then gradually add the cheeses and continue mixing along with the extra virgin olive oil . Blend the ingredients. Now that the pesto is ready, set it aside.
Now proceed to clean the baby octopus: wash them under running water. Then on a cutting board, one by one, separate the head from the tentacles by cutting with a knife just below the eyes to remove them . Again with the knife, remove the central tooth and set the tentacles aside . Make a small incision on the head to remove the innards .
Then gently peel the skin off the head with your hands and then also remove the skin from the tentacles with your hands . Split the tentacles in half to facilitate cooking .
Rinse the cleaned parts of the baby octopus, head, and tentacles, under running water, then drain them . In a pan, heat the oil with the garlic clove . Then add the baby octopus and sauté for a few seconds, stirring frequently.
Add the white wine . Cook for about 10 minutes, then take the pesto that you had set aside and dilute it with a bit of hot water. Add it directly to the pan and let the ingredients blend by mixing them together. If necessary, you can add a little more hot water so that the sauce doesn't dry out too much. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil, salt it to taste, and bring it to a boil. When the water boils, add the trofie (or another type of pasta will also work) and cook until al dente.
Then drain the trofie and add them to the pan with the baby octopus and pesto to flavor the pasta and sauté for a few seconds, adjusting salt and pepper to your liking . Serve the pasta with baby octopus and pesto, adding some fresh basil or mint leaves to the plates if you prefer !
The pasta with baby octopus and pesto, once cooked, can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. The pesto can be stored in the fridge for 2-3 days in a sealed jar, making sure to cover it with a layer of olive oil. It can be stored in the freezer in an airtight jar.
If you come across some super juicy cherry tomatoes and just don't know what to do with them, use them to flavor the sauce! Add them to the pan before sautéing the baby octopus. While you're at it, why not also add some Gaeta olives after cooking the baby octopus?
