instructions:
To prepare the quick savory doughnuts, first start by making the dough. In a bowl, combine the flour with the salt and instant yeast ; add the oil and water at room temperature .
Start working everything with your hands until you get a homogeneous mixture , then transfer it to a work surface and knead until smooth . Cover with a cloth and let it rest for about 10 minutes .
Meanwhile, dice the fontina cheese . Then peel the carrot and, using a peeler, create thin slices . Do the same for the zucchini, but this time do not peel them .
Take the dough and divide it into 4 portions of 3.5 oz each . Then roll each piece to get an oval about 1/8 inch thick. Place some ham and zucchini slices ,
carrot slices and fontina cubes . Gently lift the part in front of you
and roll it up . Then join the two outer ends to form a small doughnut and press with your fingers to seal them .
Place the doughnuts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush the surface with some fresh cream . Then bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for about 25 minutes in the middle rack. Once they are nicely golden, take them out and enjoy them while hot!
The quick savory doughnuts, once baked, can be stored in the fridge for up to a couple of days. Just heat them up before serving. If you wish, you can freeze the doughnuts after baking; when it's time to serve, let them sit at room temperature for a couple of hours and then reheat them in the oven.
If you prefer a vegetarian version, omit the cooked ham and increase the amount of cheese!
