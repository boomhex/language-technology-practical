instructions:
To prepare the veggie hot dogs, put the beans , lentils into a food processor, and add the soy sauce .
Add the tomato paste , ground ginger , and paprika .
Continue by adding yellow curry, chili powder, mustard , and salt . Blend for a short time, just a few pulses, to obtain a coarsely chopped mixture .
Then transfer it to a bowl, add the gluten , and knead. The dough should be homogeneous and elastic . To help you, you can knead with wet hands, which will also help regulate the hydration of the mixture. Cut it into 4 parts of about 3.5 oz (100 g) each .
Shape the dough pieces into small loaves about 8 inches (20 cm) long . Wrap them in clean natural fiber cloths and tie the ends with string like a candy . Boil in a broth of water and soy sauce for 30 minutes .
Once cooked, drain and untie them , and place them in a pan with a little oil. Brown them for about 8 minutes, turning often to brown all sides . Cut the buns in half and toast them .
Assemble the sandwiches by placing vegan mayonnaise and lettuce on the bottom . Add the sausage and sliced tomatoes .
Add red onions , a sprinkle of lime zest , and pepper. Your veggie hot dogs are ready to be enjoyed .
You can store the veggie hot dogs in the refrigerator in a closed container for 2-3 days.
If you prefer a gluten-free version, you can use alternative flours like chickpea or rice flour instead of wheat gluten. You can use different spices for the filling such as cumin, turmeric, smoked pepper, coriander, or parsley. For the sandwich topping, you can use: hummus, guacamole, vegan barbecue sauce, Dijon mustard. For a more hearty and colorful version, you can add: grilled vegetables, caramelized onions, roasted peppers, or zucchini.
