Start preparing the peach crumble with the crumble dough: place the two flours (white and almond) in a bowl, add the brown sugar , cinnamon, butter (cold from the refrigerator and cut into cubes), and egg yolk . Briefly work them with a wooden spoon, so as not to mix them completely but to leave them well crumbled, obtaining dough crumbs. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes in the refrigerator and then transfer the crumble onto a baking sheet covered with a sheet of parchment paper, trying to space out the dough . Bake it in a fan oven at 356°F until the crumble is golden brown (this will take about 15/20 minutes).
In the meantime, peel the peaches and cut them into cubes , then place them in a pan where you have melted the butter , add the granulated sugar and the vanilla seeds.
Sauté the peaches and deglaze with the beer , letting it evaporate. Then let the fruit cool. In another small pot, place the well-washed strawberries cut into quarters and cook them for 2-3 minutes with the lemon juice and brown sugar. Then compose the peach crumble using individual serving glasses: lay the strawberries at the bottom, add the peach compote, and finally the crunchy crumble dough . Serve the peach crumble cold!
