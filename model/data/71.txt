To prepare the ciaramicola, start by placing the butter in a bowl, grating the orange zest and melting it in the microwave, or in a small saucepan over low heat. Set the melted butter aside . Meanwhile, in a bowl, pour the eggs and sugar .
Beat with an electric whisk for about ten minutes . When the mixture is fluffy, gradually pour in the cooled butter and then the alchermes , keeping the whisk running.
Finally, turn off the whisk and sift the flour and baking powder into the bowl . Turn the whisk back on to incorporate the dry ingredients . At this point, if the mixture appears not red enough, you can add some gel coloring until you obtain the desired color .
Mix well , then pour the batter into a greased and floured bundt pan, measuring 10 inches on the surface and 8.5 inches at the base . Level carefully and bake in a static oven at 350°F for about 50 minutes, performing the toothpick test. Once cooked, remove from the oven and let it cool in the pan .
Meanwhile, prepare the meringue: pour the room-temperature egg whites into the stand mixer's bowl together with half of the powdered sugar . Whisk for 5 minutes at medium speed .
At this point, add the remaining half of the powdered sugar and beat for another 5 minutes or until the whisk forms the so-called bird's peak . Once the meringue is ready, spread it over the surface of the bundt cake with the help of a spoon .
Carefully garnish and sprinkle with colorful sprinkles . Finally, place the bundt cake back in a preheated static oven at 200°F for about 40 minutes or until the meringue is dry. Your ciaramicola is ready, and once cooled, it will be ready to be enjoyed !
The ciaramicola can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
Alchermes is a distinctive ingredient of ciaramicola because it adds color and fragrance to the dough; we enhanced the shade by adding liquid food coloring, but you can omit it if you prefer.
If you have liposoluble food coloring, melt it in the butter instead of adding it directly to the dough.
The meringue will pasteurize in the oven, so you can consume it with peace of mind.
The oldest version of ciaramicola was very different from the soft and meringue-topped one we know today. Originally, it seems to have been a sort of sweet flatbread, less leavened and more rustic, with a dough enriched with sugar and alchermes, but without the meringue topping. This original version was probably closer to the sweet holiday breads found in many Italian regions.
The dough was made with simple ingredients such as flour, eggs, and lard, and it was baked in shapes different from the bundt cake and tied to specific symbolism: - in the shape of a Crown, like that of Christ; - like a cross; - a circle with 5 balls placed at points other than the center to remember the 5 Gates of the city of Perugia.
Only later, with the influence of more refined pastry, did the ciaramicola transform into the soft and decorated cake that today represents Easter in Umbria.
