instructions:
To prepare the lactose-free pear and chocolate cake, first peel all the pears , then cut those for the batter into cubes and those for the topping into thin wedges .
Chop the dark chocolate with a knife . In a bowl, place the eggs and sugar , then beat with an electric mixer .
When you have obtained a light and fluffy mixture, gradually add the vegetable oil and soy milk , keeping the mixer running. In a separate bowl, sift the flour and baking powder .
Sift the cocoa powder as well , then add the dry ingredients one tablespoon at a time while mixing with the mixer . Continue to work until the dry ingredients are completely absorbed .
At this point, add the chopped chocolate and the pear cubes and gently mix with a spatula to incorporate them evenly .
Pour the obtained batter into an 8.5-inch diameter mold lined with parchment paper . Level the surface and decorate with pear wedges , arranging them in a radial pattern . Bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for about 50 minutes. Check the doneness with a toothpick before removing from the oven and let it cool.
In the meantime, melt the chocolate for decoration in the microwave (or in a bain-marie). Once cooled, garnish the surface of the cake with the melted chocolate . Your lactose-free pear and chocolate cake is ready to be enjoyed !
The lactose-free pear and chocolate cake can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
You can freeze it after baking.
You can use any variety of pears you prefer, such as coscia, williams, kaiser, or abate pears.
If you prefer, you can replace the soy milk with unsweetened rice or oat milk.
