To prepare the sole rolls with herbs, the first thing to do is prepare the breading. Transfer the breadcrumbs into a bowl, add the crushed garlic , the chopped parsley , salt, pepper, and the chopped basil .
Mix everything and set aside . Cut the sole fillets in half lengthwise . Spread a little bread mixture on each fillet ,
and drizzle with a little oil . Then roll up the sole fillets and secure them with a toothpick .
Repeat this operation for all the fillets . Break the eggs into a plate, add the milk , salt, pepper, and beat everything .
Dip the rolls first in the egg and then in the breadcrumb mixture , placing them on a plate as you go .
Melt the butter in a pan, place the sole rolls inside , and cook for 3-5 minutes, turning the rolls halfway through cooking . In the meantime, prepare the sauce. Transfer the mayonnaise to a bowl ,
add the yogurt and mix . Finally, add the desalted capers , mix again, and serve the sauce together with the sole rolls, now cooked .
The sole rolls can be stored cooked in the refrigerator for a maximum of 1-2 days.
