instructions:
To prepare the waffle batter, start by placing the 2 eggs in a large bowl , mix with a wooden spoon, then add the milk and the melted butter .
Mix well, and then while stirring, add the sugar . Next, incorporate the flour, yeast, and salt by sifting them with a sieve . Mix the ingredients well , add the vanilla bean seeds, cover the batter with plastic wrap, and let it rest in the refrigerator for about half an hour.
Heat the waffle iron to the highest temperature and brush it well with melted butter to prevent the batter from sticking. Pour a ladleful of batter and spread it well inside the waffle iron with the help of a spoon (our waffle iron has a diameter of 6.3 inches). At this point, close the waffle iron and follow the machine's instructions for the cooking mode. Let the waffle cook for about 3-4 minutes until it has colored and cooked inside . The waffle should be slightly crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Garnish the waffles with a dusting of powdered sugar and serve them hot, accompanied as you prefer (red fruits, chocolate, whipped cream, cocoa, etc.).
There are many types of waffle irons available for cooking waffles. For optimal cooking of your waffles, read and follow the instructions of your machine carefully.
