instructions:
To prepare the Mars cake, line a 9.5-inch springform pan with parchment paper. Then cut the bars into pieces , then melt the butter over low heat in a wide pan or saucepan . Once melted, add the bars , slightly increase the heat
and stir everything with a spatula to melt the bars, it will take a few minutes . Once melted, you need to act rather quickly: remove promptly from the heat and pour into a bowl with the puffed rice , briefly mix everything to combine .
Transfer the mixture into the lined baking pan with parchment paper , spread the base well to cover the entire bottom, using the back of a spoon , and set aside for now (out of the fridge). Now chop the milk chocolate
and melt it in a double boiler , stirring occasionally to aid melting. Meanwhile, heat the cream in a small pot. Once the chocolate is melted, add the heated cream and stir for a few moments, then pour everything over the puffed rice base .
Spread evenly with a spatula and let your Mars cake set outside the fridge for about an hour . To remove it, simply open your springform pan and remove the parchment paper . Serve it in squares if you prefer!
Store the Mars cake under a glass dome for 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can also make the Mars cake in a rectangular pan if you prefer, making sure to choose a size that allows for a rice crispies base of at least a couple of inches. You can add salted peanuts to the base or the ganache before pouring it over the base.
