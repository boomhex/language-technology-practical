instructions:
To prepare the pasta with lettuce pesto and squid, start with the latter. We bought pre-cleaned squid, but if yours are not, you can follow our guide: how to clean squid. Score the mantle and open it like a book. Using a knife, first cut it into strips , then into small cubes .
Slice the shallot into thin rings and let them sauté in a pan with a drizzle of oil . As soon as it is well browned, add the squid cubes and sauté for a few moments.
Add the sweet paprika and cook for a couple more minutes. Then turn off the heat and add the sprigs of wild fennel . Set the squid aside and prepare the lettuce pesto. Wash, dry, and cut the lettuce into pieces, then transfer it into a blender cup .
Then pour in the oil and season with salt. Blend everything with an immersion blender until you obtain a smooth cream. Then transfer the lettuce pesto to a small bowl and cover it with cling film .
Cook the pasta in abundant salted boiling water and drain it al dente, transferring it directly into a pan. Add the lettuce pesto, a ladle of cooking water , and toss everything together. Then add half of the squid ragù and mix again.
Transfer the pasta onto plates and add some squid ragù on each . Garnish with crumbled taralli and serve your pasta with lettuce pesto and squid .
Store the pasta in the refrigerator and enjoy it within a couple of days. Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of romaine lettuce, you can use another type of salad: curly, trocadero, or baby lettuce.
