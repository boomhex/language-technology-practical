With every slice, this asparagus quiche checks all the boxes for adaptable, satisfying family food—and home cooks keep coming back for its crowd-pleasing look and taste.
To prepare the salmon quiche with asparagus and leeks, start by cleaning the asparagus, removing the hard end of the stem, and using a peeler to remove the toughest filaments of the stem. Then boil the asparagus in a tall pot with salted boiling water , keeping the tips out of the water. While the asparagus is cooking, prepare the Béchamel sauce : make the roux with butter and flour, then add the hot milk and mix everything, season with salt and add nutmeg . Once the asparagus is cooked, cut the stems into slices, keeping the tips whole ,
Take the salmon and cut it into fairly large strips . Then melt the oil and butter, then add the leeks, which you will have previously cleaned and finely sliced (only the white part), and let them soften gently without coloring. When the leeks are well softened, add the sliced asparagus to the pan (keeping the tips aside) and let them flavor for a few minutes.
Add the chopped salmon ; add the cream , mix, and after a minute also add the bechamel sauce , let it cook for 5 minutes.
Mix well, then adjust the salt and pepper and turn off the heat . Prepare the Easy Shortcrust Pastry by placing cold butter and flour in a mixer, then transfer to a work surface, add water and knead everything. Then butter a low quiche dish with a diameter of 10 inches and place the shortcrust pastry, then prick the dough with a fork
and pour the previously obtained mixture inside . Use a pastry cutter to remove the excess dough and fold the edges of the quiche towards the inside of the dish (15-16)
At this point, focus on decoration: use a leaf-shaped or any other shaped pastry cutter to cut out leaves from the leftover shortcrust pastry . Arrange the asparagus tips in the center of the quiche to form a flower, and place the cut-out shapes on the surface, creating the decoration you like best .
Then beat the milk with an egg yolk and brush the shortcrust pastry to make it shiny and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F for 25-30 minutes (340°F for 20 minutes in a fan oven), until the shortcrust pastry is golden and crispy . Remove the quiche, let it rest for 5 minutes, and then cut and serve it hot or warm.
You can store the quiche in the refrigerator inside an airtight container. The salmon quiche with asparagus and leeks can also be frozen, perhaps already sliced, so you can defrost and serve only the portions you need.
If you want to make your salmon quiche even richer, you can add some shrimp to the filling and on the surface of this delicious dish, along with a pinch of chopped parsley or chives.
