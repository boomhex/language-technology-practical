instructions:
To prepare the autumn rice salad, first, put a pot full of salted water on the stove, which will be used to cook the rice. While it comes to a boil, take the pumpkin, remove the seeds inside , and peel it . First, cut it into slices and then into cubes of about 0.4 inches .
In a pan, pour a drizzle of oil, add the pumpkin , and add 3-4 sage leaves . Season with salt and sauté over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes until it is soft and well-browned.
At this point, cook the rice according to the times indicated on the package . Wash the red cabbage well and cut it into thin strips first one way and then the other to get small squares. Drain the rice al dente and transfer it to a bowl; season with oil .
Mix and let it cool slightly . Then add the pumpkin cubes and the cabbage .
Mix again . Rinse the Borlotti beans, drain them, and pour them into the bowl . Also, add the Quartirolo cheese, crumbling it roughly with your hands , and pepper to taste.
