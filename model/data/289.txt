instructions:
To prepare sgabei, first put the yeast in a pitcher , add warm water, and dissolve it . In a bowl, place the flour and pour in all the water .
Add the oil and start mixing with a spoon. Add the salt , then move to a work surface and knead until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough ball .
Transfer it to a floured bowl and let it rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a dry, draft-free place for 3 hours or until it doubles . Take the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin until it forms a sheet 3/8 inch thick .
Use a pastry cutter to trim the edges , then divide the rectangle into strips 6 inches long and about 1 inch wide . You will get about 16 pieces. Cover with a clean cloth and let rise for 1 hour in a dry, draft-free place. Heat the peanut oil to a temperature of 340-350°F and fry 2-3 sgabei at a time to avoid lowering the oil temperature too much.
Cook for 2 minutes per side . Once they are nicely golden , place them on paper towels to remove excess oil. Season with a bit of salt and your sgabei are ready to be served .
Sgabei should be consumed as soon as they are ready. The dough or raw sgabei can be frozen for 3 months.
You can replace fresh yeast with 3-4 g of dry yeast. For a more flavorful version, you can add chopped aromatic herbs like rosemary or thyme to the dough. If you prefer a sweet variant, once fried, you can sprinkle them with powdered sugar or serve them with honey and jams.
