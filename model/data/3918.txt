instructions:
To prepare quail eggs in a bread heart, start by removing the crusts from the sandwich bread with a knife , then take a heart-shaped cookie cutter and press it into the center of the sandwich bread slices , setting aside the bread that remains inside .
Carefully crack the quail eggs, placing the yolks in separate bowls and the whites aside . In a rather large pan, melt about 1 tbsp of butter and place the bread slices in the pan .
Let them brown on both sides without burning , then first place the egg white inside the slices using a teaspoon , followed by the yolk .
Salt to taste and let everything cook on low heat; in another pan, melt the remaining 2 tsp of butter and brown the small bread hearts on one side and the other . Then turn off the heat and serve the quail eggs in a bread heart on serving plates, accompanied, for example, by lamb's lettuce .
It is preferable to consume the quail eggs in a bread heart as soon as they are made!
To prepare this recipe, you must use very fresh eggs and butter; furthermore, if you don't like or can't find quail eggs, you can use small chicken eggs as a substitute.
Quail eggs can be used in the kitchen just like chicken eggs: sunny side up, in an omelet, soft-boiled, hard-boiled, for desserts or homemade pasta. Some studies have shown that they are also indicated for the prevention and treatment of some types of allergies.
