instructions:
To prepare the Greek yogurt cake, start by pouring the whole eggs into a large bowl . Add the sugar and beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer .
When it becomes fluffy, light, and frothy , add the Greek yogurt and mix it into the batter with the mixer .

Next, add a pinch of salt , vanilla extract , and oil .

Continuing to work the batter with the electric mixer , add the flour, making sure to sift it and pour it in little by little , then mix again until the batter is creamy, smooth, and uniform.


Now you just need to add the baking powder , always sifting it with a sieve, and mix one last time until you get the right consistency .

Then pour the batter into a 20 cm diameter pan, previously lined with parchment paper . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 40 minutes on the middle shelf. Times may vary slightly depending on the oven, always do the toothpick test . Once ready, allow the Greek yogurt cake to cool .
Unmold your Greek yogurt cake onto a plate , decorate it with powdered sugar , and enjoy it !

The Greek yogurt cake can be stored on a plate with a glass dome for 3 or 4 days at room temperature.

If you prefer a different aroma than vanilla, you can use lemon or orange zest.
The Greek yogurt cake can be decorated and filled with whipped cream and fresh fruit, or with custard.
