Mushroom soufflé —for real, it brings such comfort to autumn gatherings, especially when you throw in fresh porcini mushrooms and other forest goodies the season’s known for. And you know what, there’s just something about the way a mushroom soufflé puffs up in the oven. Light as air, with that cloud-like feel, every bite feels so inviting. In France, folks are really really serious about their soufflés, and you get why when you taste that soft, almost mousse-like center. Porcini mushrooms give it a strong, earthy kick, and when you slow-bake everything, the flavors get super aromatic. Honestly, it’s a fancy starter that doesn’t feel fussy, just pure comfort and a bit of celebration. Especially when the weather’s cool and everyone’s craving something warm and special.
The trick with this easy mushroom soufflé recipe is folding those fluffy egg whites just right. You end up with a texture that’s tender, never dense, and gets a nice lift every time you pull a spoonful from the ramekin. Pretty simple.
Across different parts of France and even in kitchens that love autumn’s wild harvest, people put their own spin on the savory mushroom soufflé . Some folks add Gruyère cheese for a nutty tang, while others mix in chestnuts or wild herbs—way better woodsy notes. That deep, moist center with the golden top is what everyone is after. A perfect balance that shows off what slow baking can do. And listen, this dish works just as well for a fancy dinner as it does for a casual get-together. Especially since a make-ahead mushroom soufflé means less stress when friends show up hungry.
Serve it with a side of wild fruit or roasted tubers, and it’s a meal that’s both rustic and classy. And the thing is, folks love how the vegetarian mushroom soufflé fits with so many fall flavors. The intense, savory smell when it comes out of the oven is honestly half the fun. It’s a simple pleasure that feels a little bit like a treat. Especially on those chilly nights when everyone’s looking for something extra cozy to start the meal. Seriously good.
To make the mushroom soufflé, start with the How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms : gently remove the soil from the stem with a small knife , then finish cleaning with a brush and a dry cloth. If necessary, you can quickly rinse the mushrooms under a stream of cold water (although it is always preferable not to wet them) and gently dry them with a soft cloth . Cut off the end of the stem .
The porcini are now ready: you can slice them , then dice them . In a pan, sauté the peeled and whole garlic with the oil for a few moments. Then add the porcini .
Salt (1g will be enough), add pepper , and let cook over low heat for about ten minutes. When the mushrooms are ready, remove the garlic clove with kitchen tongs and set aside. Meanwhile, prepare the soufflé mixture: in a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat, stirring with a whisk .
When it melts, add the flour while continuing to stir with the whisk to avoid forming lumps . Add the milk while continuing to stir , adjust the salt, and let it thicken over gentle heat .
When the ingredients are well mixed and the mixture is thick, add the egg yolks (set aside the egg whites that you will need later). You can add them a little at a time, two yolks together , stirring to incorporate them into the mixture, and then add the third . When the yolks are absorbed, transfer the mixture to a bowl and let it cool .
Once cool, add the cooked mushrooms to the mixture , add 3g of salt, mix the ingredients, and flavor with a few thyme leaves . Set aside the mixture. Then take 6 molds of 3.5 inches in diameter and 2.5 inches in height, line them on the outside with strips of parchment paper 3-3.5 inches thick so that they are taller than the edges and as long as the circumference of each container; secure them with string: this way, your soufflé will expand vertically when rising in the oven. Brush each mold with oil .
Then, beat the egg whites to very stiff peaks with an electric mixer and gently incorporate them into the mixture by stirring from top to bottom to avoid deflating them (20-21).
Place the molds on a baking sheet and pour the mixture inside using a small ladle or spoon , filling 2/3 of the molds . Then bake in a preheated static oven at 320°F for 45 minutes. Once ready, turn off the oven and wait 2-3 minutes before opening it. Then remove and serve your mushroom soufflés immediately!
The softness of soufflés is best enjoyed if served immediately.
It is therefore recommended to prepare the recipe on the spot.
Freezing is not recommended.

If you don't have much time before guests arrive for dinner, you can prepare the mushrooms and the batter. At the last minute, you can whip the egg whites, add them to the rest of the mixture, and cook the soufflés!
