First of all, begin by preparing the olive oil cake, so in a bowl sift the flour and the baking powder . In the bowl of a stand mixer already equipped with a whisk, pour in the room temperature eggs and add the sugar and a pinch of salt (if you don't have a stand mixer use an electric hand mixer). Turn on the stand mixer and let it work the mixture well, add the orange zest .
Then slowly pour in the olive oil and once it is well incorporated, add the room temperature condensed milk . Finally, add the sifted dry ingredients little by little so as to obtain a fluid and homogeneous mixture.
Grease and flour a 9-inch ring cake mold and pour in the mixture spreading it with a spatula ; it's important to level the batter carefully. Bake in a preheated oven at 340°F for 50 minutes. When the ring cake is cooked, let it cool slightly before removing it from the pan and then let it cool completely on a wire rack. Meanwhile, prepare the cream by soaking the gelatin sheets in a little cold water .
On a cutting board and with the help of a sharp knife, chop the chocolate and then let it melt in a double boiler , while in another small pot heat the milk .
As soon as the chocolate is melted, pour in the room temperature condensed milk and stir continuously. Don't worry if it thickens, by adding the hot milk and continuing to stir with a whisk, the mixture will blend well; then add the egg yolks and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes while still stirring.
Squeeze the gelatin sheets well and add them to the still-hot cream ; after mixing well to dissolve it completely and incorporating it, transfer the cream to a shallow bowl and cover with plastic wrap in contact with the surface : first let it cool at room temperature, then put it in the fridge for 2 hours. After this time, pour the cream into the stand mixer bowl and let the whisk work a bit to soften it .
Separately, whip the cream and gently fold it in from the bottom up , then pour the mixture into a pastry bag with a smooth tip. After cutting the ring cake in half , transfer it to a plate.
Fill the ring cake with the cream creating concentric circles, then reassemble the ring cake with the other half . With the leftover cream, prepare the glaze by mixing it with the coffee .
Finally, place the ring cake on the wire rack and put a plate underneath to catch the glaze that will drip when poured , decorate the cake by sprinkling it with chocolate shavings , and put it in the fridge for 30 minutes. Complete the Easter nest ring cake by decorating it with chocolate eggs covered in colored sugar.
The Easter nest ring cake, once ready and filled, can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days; if you prepare the cake the day before, it is advisable to prepare the cream the next day and fill it right before serving.
The Easter nest ring cake is always a hit among guests at the Easter lunch or during the Easter Monday picnic: its irresistible and distinctive sweetness makes it particularly delicious. You can surprise everyone with a touch of extra originality by flavoring the coffee with a little coffee liqueur, or by covering it with white chocolate shavings for an even more spectacular effect!
