For the preparation of Pavian soup, it is necessary to prepare some meat broth, at least one liter (about 4 cups). Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan, add the slices of bread, from which you have removed the dark crust, and toast them on both sides; then place one in each soup plate, or better yet, in an ovenproof dish. On each slice, crack an egg trying to keep the yolk intact, sprinkle with a couple of tablespoons of Grana Padano, then pour a ladle of hot broth. Put in an oven preheated to 300°F for 5 minutes, then serve the Pavian Soup piping hot.
