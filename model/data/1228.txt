instructions:
To make the lady's kisses with mortadella, first prepare the dough: pour the all-purpose flour into a bowl along with the almond flour and mix, then add the grated Grana Padano DOP cheese and the cold butter in cubes .
Add the salt and the white wine and work with your fingertips to incorporate the butter into the mixture .
Continue kneading on the work surface to obtain a compact and homogeneous dough . Divide the dough into 24 balls of about 0.7 oz each and roll them between the palms of your hands . Place the obtained balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them slightly apart from each other , and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes.
In the meantime, you can prepare the filling cream: put the mortadella into the mixer cup along with the creamy cheese , the nutmeg , and the pink pepper .
Add salt to taste and blend with an immersion mixer to obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream . Once the cookies' baking time is over, remove from the oven and let them cool .
Fill half of the cookies with a teaspoon of cream and pair them with the remaining cookies . Your lady's kisses with mortadella are ready to be served !
The lady's kisses with mortadella can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, in an airtight container. You can freeze the raw dough.
Vary the filling according to your guests' tastes, for example with smoked salmon, black olive pâté, or a simple cheese cream!
