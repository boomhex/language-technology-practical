instructions:
To prepare the quick Finnish pulla, start by unrolling the puff pastry on a flour-dusted surface. With the help of a rolling pin, make it a bit thinner, stretching it on all sides. Beat the eggs in a small bowl and, without using all of it, brush the surface of the puff pastry and add cinnamon and cardamom. Cut 12 triangles using the long sides of the pastry rectangle as the base. Roll the triangles from the base towards the tip to create small croissants and slightly bring the two tips closer to give them a curved shape. Brush the outside of the pulla with the remaining beaten eggs, sprinkle with sugar granules, and bake in a preheated oven at 356°F for about 20 minutes. Your quick Finnish pulla are ready; if you can resist, enjoy them cold!
We recommend consuming the quick Finnish pulla immediately to maintain their texture; however, you can store them for a couple of days at most. They can also be frozen raw and baked in the oven after thawing them in the refrigerator.
The famous Finnish pulla bread is a brioche flavored with cardamom or cinnamon, sometimes together as we have done. Some, however, prefer an even richer filling with raisins and candied orange. Others then add almond slivers on top and prepare a vanilla glaze. Try it too!
