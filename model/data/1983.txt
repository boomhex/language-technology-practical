instructions:
To prepare the Madeira cake, start by putting the room temperature butter together with the sugar in a bowl . Then turn on the mixer, alternatively, you can use a stand mixer or a hand whisk, and whip for 5 minutes until the mixture becomes light and fluffy .
Then add the room temperature eggs, one at a time, to incorporate them without any problems . As soon as the mixture becomes fluffy and compact, turn off the mixer and add the seeds extracted from a vanilla pod . In a bowl, mix the baking powder and the flour
and add them while sifting them with a sieve . Turn on the mixer again at low speed, just long enough to mix everything . The batter is ready .
Transfer it to a greased and floured 8-inch diameter mold , carefully level the surface , and bake on the lowest shelf of the preheated static oven at 320°F, for about 70 minutes. Once the Madeira cake is baked, all that's left is to remove it from the mold and enjoy it !
You can store the Madeira cake for a couple of days under a glass dome in a cool place. If you prefer, you can freeze the cake, preferably already cut into portions. It is not possible to store the batter, so once it's ready, it should be baked.
To make the Madeira cake even more delicious, add chocolate chips or substitute the vanilla with citrus zest: it will be very fragrant!
