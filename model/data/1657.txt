instructions:
To make the summer pasta and beans, first wash and trim the celery, then cut it into slices , next peel the leek, trim it and slice it thinly . Clean the spring onion and cut it in the same way .
Wash the tomatoes, cut them into slices and then into cubes . Finally, shell the fresh beans . Once the vegetables are ready, you can proceed to cooking: heat the oil in a large pan, flavor with the chili pepper for a few moments .
then add the celery, spring onion, and leek . Sauté for a couple of minutes, then add the diced tomatoes , the basil leaves .
and the beans . Salt , pour the water until it covers the vegetables .
cover with the lid and cook over medium heat but not too high for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. After this time, remove the lid and cook for another 15-20 minutes or until the beans are tender. At this point, add the pasta and stir .
If necessary, add more water (adjust according to the consistency of the soup) . Cook the pasta for 11 minutes and when it is ready , serve it hot with some fresh basil leaves .
The summer pasta and beans can be stored in the fridge for 3 days in an airtight container. We do not recommend freezing it.
You can add carrots, zucchini, and for an even more summery touch, some diced yellow bell pepper that will blend perfectly!
