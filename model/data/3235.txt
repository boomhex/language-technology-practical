If you’re on the hunt for a perfect treat to enjoy on chilly mornings, you know, those cozy moments, Veneziane alla crema are a great choice. These soft, sweet Italian cream buns really feel like a warm hug from the very first bite. And listen, while their name might make you think they're from Venice, they’re not definitively tied to the city. Still, they’re a beloved part of Italy's pastry scene, no question.
What sets them apart, honestly, is the unique dough preparation. It features a pre-ferment known as lievitino. This technique, combined with an extended rest in the fridge, gives the dough its extra lift and tender crumb. Similar to panettone but without raisins or candied fruit—which is awesome—the dough bursts with fresh orange and lemon zest. Once shaped, each bun is topped with a creamy, rich vanilla custard and sprinkled with sugar crystals, which create super crispy pockets during baking. A final dusting of powdered sugar completes these traditional Italian pastries , making them a must-try with hot coffee.
In Italy, veneziane alla crema are especially popular as a comforting winter breakfast treat. I mean, you’ll find these brioche buns with cream in bakeries throughout Veneto and beyond. They’ve even gained fans in Rome where, truthfully, they sometimes rival the famous Maritozzi recipe . The experience of making them is almost as rewarding as eating them. The dough rests overnight to develop its moist, fluffy textures. Pretty simple, right? This makes the buns perfect for sharing with family or friends. If you’re interested in exploring Italian bakery recipes or want something beyond the typical Roman desserts, veneziane alla crema is seriously good.
Whether paired with your morning espresso or shared among friends, these pastries offer a taste of cozy Italian winter—golden, pillowy, and just a touch fancy, yet always inviting and warm. For real, can't go wrong with these.
To prepare the cream Venetians, start by making the pre-dough: dissolve the dried (or fresh) yeast in lukewarm water . In a bowl, mix the all-purpose flour and bread flour , and pour in the dissolved yeast .
Knead by hand to obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough , which you will place in a bowl covered with plastic wrap and let rise for about two hours at room temperature. Meanwhile, prepare what you need for the main dough: place the eggs in a bowl along with the milk ,
honey , grated orange and lemon zest , and the seeds from half a vanilla bean . Beat everything well with a fork.
In the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large bowl if kneading by hand), place the flours and granulated sugar . While the stand mixer's paddle is operating, pour in the egg mixture gradually . The dough should be well-mixed and soft . If you are using the stand mixer, replace the paddle with the dough hook.
At this point, the starter will have doubled in volume . Add it to the main dough in the bowl and activate the stand mixer to blend the two mixtures well . Lastly, add the softened butter at room temperature, mixed with salt, one small piece at a time while the stand mixer (speed 2) is in operation, not adding more until the previous one is incorporated . It will take about 25 minutes with the stand mixer and a bit longer if kneading by hand to achieve a smooth, soft, and compact dough. Once all the butter is incorporated, sprinkle some flour along the perimeter of the bowl so that the dough wraps around the hook and detaches from the sides of the bowl. Pour the dough onto a floured work surface and quickly shape it into a sphere.
Place the dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for at least 2-3 hours . After this time, transfer it to the refrigerator to rest for at least 8 hours and up to 12, doubling its initial volume . The dough for the Venetians can now be shaped: transfer it to a floured work surface and
work it with your hands to deflate and soften it . Form a log and divide it into 12 parts (about 80 grams each, but you can make smaller ones). Work each piece to form smooth balls , which you will place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spaced apart. Brush each ball with the yolk beaten with a couple of tablespoons of cream or milk, and let them rise in the oven with the light on until they double in volume, about 2-3 hours.
Meanwhile, as the final rise finishes, prepare the custard ( Pastry cream for the recipe card) by heating the milk with half a vanilla bean, which, once hot, you will pour into the mixture of yolks, sugar, and flour, whisked together. Return everything to the stovetop, and while stirring, thicken the cream, then let it cool. Once ready, transfer it to a piping bag and cover the surface of the Venetians with the cream forming spirals. Add the sugar sprinkles and bake them in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 25 minutes, until they are golden brown. Remove the Venetians from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack, then sprinkle with powdered sugar : your cream Venetians are ready!
Store the cream Venetians under a glass dome for 2-3 days, or freeze them after baking and reheat them in the oven as needed. It is not recommended to freeze the dough due to the delicate leavening.
You can flavor the cream with lemon zest instead of vanilla.
Try replacing the custard with a delicious Mousseline cream !
