instructions:
To prepare the azevias, start by grating the orange zest and squeezing its juice. Then, in a bowl, pour the flour, softened butter, brandy, a pinch of salt, the orange juice, and zest. Mix everything first with a wooden spoon and then by hand, adding the hot water gradually. Continue until you get a soft and consistent dough; if necessary, you can help by dusting it with a little flour. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for half an hour. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: pour the chickpeas into the mixer along with the cinnamon and almonds. Blend until they become a puree. In a saucepan, prepare a syrup by pouring in the sugar and water, then add the grated lemon zest. Bring to a boil for a couple of minutes, then off the heat add the chickpea puree and beaten egg yolks and mix everything well. Return to the heat and let cook gently, stirring often, for 5-7 minutes until the mixture thickens. Turn off and let cool. Retrieve the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin. With the help of an 8 cm diameter pastry cutter, create 25-30 discs. On each, pour a portion of filling and close the dough into a half-moon shape, sealing the edges with a little water and the tines of a fork. Fry the pastries in hot seed oil until golden and sprinkle them, once drained, with a mix of sugar and cinnamon.
Once ready, it is recommended to consume the azevias immediately.
There are many different fillings for azevias: such as pureed beans, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, and even wheat.
Perhaps you didn’t know that even in Italy we have a dessert very similar to Portuguese azevias, whose filling is also based on legumes, sugar, and lemon. Just go to Sicily to taste the cassatelle of Agira (Enna) which are fried and scented with cinnamon.
