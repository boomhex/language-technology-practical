instructions:
To prepare the chicken in a pan, first, clean the drumsticks and thighs by removing any remaining feathers with a kitchen torch . Heat extra virgin olive oil in a pan with a clove of garlic in its skin, 2 sprigs of rosemary, and 2 sprigs of thyme. Let the oil infuse for a couple of minutes. Add the chicken skin side down and sear for 5 minutes, flip the chicken, and cook for another 5 minutes .
Deglaze with white wine and let all the alcohol evaporate (this will take about 3-5 minutes). Add an untreated lemon cut into slices and continue cooking for about 25 minutes. Season the chicken with salt and black pepper.
Cook for another 5 minutes . Enhance the flavor with a few leaves of thyme. Serve the chicken in a pan while it's hot .
The chicken in a pan can be stored in the refrigerator for two days, alternatively, you can freeze it after cooking.
Here we used whole thighs including drumsticks and thighs; you can make the recipe with other parts of the chicken, such as wings.
