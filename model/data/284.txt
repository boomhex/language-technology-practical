Potato starch can be replaced with cornstarch or rice starch. For coloring, you can add natural colorants like beet juice, turmeric, or spirulina for a colorful and healthy result. For savory preparations, instead of sugar, add vegetable or meat broth, ideal for aspics or to give a glossy finish to savory dishes.
