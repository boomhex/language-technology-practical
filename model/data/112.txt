instructions:
To prepare the creamy mushroom scaloppine, first remove the earthy part of the stem . Clean the mushrooms with a damp paper towel , then slice the champignons .
Do the same with the portobello , chanterelles , and porcini .
Melt the butter in a pan , add the garlic and let it flavor for a few minutes. At this point, add the mushrooms .
Season with salt and pepper , then deglaze with white wine and cook for about 8 minutes over medium-high heat, until they are golden .
Remove the garlic, take half of the mushrooms and transfer them to a jug. Add the cream and blend with an immersion blender until you get a homogeneous cream . Set the rest of the mushrooms aside.
Now flour the veal slices, previously pounded with a meat mallet , and remove the excess flour. Melt the butter in the same pan where you cooked the mushrooms , then place the floured meat slices .
Season with salt and pepper and brown over medium heat for 4 minutes, then turn them and deglaze with white wine . Cook on the other side for about 3 more minutes until golden. Once cooked, set the meat aside covered with a sheet of aluminum foil.
Chop the parsley with a knife . Still in the same pan, pour the mushroom cream , then add the meat and heat over low heat for a minute, without stirring.
Finally, add the mushrooms and the chopped parsley and cook for another minute. Your creamy mushroom scaloppine are ready to be served !
Creamy mushroom scaloppine can be stored in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for 1-2 days.
You can replace the veal with chicken breast slices or pork loin.
If you prefer a lighter version, you can omit the cream and only use vegetable broth or a bit of milk to obtain a more delicate yet creamy sauce.
To add a crunchy touch to the dish, you can garnish the scaloppine with a handful of chopped walnuts.
