Scrippelle 'mbusse is this really charming dish from Teramo, right in the heart of Abruzzo . It's such a beautiful city, and you know what?

What sets scrippelle ‘mbusse apart from other Italian soups? The focus is on that broth and those thin crepes soaking up every last drop. In Teramo cuisine, this dish often pops up during holidays and Sunday lunches—sometimes after a heavier meal—because it feels lighter but still warms you up. And listen, the broth is usually homemade, filling the air with a rich and inviting aroma. Thing is, the secret lies in rolling the crepes just tight enough to hold, but not too tight, so the broth seeps in perfectly. Compared to some other traditional Italian soup recipes, this one’s way, way more rustic and genuine. The soft texture is a big reason why everyone loves it. Whether you call it a scrippelle recipe or just crepes in chicken broth, it brings a touch of Abruzzo right into your kitchen. These simple flavors stick with you, and each bite gives you that warm blend of broth and crepe that's simply classic. It's pretty much the kind of meal that offers not just nourishment but a taste of Italian heritage that sticks with you long after the last spoonful. Really.

To prepare scrippelle mbusse, first start with the broth. Peel the carrots and cut them into chunks , then do the same with the celery . Cut the onion in half and brown it for a few minutes in a non-stick pan .
In a large pot, place the various types of meat , then add the celery with its leaves, the carrots , and the browned onions .
Flavor with bay leaves , juniper berries , and cloves, then add a pinch of salt and cover with water .
Bring to a boil, keeping the heat at maximum; from that moment, cook over medium heat for 3 hours. During this time, you'll need to skim the broth, which means removing the fat and impurities that rise to the surface . Once ready, strain the broth using a sieve covered with a paper towel . Adjust the salt in the strained broth and keep it warm (for tips on using the boiled meat, see the end of the recipe) .
Move on to the scrippelle: in a bowl, beat the eggs with a hand whisk , then add the flour gradually, stirring continuously to avoid lumps . Slowly pour in the water, continuing to mix .
You should obtain a very fluid and homogeneous batter . Heat and oil a 16 cm (about 6 1/2 inches) diameter non-stick pan, then pour a ladle of batter in the center and swirl the pan to distribute it evenly over the bottom. Cook for 1-2 minutes over medium-high heat, then flip the scrippella and cook the other side for the same amount of time.
As they are ready, stack the scrippelle on a plate ; with these amounts, you should obtain 12. Now grate the pecorino cheese . Lay one scrippella at a time on the work surface and place a tablespoon of grated pecorino in the center .
Roll up the scrippella to form a kind of cannoli and proceed in the same way with all the others. Once they are all ready, place 3 rolled scrippelle in each deep plate .
Sprinkle with grated pecorino cheese and add a ladle of hot broth . Your scrippelle mbusse are ready to be served !
Scrippelle mbusse should be enjoyed immediately, as soon as they are immersed in the hot broth, to best appreciate their texture.
The scrippelle alone can be stored in the refrigerator, stacked and covered with plastic wrap, for up to 2 days.
The broth can be stored for 4-5 days in the refrigerator, sealed in an airtight container. You can freeze it (only if fresh ingredients and not defrosted ones have been used), preferably already portioned for more practical use.
To optimize time, you can prepare the broth even the day before.
How to use the meat from the broth? It's simple! You can shred it and dress it with green sauce, grilled vegetables, or a salad. Alternatively, you can use it to make delicious Meatballs , such as the typical Milanese Mondeghili (Milanese meatballs) !
