Orzotto with mushrooms and apples is one of those dishes that really stands out, especially during those chilly months up north in Italy. Seriously good. Places like Lombardy and Piedmont have been making this cozy orzotto recipe instead of the usual risotto. And you know what? It’s easy to see why. Barley takes the place of rice and gets cooked nice and slow, soaking up all those tender and earthy flavors from porcini mushrooms.
What makes this mushroom orzotto unique is the surprise addition of apples. They melt down, adding a sweet and pulpy bite that just works so so well with everything else. Then, as if it couldn't get better, the whole thing turns extra creamy when you stir in Pecorino cheese at the end. Talk about a sharp, savory kick that pulls everything together. Folks who like to try something new at dinner usually end up pretty happy with this. It’s not your average risotto but still gives you that same comforting, moist goodness.
Orzotto is often seen as risotto’s countryside cousin, with barley giving a bit more chew and a heartier feel. Plus, the Northern Italian twist really shines not just in the cooking method but in the way flavors are layered—first, you get that deep mushroom vibe, then, bam, the tangy sweetness of apples pops up in every spoonful. This apple orzotto totally fits into any list of cool fall recipes or healthy comfort food ideas. It works great for vegetarians or anyone looking for a vegetarian orzotto that feels special without being fussy.
And look, it’s a fun way to show off what’s in season, since mushrooms and apples both hit their stride in winter. Serve this orzotto to guests when you want something a bit different. Everyone will notice how the barley soaks up all those flavors, giving you a dish that’s golden, rich, and just begging to be eaten right away. For anyone who likes experimenting with Italian dishes, this easy orzotto recipe is an awesome way to change things up while keeping things real and satisfying. The combination of flavors and textures makes this dish a great journey into Northern Italian cuisine, perfect for those chilly evenings when you crave something both hearty and elegant.
To prepare the barley with mushrooms and apples, make the Vegetable broth that you will need hot for cooking the barley. Then move on to the How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms : remove the base of the stem clean the surface with a cloth to remove soil residues , then cut them into slices lengthwise . Set them aside and continue with the recipe.
Rinse the barley under running water , then let it drain in a colander. Peel and chop the shallot, then pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, add the chopped shallot and sauté over moderate heat until it becomes translucent. At this point, add the barley , toast for a minute,
then add a ladle of broth , salt, pepper, and continue cooking for about 20 minutes as you would for a risotto, adding the broth little by little as needed, stirring occasionally. While the barley is cooking, take care of the apples: wash and dry them, then cut them in half and then into 4 wedges. Remove the central core from the wedges ,
then without peeling, cut them into small cubes . Halfway through cooking the barley (after about 10 minutes), add the porcini mushrooms and the diced apples
Continue cooking for another 10 minutes or so, always adding the broth little by little . Grate the semi-aged Pecorino cheese and when the barley is cooked, turn off the heat and stir in the grated cheese .
Finally, season with freshly chopped parsley , stir to flavor , and immediately serve the barley with mushrooms and apples hot !
It is preferable to consume the barley with mushrooms and apples immediately; if there are leftovers, store them in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for up to 1 day. Freezing is not recommended.
As an alternative to pecorino, you can use Parmigiano Reggiano or Grana Padano.
