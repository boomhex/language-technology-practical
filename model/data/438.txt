instructions:
To make savory French toast, first pour the egg yolks and milk into a bowl , then beat well with a fork to obtain a homogeneous mixture . Dip the slices of sandwich bread into the mixture .
Ensure that the slices are completely covered on both sides . Heat a pan well with a drizzle of oil and place the slices of bread in it . Turn them occasionally until they are golden brown, then transfer them to a cutting board .
Spread the slices of bread with spreadable cheese , then add the mixed greens leaves and the slices of smoked salmon .
At this point, prepare the poached eggs: bring a pot of water to a boil, pour in the vinegar and create a vortex with a whisk , then gently slide in a whole egg that you have cracked into a separate bowl .
Let the egg cook for a couple of minutes, without touching it . Gently drain the egg with a slotted spoon and place it on top of a slice of bread . Continue this way to cook the remaining eggs.
Once ready, garnish the French toasts with a drizzle of oil , salt, pepper, and various seeds . Your savory French toast is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the savory French toast immediately.
If you prefer, you can replace cow's milk with a plant-based milk of your choice.
Instead of sandwich bread, you can also use brioche or slightly stale homemade bread slices.
