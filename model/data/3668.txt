Obviously, you start with the Rub: there are many versions, but in this case, a variant of the Cajun Rub has been used, to which brown sugar has been added and thyme and white pepper omitted. This is to 'soften' the pungent aromas by adding sweetness that mitigates the intensity. The ingredients are combined in a mortar and pounded until a well-blended powder is obtained. . To make the rub adhere well to the chicken, brush the surface of the skin with melted butter. When well brushed, sprinkle the chicken with the rub, 'rubbing' it evenly .
It is also good to insert some rub inside the upper and lower cavities of the chicken . INCREASE INTERNAL MOISTURE
When our chicken has been flavored with the rub and injected with the flavoring liquids, it must be placed on the can by inserting it into the lower cavity of the chicken. To balance it, the wings must be blocked in position behind the back, placing the thighs forward. The can has always raised several concerns due to the possibility that the epoxy resins with which they are coated could release harmful substances to the chicken. Many unofficial studies claim that the resins, having melting temperatures above 800°F, cannot release harmful substances at normal cooking temperatures. Many others claim they do. American manufacturers certainly did not miss this controversy and invented stainless steel supports that can be filled with beer or other liquids, to provide a support for Beer Can Chicken that is absolutely safe and beyond any reasonable doubt (7-8-9). Once prepared and dusted with the rub, infiltrations made, and the chicken positioned on the can (10-11), let it marinate for half an hour. Meanwhile, start lighting the barbecue. In this case, we used a type of barbecue called 'Kettle.' The kettle grill is NOT a brand but a type of barbecue (the proper term is grill and not barbecue). For more clarifications on the kettle, see the recipe for Smoked Chicken Wings with Tabouleh . COOKING THE BCC
Once the coals are lit, close the lid and act on the air vents to stabilize the temperature. When the desired temperature is reached, you can start cooking the Beer Can Chicken. First, chips are thrown directly onto the coals through a window on the food grid. The window is lifted, and using barbecue tongs, chips are placed to burn . A minimum amount of chips will be needed, as many as fit in a hand, so to speak. The lid is closed again, and you wait for the aromatic wood chips to start producing smoke.
Only after smoke production, place the support with the chicken, close the lid, and stabilize the temperature around 284°F - 320°F by adjusting the air regulation sliders, and let it cook. At these temperatures, the chicken will cook in two and a half to three hours maximum. The advantage of the low temperature is to obtain very moist and juicy meat. The chips will burn for about 20 minutes, after which a new addition will be made. This amount will be sufficient to smoke the chicken without devastating its flavor. After the smoking time, proceed to wet the chicken surface with apple cider vinegar, possibly with a sprayer (a brush will also work fine). This procedure serves as a mild 'solvent' in which the phenolic substances resulting from wood combustion will dissolve and fall to the base of the support. This will allow for a much softer smoked aroma as it will 'wash away' the unpleasant aroma substances contained in the smoke. The vinegar will not be noticeable except for a minimal increase in the acidity (which is highly recommended in these preparations) of the outer crust. WHEN IT'S COOKED It will be cooked when it's cooked. This is what an American would say. It means that cooking is subject to having been successful in stabilizing the temperature consistently. However, it is known that when using charcoal (especially if not using compressed briquettes), temperature swings are very frequent: Charcoal gradually goes out, and the temperature drops, then rises suddenly, maybe even above the limit, when replenishing. Also, frequently opening the lid to peek at the cooking food causes temperature drops. In this case, Americans have a fun saying: "If you are looking, you are not cooking." Ultimately, temperature fluctuations significantly alter cooking times. Using a probe thermometer makes everything easier. When the chicken reaches a core temperature of 180°F, it means it is perfectly cooked. Thermometers are very economical and certainly an indispensable tool. Once cooked, the chicken is served on the table directly on the can. Showing it to your guests will be a fun moment that will provide interesting conversation starters. A quick side dish can be made with potatoes cooked directly on the ash . They are wrapped in aluminum foil, placed directly on the coals, and forgotten. They will certainly be cooked together with the chicken. Beer Can Chicken is almost always the first preparation for those approaching this new and exciting cooking style.
Kettles are devices very similar to a sphere cut in two horizontally. The bottom part is called the 'firebox.' It has support legs, holes at the bottom with a ring that regulates the air flow, a grid to support the ignition fuel cubes, another grid to support the coals about 4 inches from the first, and an additional grid for the food 12 inches away (in height). The top part is called the 'lid,' but it is actually an upside-down firebox containing ventilation holes, a thermometer, and a lifting handle. The cooking system can be seen from the photos and is essentially simple: the coals are lit on the first grid and arranged on one side. The food grid is placed on which the dish will rest on the opposite side to the coals. The lid is closed, creating our convection oven. By acting on the upper and lower air intakes, the oxygen flow is regulated, which determines the cooking temperature. The more the air intakes are closed, the less oxygen will be present, and the more the coals will struggle to burn, so the lower the temperature will be. The more the air vents are opened, the more oxygen, greater combustion, higher temperature.
