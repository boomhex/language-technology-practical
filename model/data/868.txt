Gnocchi della Val Varaita is this dish that really captures the heart of the mountain valleys in Piedmont . Seriously good. Nestled near the quaint town of Melle, these tender dumplings—known locally as ravioles di Melle —give a fun twist to traditional gnocchi. And listen, instead of just potatoes, they’ve got this cheesy filling made from creamy Tomino di Melle or Raschera DOP, two popular cheeses around here.

While some might play around with different cheeses for their homemade gnocchi, using the authentic cheese from Melle really really makes all the difference. When that fresh sage sizzles in the butter, the dish gains an aromatic kick that smells so amazing. It pulls everyone to the table.
