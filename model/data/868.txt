instructions:
To prepare the cheese and pepper balls with fondue, first coarsely chop the stale bread , transfer it to a bowl, and drizzle with milk . Let it soak for 10 minutes until the bread has softened. Squeeze it well to remove excess milk and set aside.
In a bowl, place the Pecorino Romano DOP, add the eggs , the bread , and the chopped parsley .
Season with salt and pepper . Mix until you get a homogeneous mixture . If it turns out too soft, you can add some breadcrumbs.
With slightly damp hands, form balls about 1.5-2 inches in diameter and place them on a tray . Heat the seed oil to 340°F and fry a few balls at a time, so as not to lower the oil temperature too much .
When they are crispy and golden, drain them and place them on paper towels to remove excess oil . At this point, focus on preparing the fondue: pour the cream into a saucepan and heat over low heat, without bringing it to a boil .
Turn off the heat, add the grated Pecorino Romano , and stir continuously until you get a smooth and homogeneous cream. If it is too thick, you can add a little fresh cream. Pepper and stir again .
Place the balls on a serving plate and serve them with the fondue on the side . Finish with chopped parsley and another grind of black pepper. Your cheese and pepper balls with fondue are ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the cheese and pepper balls with fondue freshly made; if necessary, you can store them in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container.
You can flavor the fondue with a sprinkle of nutmeg.
If you prefer a lighter cooking method, you can bake the balls instead of frying them!
