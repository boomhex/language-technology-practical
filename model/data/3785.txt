To prepare Catalan lobster, start by slicing the red onion (preferably Tropea) into thin rounds and soak them in a bowl covered with water and a tablespoon of vinegar for at least 20 minutes. If you have purchased a live lobster, tie its claws with thick rubber bands to prevent it from pinching you. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil, in which you will quickly immerse the lobster (alternatively, you can use 2 lobsters weighing 1.3 lbs each) previously rinsed under running water; immediately cover the pot with a lid to prevent splashes of boiling water caused by the lobster's movement; after no more than 10-12 minutes, remove the lobster from the water and let it drain.
Remove the lobster from the pot and place it on a cutting board ; using a poultry shear, cut the lobster shell along the abdomen lengthwise, then spread the shell open and extract the whole meat. If you wish, you can also proceed as follows: separate the lobster's head from the rest of the body, then using a poultry shear, gently cut the shell of the tail lengthwise (both on the back and the abdomen) to extract the whole meat.
Once the lobster is split in two , slice the lobster meat into rounds, while using the appropriate tool or, if unavailable, a nutcracker (8-9), break the shell of the claws and retrieve the internal meat, extracting it whole (it will have the same shape as the claws).
In a small bowl, collect the soft part contained in the lobster's head with a spoon and mix it with oil, lemon, salt, and ground pepper. (11-12) Now slice the tomatoes, season them with oil and salt and lay them out on a serving plate, place the sliced lobster meat and claws on top, garnish with the previously drained onion rings and pour the sauce made with oil, lemon, and the soft part of the lobster collected with a spoon over it.
For a superb outcome of the Catalan lobster recipe, it would be ideal to purchase live lobster, but if you're not comfortable handling this crustacean, you can opt for frozen lobster.
