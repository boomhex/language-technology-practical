instructions:
To prepare fried primosale, first cut it into slices . Depending on the size of the primosale you have, you can choose to make slices or cubes. Break the eggs into a small bowl and beat them , then pour the breadcrumbs into another small bowl and season it with a pinch of salt . Finally, put the flour in a third small bowl. Place a pot with oil on the stove and heat it until it reaches a temperature of 329°F.
At this point, dip the primosale first in the flour and then in the egg (5-6).
Finally, coat it in the breadcrumbs ensuring it is well covered on all sides. Then transfer it to a tray and continue with the other slices. Once the oil has reached the right temperature, immerse a few pieces at a time , so as not to lower the temperature too much.
Cook for about 4 minutes, and as soon as it is well golden, drain the fried primosale and transfer it to a tray lined with paper towels . Adjust the cooking time according to the size of the primosale; our pieces were about 5.6 oz. Fry the remaining slices and serve .
It is recommended to consume the fried primosale immediately. If you prefer, you can freeze it before frying.
For an even tastier breading, season it with fresh oregano or rosemary.
