instructions:
To prepare the pioppini lasagna cupcakes, start by cleaning the mushrooms. Cut the base to detach them and then with a small brush, scrub off any soil residues. Move to the stove. In a pan, heat oil and peeled garlic, add the bacon, and let it brown over medium heat for 2 minutes so it releases its fat. Now add the pioppini mushrooms to the pan with the rosemary and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes. Salt, pepper, and let cool slightly; at the end of cooking, remove garlic and rosemary. Meanwhile, boil the fresh pasta sheets in salted boiling water for 1 minute, drain them on a very clean cloth, and let them cool. From each sheet, cut a piece of pasta: this way you will have a square and a rectangle. Brush each side with oil. Then grease 8 muffin molds with a bit of oil, place a square sheet in each, and then the rectangle. Fill with the mushroom and bacon mixture, add the cheese cubes, and bake at 430°F in a convection mode for about 20 minutes. Your pioppini lasagna cupcakes are ready, enjoy!
The pioppini lasagna cupcakes can be stored in the refrigerator for one day. You can also freeze them raw, leaving them in the mold, or cooked, placing them in a container.
Replace the bacon with sausages and the asiago with a melting cheese of your choice!
