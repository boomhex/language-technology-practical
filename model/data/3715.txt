instructions:
To prepare the ricotta, in a small pot, heat the milk, it should reach 194°F. Meanwhile, squeeze the juice of half a lemon and strain it . When the milk has reached 194°F, remove it from the heat, and pour the juice into the pot ,
stir for a few seconds with a whisk and cover with a lid . After 10 minutes, break up the curd that has formed with a wooden spoon or with the whisk.
Wait a few minutes, then start to pour a ladle of curd into a strainer placed over a bowl to collect the whey. Let the curd drain for a few seconds and transfer it to a ricotta mold . Continue this way until all the curd is used. Once completely filled, place the mold to drain on the strainer , cover with a cloth, and put it in the refrigerator for about 3 hours. Your ricotta will be ready as soon as it starts to solidify in the mold.
Store the ricotta in the refrigerator in the mold enclosed in a food bag for 3-4 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
Lemon juice is used to obtain a vegetarian version of this very simple cheese; to avoid the lemon aftertaste if you do not like it, you can use 1 1/2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar (which has a slightly more delicate flavor) or, you can purchase animal-origin rennet at the pharmacy.
