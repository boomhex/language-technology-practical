Fried corn on the cob gets a totally new twist in Italian kitchens, transforming into le pannocchie fritte . It's an appetizer that's just crunchy goodness with a burst of flavor. Really, it's the kind of thing you want on any table. And listen, this isn’t just any deep-fried corn recipe . Italians like to pair these golden cobs with spicy mayo and chives snipped right on top. Super tasty. It’s that mix of tender corn and punchy toppings. The combo of a crispy coating and the natural sweet bite of corn makes it a hit at casual dinners or when friends just show up. For sure.
Folks in different parts of Italy might add their twists, but the main idea? Pretty much: take something simple and turn it into a homemade fried corn dish everyone grabs for. It’s got that party food vibe. Fun to eat, maybe a little messy, but always gone fast.
Inspired by Southern fried corn , Italians make the most of summer corn by frying it right before serving. I mean, each bite is moist and crunchy at the same time. And the spicy mayo? It’s not overpowering—just enough to wake things up and balance out that sweet corn. Chives sprinkled over the top give a fresh, aromatic kick that really really works. You don’t even have to stress about timing—prep some steps in advance, then quickly fry the cobs when you need them. Seriously good.
Unlike pan-fried corn kernels or skillet-fried corn, this recipe keeps the cob whole. Which is great. It makes it the kind of corn side dish people remember. Whether you’re hunting for easy corn recipes for your next get-together or just want something different for your snack table, fried corn on the cob with zesty mayo hits that zone of tender inside and crispy outside. Italians might have started this as a creative finger food, but it fits right into any casual hangout where good snacks are a must. It's a delicious and fun way to enjoy corn and shows how versatile this simple ingredient can really be.

Then in the beaten eggs 4 and finally in breadcrumbs 5 . Fry 1-2 pieces at a time in oil at 340°F for about 5-7 minutes 6 .
Make sure they are well immersed in the oil 7 and when they are beautifully golden 8 , drain them on a tray lined with paper towels 9 . Salt to taste.
While you fry the corn cobs, you can prepare the spicy sauce: pour the mayonnaise into a bowl and add the chili paste 10 . Mix and transfer to a pastry bag 12 .
For plating, place the corn cobs with the stick upwards, squeeze dollops of chili mayonnaise 13 and garnish with arugula 14 , dill, and chives. Your fried corn on the cobs are ready, enjoy them immediately 15 !
