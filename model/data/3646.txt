You’ll usually find happy faces every time this nougat semifreddo with chocolate drops hits the table, so it really fits whatever kind of family fun you have planned.
Start the preparation of the charlotte by chopping the nougat (which you should have placed in the freezer for at least two hours or until it becomes very hard), first with a knife and then with the blades of a food processor . Then soak the gelatin in cold water until fully softened .
While the gelatin softens, in a small saucepan, melt the sugar and the pulp extracted from the vanilla pod (you can do this by slicing the pod lengthwise and scraping out the contents) in 3/8 cup of milk; when the sugar is dissolved, add the well-squeezed gelatin and turn off the heat. Meanwhile, pour the finely chopped nougat into a large bowl and add the remaining 3/4 cup of milk .
Then add the milk and gelatin mixture , the mascarpone , and the cream (liquid if you want a firmer dessert or semi-whipped if you desire a softer dessert) .
Mix everything well to combine the ingredients . Take a round mold (preferably a springform) with a diameter of about 8 1/2 inches , place it on a serving plate, and start lining the sides with the ladyfingers just moistened in milk . The ladyfingers should maintain their shape: they should not be soaked, but just lightly moistened.
Continue by arranging the ladyfingers on the bottom as well and proceed by pouring the nougat mixture inside (14-15). Cover the charlotte with aluminum foil and leave it to rest in the fridge for 4 hours.
To complete the nougat charlotte, it needs to be garnished with a layer of chocolate sauce, which will vary depending on the height of the mold used and the length you have given to the ladyfingers to surround the semifreddo: if there is a one or two-centimeter gap between the nougat cream and the top of the ladyfingers, you will want a less thick coating of the dessert: a sauce that just covers it. Melt the butter in the milk and add the chocolate, which you previously melted in a double boiler (17-18).
Once the cream is smooth and has cooled , pour it over the semifreddo and put the semifreddo back in the refrigerator for at least an hour to also solidify the chocolate cream . If the gap between the nougat cream and the top of the ladyfingers is larger (as in photo 20), you will need to prepare a thicker and more substantial layer of chocolate: double or triple the coating quantities, perhaps replacing milk with fresh cream (for example: 3/4 oz of butter, 7 oz of dark chocolate, and 3/4 cup of fresh cream. Or: 1 oz of butter, 10 1/2 oz of dark chocolate, and 1 1/4 cups of liquid fresh cream). In this way, you will obtain a larger quantity of cream and more compact, thus more stable once cold. Before serving it, we recommend putting the semifreddo in the freezer for an hour to make it more suitable for cutting. You can decorate the semifreddo by placing pieces of nougat on top of the dessert and wrapping the charlotte with a ribbon to be untied in front of your guests: this will give a touch of sophistication and elegance to the presentation of the semifreddo.
To cut the nougat more easily, we recommend keeping it in the freezer for at least two hours to make it as solid as possible and easier to cut without sticking to the knife blade and then to the mixer blades. To serve the charlotte at its best, we recommend putting it in the freezer before bringing it to the table, so that, by hardening, it will be easier to cut into equal slices.
