instructions:
To prepare the apricots in puff pastry, first cut the scamorza into small cubes , then wash and carefully dry the apricots, cut them in half , and remove the pit .
Using a pastry cutter with a diameter of 4 inches, cut out 6 circles from the puff pastry sheet (4-5). Place half an apricot in the center of the pastry with the round side facing down .
and fill the cavity with the scamorza cubes , then close with the other half of the apricot . At this point, wrap the pastry circle around the fruit, overlapping the edges .
on all sides and press the pastry slightly to seal it . Now place the apricots on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush the surface with egg yolk beaten with milk .
Create holes on top using the tines of a fork . Now mix the flax seeds with pink peppercorns and garnish the apricots .
The apricots in puff pastry are ready for baking : bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 15-18 minutes on the middle rack until golden brown. Once ready, take the apricots out of the oven and let them cool slightly before serving .
Apricots in puff pastry are best consumed immediately as puff pastry tends to lose its crispness if stored in the fridge.
Those who prefer stronger flavors can substitute scamorza with gorgonzola!
