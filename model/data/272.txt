Down South, you've got brown gravy made with beef drippings or white gravy that’s creamy, awesome for biscuits. The basic idea? Always something smooth, rich, and so so satisfying that ties everything together. Also, there are tons of ways to switch it up.

To make the gravy sauce, first prepare the Beef Broth using our recipe. Once the broth is ready, place the butter in a small saucepan and let it melt gently over low heat , to obtain a smooth and uniform base. When the butter is completely melted, add the flour and immediately mix with the hand whisk to create the roux .
Continue to work it over the heat, always stirring, until it starts to darken slightly and takes on a nice hazelnut color. At this point, incorporate the hot meat broth little by little , pouring it in a thin stream while continuing to stir vigorously to prevent lumps from forming . You will see that as you add the broth, the sauce will begin to thicken just like a béchamel, becoming soft and glossy. Continue cooking until you obtain a smooth and uniform creamy texture .
When the sauce has reached the desired consistency, transfer it to a heat-resistant bowl to serve . At this point, you can adjust the salt, if the broth is not already savory, and add a generous grind of black pepper to enhance the flavor of the sauce . Stir again and your gravy sauce is ready: warm, fragrant, and enveloping .
The gravy sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for 2–3 days, securely closed in an airtight container. When ready to use, simply heat it over low heat, possibly adding a spoonful of broth to restore its original consistency.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you don't have meat broth, you can substitute it with vegetable or chicken broth: the result will be more delicate but still rich and creamy. For an even more flavorful version, add the meat cooking drippings or a splash of white wine while reducing it.
Instead of flour, you can use cornstarch if you prefer a silkier consistency.
On Thanksgiving, there's another recipe that absolutely can’t be missed for a sweet ending... the Pumpkin pie !
