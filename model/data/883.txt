instructions:
To make cuttlefish in zimino, first clean and finely chop the onion , celery , and carrot .
Clean the greens by removing the tougher part of the stems, then cut the leaves into 3-4 parts depending on their size ; you will need about 15 oz. Rinse the cleaned baby cuttlefish under running water . In a large saucepan, add a drizzle of oil along with carrots, celery, onion, and a peeled garlic clove , then stew over medium heat for about 7-8 minutes.
After this time, remove the garlic from the sauté and add the greens . Wilt the greens for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, then add the whole baby cuttlefish .
Deglaze with white wine and let it evaporate completely, then add the tomato puree , season with salt and pepper .
Cover with a lid and cook on low heat for about 20 minutes ; the cooking time may vary depending on the size of the cuttlefish. Once cooked, flavor with fresh marjoram leaves . Mix well and serve your cuttlefish in zimino with toasted bread slices !
The cuttlefish in zimino can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of baby cuttlefish, you can use larger cuttlefish and cut them into strips about 3/4 inch wide.
You can replace the greens with spinach or chard.
Instead of tomato puree, you can use canned tomatoes.
