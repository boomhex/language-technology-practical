instructions:
To prepare the Swiss grittibänz, start by pouring the butter and milk into a small saucepan, then let them return to room temperature before adding the crumbled yeast and dissolving it with a teaspoon. In a stand mixer with a hook, or in a bowl if you are working by hand, add the flour and sugar. Begin kneading for about ten minutes at medium speed, pouring in the liquid mixture all at once. A couple of minutes before the dough is ready, incorporate a teaspoon of salt. Form a ball, cover it with plastic wrap, and let the dough rise for 2-3 hours or until the dough has doubled in size. Divide it into 12 parts and shape each piece into a cylinder. Cut the cylinders at one end to create legs, then further up for arms, and finally shape the head. Use leftover dough to decorate the figures by forming scarves, hats, and the characteristic pipe. Brush each figure's surface with beaten egg and sprinkle with sugar grains and chopped nuts for shoes and hats. Place them on a sheet of parchment paper on a baking tray and bake the Swiss grittibänz in a preheated oven at 356°F for about 30-35 minutes. Once cool, you can enjoy them!
Once ready, the Swiss grittibänz can be stored for 2-3 days under a glass dome or in a tin box.
Use raisins to make the eyes of your Swiss grittibänz!
All over Switzerland, Swiss grittibänz are popular in local bakery windows with their characteristic bread aroma. Tradition has it that children singing Christmas carols on the streets from November 11th, St. Martin's Day, are given these figures along with a non-alcoholic apple-based punch (kinderpunsch) or hot chocolate. But who is behind this figure? In the 300s, St. Martin is said to have torn a piece of his cloak to give to a beggar who was clutching his pipe, his only source of warmth. Therefore, the brioche bread figure represents the poor man who was saved by the Saint. The same tradition is celebrated in other European countries where the treat's name varies. In Germany, they are known by multiple names, such as weckmann, in France as bonhomme de Saint-Nicolas (manalas or mannele), in Luxembourg as boxemännchen, and in the Netherlands as klaaskerl. In Switzerland, they are also known as grättimaa. Even in Italy, we have a dessert that pays homage to St. Martin's memory: a glazed and decorated cookie depicting the Saint on horseback with his sword and famous cloak.
