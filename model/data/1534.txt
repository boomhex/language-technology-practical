Puff pastry twists, or "treccine di sfoglia e crema" as they call 'em in Italy, are one of those easy puff pastry recipes that just make a weekend breakfast special. You know, something you’ll really look forward to. They are all about that crispy, golden outside and the tender, creamy filling that's a little bit special but not too fancy. Over in Italian homes, folks usually prep the pastry cream the night before. I mean, why rush in the morning? Just roll, braid, and pop those twists in the oven. And as they bake, there's this sweet smell that fills the kitchen. Honestly, it pulls everyone right out of bed.
And listen, people sometimes add chocolate chips, hazelnut spread, or chopped nuts to the filling. So, everyone gets what they like best. Plus, there’s even a jam version for a bit of tangy fun. Every batch could pretty much become its own little family tradition. In Italy, some families use these puff pastry appetizers to get everyone around the table, especially on those lazy mornings when nobody’s rushing.
It's not just about breakfast. The same recipe works for cheese twists or those puff pastry twists you spot at parties. Just switch the filling and bam! You've got savory puff pastry snacks perfect with coffee or as a pre-dinner treat. The texture stays moist inside, with that golden crunch outside—super super satisfying. Great right out of the oven or even later on.
With so many options—cinnamon sugar, sweet cream, or nutty bits—these twists become one of those simple baking recipes everyone loves, no matter their favorite flavors. Spending a bit of time the night before makes everything easier. And for real, the smell of fresh pastry is enough to bring a smile to anyone's face. There's just something about homemade pastry twists that makes the day start out right and keeps everyone coming back for more. Which is great.
To prepare the puff pastry twists, start by making the filling cream. Pour the milk into a saucepan, add the sliced vanilla pod and heat everything until it almost reaches a boil. Meanwhile, in another large enough saucepan, crack the eggs and add the sugar .
Quickly beat everything with a whisk , then add the cornstarch and stir to absorb it .
When the milk is almost boiling, remove it from the heat and discard the vanilla pod . Then slowly pour it into the other saucepan , stirring constantly with the whisk .
Put the saucepan back on the heat and continue stirring for about 3 minutes until the cream thickens . Then transfer it to a baking dish and cover it with plastic wrap touching the surface . Let it cool first at room temperature and then in the refrigerator, then place it in a piping bag.
When the cream is completely cold, roll out the puff pastry and divide it into 4 rectangles (13-14). Take one of the rectangles and further divide it into 3 sections, widthwise; you shouldn't cut through the pastry completely, just create a sort of guide for the next step .
Cut 6 diagonal strips of 0.6 inches on the two outer rectangles (16-17). Put a teaspoon of jam on the central rectangle
and spread it only on this section . Place two strips of cream on top of the jam and start closing your braid. You should bring the strips from the right to the left
and vice versa until you completely cover the filling . Gradually transfer the twists to a baking tray lined with parchment paper .
Once you have finished making them, brush with milk and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 15 minutes. Once golden brown, take your puff pastry twists out of the oven and serve !
The puff pastry twists can be stored for 1 day under a glass dome.
You can use this technique to create sweet or savory puff pastry twists. The fillings are endless, you can choose your favorite jam, a spread, or even deli meats, vegetables, and cheeses!
