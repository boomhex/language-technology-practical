To prepare the mini strudels with chard, ricotta, and speck, first start with the filling: wash the chard and cut it into pieces . Boil for 5 minutes in salted water, then drain and cool in ice water .
Cut the speck into strips . In a bowl, place the ricotta, then add the Parmesan and the speck .
Add the egg and season with salt, pepper , and a pinch of nutmeg .
Drain and thoroughly squeeze the chard , then add it to the bowl . Mix to combine the ingredients .
Cut the puff pastry into 4 rectangles of about 4x6 inches . Place a little filling in the center of the rectangles , then brush the edges with a beaten egg yolk .
Fold the short sides inward , then roll up making sure to seal the ends well. Make cuts on the surface of the rolls .
Place the mini strudels on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush the surface with the beaten egg yolk , then sprinkle with poppy seeds . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 20-25 minutes or until the pastry is crispy and golden. Take out of the oven and let the mini strudels with chard, ricotta, and speck cool for a few minutes before serving !
The mini strudels with chard, ricotta, and speck can be stored in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for 2 days.

If you prefer, you can use spinach, sautéed zucchini, or roasted pumpkin instead of chard.
For a vegetarian version, replace the speck with sun-dried tomatoes!
