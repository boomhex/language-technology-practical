instructions:
To prepare the spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs, start by washing and cleaning the vegetables for the sauce sauté: cut the celery and carrot into sticks and finely chop them, then do the same with the onion .
In a large pan, heat a drizzle of oil, then add the chopped vegetables and let them stew gently for a few minutes until tender . Remove the sauté from the pot and set aside.
Add the ground meat and let it brown until it changes color . Then deglaze with the red wine and let the alcohol evaporate.
Add the honey , the paprika , and the sautéed vegetables again .
Cover with tomato sauce , add salt , pepper, cover with the lid , and cook over moderate heat for 90 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the meatballs: soak the bread cubes in milk , then squeeze well and transfer to another bowl where you have the ground meat . Add thyme, grated cheese, beaten egg , and salt.
Knead by hand to obtain a homogeneous mixture, then form walnut-sized meatballs ; you should get about 12. Pass the meatballs one by one in semolina and keep them on a tray .
Heat the seed oil in a pot, and when it reaches a temperature of about 338°F-356°F, immerse the meatballs , a few at a time, and fry until golden brown . Drain the meatballs on a tray lined with absorbent paper to dry the excess oil .
Now cook the spaghetti al dente in salted boiling water . Extend the ready sauce with a ladle of cooking water . Drain the spaghetti here and finish cooking.
Once ready , serve the spaghetti dressed with the sauce, also adding the meatballs to the plate . Complete with a sprinkle of grated cheese and serve the spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs immediately!
We recommend consuming the spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs immediately. If there are leftovers, you can store them in the fridge for a couple of days.
Sauce and meatballs can be frozen separately if you have used fresh meat.
We recommend frying the meatballs a few at a time to avoid lowering the oil temperature.
