First, it is necessary to remove the string from the sausages (if still present) and cut them to handle each sausage individually . The sausages should not be pierced before, during, or after cooking. The openings at the ends will suffice to drain excess fat. The grill should be set up for indirect cooking. When the coals are ready, throw water-soaked cherry chips onto the coals for at least 30 minutes. Close the lid and wait for the smoke to be produced.
At this point, place the sausages on the grill away from the heat source, ensuring some space between each one to allow the smoke to pass through. Close the lid, stabilize the temperature at 340°F, and smoke for an hour, adding wood chips and/or already lit charcoal to maintain the grill's temperature. Once the temperature is stabilized, grill the vegetables in the classic method: simply by thinly slicing, brushing with excellent extra virgin olive oil , and grilling at very high heat for a few seconds (6-7).
15 minutes before finishing the sausage cooking, fill an aluminum tray with beer . Add the grilled lime and some vegetables . Place it on the grill or stove and bring it to a boil. Let it simmer until the sausages are ready. If smoked correctly, the sausages should appear a deep garnet red color and should have a strong smoked flavor.
Once these characteristics are achieved, remove them from the grill and soak them in the beer . The beer will maintain a very high moisture level and provide a slight flavor surplus that will pleasantly surprise you. While the sausages remain warm in the beer bath, prepare the ciabatta. Open it , remove any excess crumb, if necessary, and brush it with extra virgin olive oil (12-13)
and place it on the grill for a moment to allow a good toasting of the inside . Meanwhile, prepare the dijonnaise sauce by dissolving the sugar in lime juice and then combining all the ingredients and mixing (the sauce can be stored in the fridge for a week). Once the desired level of toasting is reached, spread two tablespoons of dijonnaise sauce on each side of the bread .
Begin stuffing the sandwich with eggplants . Split the sausages lengthwise and place them on top of the eggplants (18-19).
Next, add the grilled peppers and onion on top of the sausages , close the top , and all that's left is to serve it to our guests, perhaps accompanied by a nice cold beer (but not ice-cold). A simple, rustic preparation with intense flavors. Also ideal for an autumn barbecue. The smoked sausages will amaze you.
