instructions:
To prepare the baked gnocchi with pumpkin and toma, start by boiling the potatoes. Place them in a pot with cold water and turn on the heat. Once the water is boiling, count about 30-40 minutes, depending on their size. Peel them while still hot and immediately mash them onto the flour spread on the work surface . Then add the lightly beaten egg along with a pinch of salt
and knead everything with your hands until you obtain a soft but compact dough . Remember that overworking them will make the gnocchi hard during cooking, so only knead as necessary. Take a portion of the dough and roll it with your fingertips to form strands about 0.75 inches thick ; use some semolina to lightly flour the work surface as needed. Meanwhile, cover the remaining dough with a cloth to prevent it from drying.
Then cut the strands into small pieces and, with a gentle pressure of your thumb, roll them on a gnocchi board to achieve the classic shape . If you don't have a gnocchi board, you can use a fork and roll them on the tines; again, use semolina flour to prevent sticking. As you prepare the potato gnocchi, place them on a tray with a lightly floured cloth, spaced apart from each other .
Now, take care of the sauce. Take the cleaned pumpkin and cut it first into slices and then into cubes about 0.4 inches in size . In a pan, pour a drizzle of oil and add a clove of garlic cut in half. Add the rosemary sprigs
and sage leaves . Allow them to infuse over medium heat for 2-3 minutes, then add the pumpkin . Season with salt
and stir well . Wait a few minutes, then remove the rosemary sprigs , sage, and garlic. Cook the pumpkin for about 12 minutes total. Meanwhile, cut the cheese into cubes .
When the pumpkin is ready , cook the gnocchi in batches in plenty of boiling salted water as desired . As they are ready, drain them with a slotted spoon and transfer them into the pan with the pumpkin .
Add a drizzle of oil and mix well. Now compose the cocottes. You will get 4 in total. Place a first layer of pumpkin gnocchi on the base , add some cubes of toma and grated Grana Padano DOP .
Cover with a second layer of gnocchi and finish with more pieces of toma and grated Parmesan cheese . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 8 minutes, then turn on the grill at the highest setting and finish baking until well gratinated. This will take a couple of minutes. Remove the gnocchi from the oven, decorate with rosemary sprigs, and serve.
The gnocchi with pumpkin and toma can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days, well covered.
For an extra touch, add crumbled and sautéed sausage!
