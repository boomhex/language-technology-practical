Homemade canning and jam making can pose health risks. In a domestic setting, it is not possible to create the conditions and measures necessary to ensure the safety and suitability of food, which industrial procedures can guarantee to prevent dangerous contamination. It is therefore important to meticulously follow food safety guidelines to reduce risks, but it's always important to remember that the same level of food safety as professionally produced preserves and jams can never be achieved. For correct homemade preserve preparation, we refer to the guidelines from the Ministry of Health .
