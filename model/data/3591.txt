To prepare the smoked herring salad, you need to prepare the herrings in advance: if you use fresh uncleaned herrings, cut off the head, tail, and belly. Open the herring to gut it, remove the bones with tweezers; divide the fillets into strips and place them in a bowl. Pour the milk and let the herring fillets soak for several hours, preferably overnight .
Peel and finely slice the onion and place it in a bowl with cold water : also in this case, let it soak for several hours or overnight, changing the water at least a couple of times, so that it loses its intense taste. Boil the potatoes : they must be tender but not falling apart.
When they are cooked, peel them , then cut them into cubes and set them aside. Peel the apple
and cut the slices into small cubes. After the soaking time, drain the herring fillets and place them on a tray with paper towels to dry them completely .
Do the same with the onion slices , then compose your salad: in a bowl pour the potatoes, herring fillets , onions
and apples . Mix and set aside while you prepare the dressing: in a small bowl pour the Greek yogurt and chopped chives . Then squeeze the lemon juice and strain it.
to combine it with the yogurt . Also add the oil and emulsify everything .
Pour the obtained cream over the salad , adjust the salt and pepper and blend the ingredients well ; serve your smoked herring salad as a delightful side dish !
Store the smoked herring salad in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Soaking the herring is used to soften its flavor and tenderize the meat, while soaking the onion helps to lessen its intense taste.
