instructions:
To prepare vegetarian stuffed artichokes, first focus on the How to clean artichokes . Remove the stem , take off the outer and tougher leaves , and cut off the tips .
Slightly open the leaves and as you clean them, immerse the artichokes in acidulated water . Take the stems, remove the harder final part, and peel them .
Then slice them into thin rounds . Cook the artichokes and the stems in salted boiling water for 15 minutes.
Drain everything and cool in ice water , then place the artichokes on absorbent paper to dry them . Meanwhile, prepare the filling: drain the stems and transfer them to a food processor .
Add the sliced bread and walnut kernels , then blend until you obtain a homogenous mixture .
Transfer the mixture to a bowl and add the cottage cheese , hazelnut crumble , and grated pecorino .
Adjust with salt and pepper . Then add the lemon zest and a few marjoram leaves . Mix to combine the ingredients.
Add the egg and mix once again. Stuff the artichokes with the obtained filling , then place them in a baking tray and drizzle the surface with oil .
Moisten with vegetable broth and bake in a static oven at 392°F (200°C) for 20 minutes. After this time, switch to grill mode at 446°F (230°C) and continue cooking for 3 minutes . Finish with a few marjoram leaves and serve your vegetarian stuffed artichokes!
Vegetarian stuffed artichokes can be stored in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for 2 days. Before serving, reheat them in the oven at 356°F (180°C) for about 10 minutes.
If you prefer, you can replace pecorino with Parmesan.
