Mezzelune dolci are these really good half-moon pastries you'll find on Italian breakfast tables or as a snack. Pretty simple, right? And when you're craving something sweet but not too heavy, they hit the spot. The thing is, mezzelune dolci are special because they wrap a soft, fragrant filling of sautéed pears, loads of peach jam, and amaretti cookies that just melt in your mouth. I mean, different regions in Italy might add their own twist—like swapping out the fruit—but that combo of tender fruit and crunchy amaretti? It's really, really loved. With a dusting of powdered sugar on top, they look beautifully golden and seriously good. These pastries capture that Italian knack for simplicity and flavor, and they're quite addictive when fresh from the oven and moist inside.
Few desserts mix flavors like these— dolci con pere , dolci con confettura di pesche , and buttery, nutty amaretti, all in one bite. So here's the thing, Italians usually enjoy these mid-morning or as an afternoon treat, often with coffee or milk. And the filling? It's a sweet blend of jam, soft pears, and amaretti, offering a crispy bite that's unique from ordinary fruit pastries. The thin pastry dough perfectly holds all that goodness, pretty much what you'd expect from dolci italiani tradizionali and dolci ripieni di frutta . The result is a snack that feels fancy yet fits right in on any table, whether part of a big breakfast spread or just a personal treat. Grab a couple while they’re still warm, and you’ll see why they’re a favorite among fans of ricetta mezzelune dolci and anyone who loves dolci con amaretti . They’re a true testament to the art of Italian baking, offering a taste experience that's both comforting and exciting. For real.
To prepare sweet half-moons with pears, peach jam, and amaretti, peel the pears , cut them into 4 parts, removing the core and stem , and dice them .
Grate the zest of 1 lemon , then squeeze its juice . Place a non-stick pan on the stove and add the pear cubes, brown sugar ,
lemon zest and juice . Turn on the heat and sauté the pears in the pan for 7-8 minutes. Once ready, transfer the mixture you have obtained to a bowl and let it cool. Then add the peach jam ,
crumble the amaretti and add them to the now cold pears along with the cinnamon .
Mix everything together , then take one disc of dough at a time and start filling them by placing a couple of teaspoons of the prepared filling ,
then brush the edges with a beaten egg , fold the disc over itself to form a half-moon , pressing with your fingers to make the dough adhere and
using a fork to seal them well . As you prepare them, place the half-moons on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Finally, brush them with the remaining beaten egg and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 10 minutes (or at 356°F for 8 minutes if using a fan oven). Once ready , remove the half-moons from the oven and let them cool on a rack; you can serve your sweet half-moons with pears, peach jam, and amaretti with a dusting of powdered sugar to taste.
It is recommended to consume the sweet half-moons with pears, amaretti, and peach jam immediately. Freezing is not recommended.
Try your delicious half-moons using apples instead of pears and add some pine nuts: they'll be delicious! If you prefer, you can also use shortcrust pastry.
