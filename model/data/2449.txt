To prepare the banana smoothie, start by taking the lemon. Cut it in half and extract the juice from one half . Now take a banana, peel it and cut it into slices . Place the banana slices in a bowl and sprinkle them with the juice of half a lemon .
Now take the banana to which you added the juice of half a lemon and put it in a blender . Then add the water . Blend well until you get a smooth and homogeneous mixture. Now serve your banana smoothie in a glass or a pitcher .
It is preferable to consume the banana smoothie just prepared. It can be stored in the fridge for a couple of hours, but remember that fresh fruit, in this case, the banana, oxidizes easily. Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer a less creamy and more liquid texture for your banana smoothie, you can add more water to the smoothie.

A pinch of fresh grated ginger or cinnamon will give this classic smoothie an extra kick.
