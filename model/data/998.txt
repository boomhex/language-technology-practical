instructions:
To make the savory cream puffs with Grana Padano cream, start by preparing the choux pastry: first, pour the water , milk , and salt into a saucepan. Add the cubed butter and bring everything to a boil.
Add 20 g of Grana Padano PDO and stir with a spatula or wooden spoon. At this point, add the flour all at once and mix. Don't be afraid of lumps and stir quickly; cook the mixture until a white film forms on the bottom of the pan, which will take at least 2-3 minutes .
Transfer the batter to a bowl and add one egg at a time , always stirring to incorporate it. Don't worry if the dough seems separated at first, just keep mixing. Only when each egg is completely absorbed should you add the next one. Once the eggs are incorporated, you should have a smooth and consistent dough . Then transfer it to a pastry bag fitted with a plain 12-13 mm nozzle .
Now take a baking sheet and line it with parchment paper; to make it stick to the tray, squeeze a little batter in opposite corners and in the center to act as an adhesive. Squeeze mounds of dough the size of a walnut , spacing them apart. Once you've filled the tray, slightly flatten the tops of the puffs to smooth the tips . Sprinkle 10 g of Grana Padano PDO over each puff . Bake in a preheated static oven at 428°F for about 15 minutes, until golden brown. Avoid opening the oven at this stage. After this time, finish baking at 356°F for another 15-20 minutes, mimicking an open valve by wedging a ball of aluminum foil between the door and the oven's frame.
Remove the cream puffs from the oven and let them cool before filling them . Prepare the Grana Padano PDO cream: in a saucepan, add the butter and melt it over medium heat, then add the pepper and pour in the flour .
Stir quickly with a whisk, then pour in the whole milk and bring to a boil until it thickens. Once thickened , turn off the heat, add the Grana Padano PDO , and stir to melt it.
Let cool to room temperature . Then transfer the cream to the fridge to cool completely. Meanwhile, drain the sun-dried tomatoes and slice them into thin strips . Once the cream is cold, transfer it to a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle .
Cut the cream puffs in half, now cool . Fill the base of the puffs with Grana Padano PDO cream and some sun-dried tomatoes .
Flavor with chives and cover the cream puffs with the other half . The savory cream puffs with Grana Padano cream are ready to be enjoyed .
You can store the empty cream puffs in an airtight bag for up to 2 weeks, away from moisture. The cream can be stored in the fridge, covered, for 1-2 days at most. Once assembled, the cream puffs should be consumed the same day.
Make sure the cream puffs are completely cool before cutting them in half and use a serrated knife to make this operation easier.
