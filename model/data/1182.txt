To prepare thyme bread with sourdough, start by preparing the thyme infusion, which you can also do the day before. Trim the thyme by running your fingers along the stems to collect only the leaves . Bring 350 g of water to a boil; take a jug and put two tablespoons of fresh thyme , then add the boiling water .
Allow the thyme infusion to cool completely, then strain it with a sieve . Crumble the refreshed sourdough starter in a bowl, add 50 g of water and mix until completely dissolved .
Pour the flour into a bowl and add the dissolved sourdough starter . Gradually add the thyme infusion , and mix with a spoon .
Add the malt powder and fine salt . Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead with your hands
until a smooth and homogeneous dough is obtained . It will take about 15 minutes. Place the dough in a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap
and let it rise until doubled in size . It will take about 5 hours. After the resting time, turn the dough out onto a floured surface and gently deflate it with your hands, trying to give it a rectangular shape .
With a dough scraper, divide the dough into 4 equal parts . Flatten each portion
and form the loaves: start by closing the long side of the dough rectangle towards the outside and roll it up completely .
Place the loaves on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, with the seam side down . Let the loaves rise until doubled in size. It will take about 2 hours. Dust the loaves with durum wheat semolina and make cuts on the surface ,
spacing them a couple of centimeters apart . Bake in a preheated fan oven at 482°F, placing a small pot of water at the bottom of the oven, for 10 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 392°F, remove the pot of water and continue baking for 25 minutes. For the last 5 minutes, bake with the oven door slightly open using a wooden spoon, to let out moisture. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack before serving.
You can store the loaves in a food bag for 2-3 days. Alternatively, you can freeze them.
If you can't find fresh thyme, you can use dried thyme, the quantity will remain the same!
