When two great classics of Sicilian cuisine like the Catanese scacciata and pasta alla Norma come together, a masterpiece is born: the scacciata alla Norma! Also known as mpanata , the scacciata is a sort of rustic focaccia that was originally made with leftover bread dough and filled with whatever ingredients were available at home. Here we offer you a tasty filling based on fried eggplants, tomato sauce, salted ricotta, and basil, an unbeatable mix of flavors inspired by the namesake dish, Norma. The preparation requires some time and patience, but as soon as you bite into the scacciata alla Norma, you will be rewarded for every effort!

To prepare the scacciata alla Norma, start with the dough: pour the semolina into a large bowl along with part of the lukewarm water , then add the crumbled fresh yeast . Mix with a spoon to dissolve the yeast, then add the salt to the sides of the bowl .
Also pour in the oil and the remaining water. Be careful: the amount of water may vary depending on the type of flour used, so adjust based on the consistency of the mixture . Mix again with the spoon until the liquid is completely absorbed . Cover the bowl with a cloth and let it rest for 10 minutes, preferably in the oven turned off with the light on.
After this time, transfer the mixture to the work surface and work it vigorously with your hands for about ten minutes, without adding flour . If you have a lot of difficulty working the dough, let it rest again for another ten minutes. When the dough is no longer sticky but smooth and homogeneous, shape it into a ball with the help of a dough scraper and put it back in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for about 2 hours, always in the oven turned off with the light on. The rising time is indicative; the dough should double in volume .
In the meantime, prepare the eggplants: trim the eggplants and, if desired, peel them . Slice the eggplants lengthwise into slices of less than 1/2 inch thick .
Arrange the eggplant slices on a rack placed over a tray and sprinkle them with coarse salt ; let them rest for about 30 minutes, so they release their water. Slice the mozzarella and let it drain in a colander .
Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: pour the tomato pulp into a saucepan , add the salt and sugar . Stir and turn on the heat.
Cook over moderate heat for about 15-20 minutes, mashing the tomato pieces with a fork . When the sauce has thickened, turn off the heat and season with a drizzle of olive oil , then add the basil leaves and set aside.
At this point, rinse the eggplants to remove the salt and pat them dry with a cloth , then proceed with frying: heat the seed oil to 340°F and immerse 1-2 slices at a time .
When they begin to color, turn them over with kitchen tongs . Once golden, drain the eggplants and transfer to paper towels .
After the rising time, turn the dough onto a work surface dusted with semolina , then divide it in half with a dough scraper . Gently flatten the first part of the dough with your hands .
Roll it out with the rolling pin to a thickness of about 0.2 inches , then sprinkle the surface with a little semolina and transfer it to a 13 1/2-inch diameter baking pan, lightly greased with oil. Gently stretch the dough to cover the edges , then place the fried eggplants at the base and cover with the tomato sauce .
Add the mozzarella slices and grate the salted ricotta , then finish with the basil leaves .
Now roll out the second portion of dough, also to a thickness of about 0.2 inches . Sprinkle the dough with a little semolina, roll it onto the rolling pin, and lay it over the pan to cover the filling . Match the edges by gently stretching them and press with your fingertips to adhere.
Trim off excess dough and fold the edge inward to seal it . Brush the surface with oil and make a hole in the center to allow steam to escape during baking .
Bake in a fan-assisted preheated oven at 450°F for 30 minutes, then lower the temperature to 350°F and continue baking for another 10 minutes . Once cooked, remove from the oven and let cool on a rack for about 45 minutes, covered with a cloth . Your scacciata alla Norma is finally ready to be sliced and enjoyed !
The scacciata alla Norma can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
The dough can also be made in a stand mixer with a dough hook.
If you prefer, you can leave the eggplants unpeeled.
Instead of tomato pulp, you can use tomato puree.
The resting time is very important as it allows the scacciata to compact before being cut.
