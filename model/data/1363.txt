instructions:
To make the eggplant roses, first wash and dry the eggplants, then remove the two ends and slice them across the short side into thin slices about 0.2 inches thick ; you should get about 40 slices in total. Arrange them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, drizzle with some extra virgin olive oil , add salt , and bake in a fan oven at 356°F for about 15 minutes.
After this time, remove the eggplants from the oven and let them cool. Season the tomato sauce with a dash of oil and salt .
Flavor with oregano and mix. Meanwhile, unroll the puff pastry and cut it into 4 strips about 2.5 inches wide, cutting them lengthwise . Take each strip of pastry and spread the tomato sauce along its entire length using a brush or spoon .
Sprinkle some grated cheese over the tomato and place 5 eggplant slices on the top part of the strips, leaving a lower edge of about 0.4 inches .
Fold the lower edge over the eggplants and roll up the strip of pastry to form roses : with these amounts you'll get 8 roses.
Grease 8 molds of a muffin tray, place the roses inside , brush the surface with the remaining sauce , and sprinkle with the remaining grated cheese .
Finally, flavor with oregano and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 30 minutes. Once cooked, remove your eggplant roses from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving at the table !
The eggplant roses can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days. It's possible to freeze them after cooking.
To make the seasoning more aromatic, make a basil sauce to spread on the base of the pastry.
