instructions:
To prepare the wholemeal oat plumcake, pour the softened butter and brown sugar into a bowl. Work the ingredients with electric beaters for about 1 minute .
Add the egg yolk and work with the beaters for a few more seconds. Incorporate the flour and baking powder .
Pour the oat beverage and work with the beaters until you obtain a homogeneous mixture. Finally, add the oat flakes and mix .
Butter and flour a 8x4 inch plumcake mold. Pour the mixture into the mold , distribute it evenly, and level it with the back of a spoon . Make a central cut with a knife previously dipped in melted butter .
Spread the oat flakes on the surface . Bake in a static oven at 356°F for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven, let it cool completely , and remove your wholemeal oat plumcake from the mold
The wholemeal oat plumcake can be stored for about 4 days at room temperature. You can freeze it after it has been cooked and completely cooled.
The step of passing the knife through the melted butter allows the blade to glide more easily through the batter.
