instructions:
To make the cherry tomato and caper tatin, first wash all the cherry tomatoes and cut them in half . Clean and thinly slice the onion . In an 11-inch diameter skillet, suitable for oven cooking, pour the olive oil ,
arrange the cherry tomatoes cut side down , then also distribute the onion rings , sprinkle with brown sugar , salt, and pepper
and cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes with the lid on . Then remove the lid and continue cooking for another 5 minutes. After this time, wait another 5 minutes to let the pan cool slightly, then lay the shortcrust pastry sheet over the pan to completely cover the filling , fold the pastry along the entire edge .
Transfer the pan to a preheated fan-assisted oven at 390°F for about 10 minutes or until the pastry is golden on the surface . Once cooked, flip the tatin onto a serving plate , garnish with caper flowers ,
fresh basil leaves , and stracciatella cheese . Serve your cherry tomato and caper tatin piping hot .
The cherry tomato and caper tatin can be stored in the refrigerator for 1 day, covered with plastic wrap. It is possible to freeze the tatin after cooking.
Get creative with the variations: Parmesan, spicy salami; the tatin pizza lends itself to the most appetizing fridge-cleaning experiments!
