The orzotto con zucchine e fiori di zucca is this classic dish from Lombardy, Italy—really, it’s something else. It takes the beloved risotto and switches things up with pearl barley instead of rice. And you know, this gives it a creamy but lighter texture, which is awesome for those warm summer days. The magic? It’s in the tender zucchini and those delicate squash blossoms, known as fiori di zucca. They add such a fresh and aromatic touch. Seriously good. Plus, a splash of white wine and fresh basil really really bring out the flavors, making it a fantastic orzotto estivo . I mean, it's a perfect primo piatto vegetariano that feels special without being too heavy. And the sauce? Well, it’s a summer staple in Northern Italy, balancing rustic charm with culinary sophistication.
What makes orzotto con zucchine e fiori di zucca exciting is its versatility. And look, people in Lombardy often add their own twist, like a pinch of saffron or maybe a dash of curry powder for that golden hue and a slightly earthy flavor.

The orzo becomes soft yet has this pleasant bite, soaking up the veggie flavors and last hints of wine.

To prepare the barley risotto with zucchini and zucchini flowers, start by boiling the barley: pour it into a large pot and add plenty of salted water to cover the barley . Boil it for 35 minutes or as indicated on the package. Once cooked, drain it and transfer it to a bowl to cool slightly. Now take care of the seasoning: wash the zucchini, trim them, and cut them into quarters lengthwise. Then slice them to obtain triangles about a quarter-inch thick .
Then move on to the zucchini flowers: soak them in cold water to wash them, then let them dry on a cloth or paper towel. Remove the stem with a knife and the pistils inside the zucchini flowers (5-6).
Then finely chop them . From the basil bunches, take some leaves for decoration , while chopping the amount needed for the recipe .
In a large pan, pour a drizzle of oil , then add the previously cleaned and finely chopped shallots . Sauté for 1 minute, then add the zucchini cooking them over medium heat for 10 minutes.
When the zucchini start to soften, add the basil . Sauté the ingredients over high heat for a few seconds and then add the chopped zucchini flowers , letting everything cook over medium heat for a few minutes until the zucchini flowers are tender.
