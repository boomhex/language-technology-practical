To prepare fried sweet potatoes, first peel the sweet potatoes . Cut them into slices about 1/2 inch thick and then into matchsticks , obtaining sticks about 1/2 inch wide.
Meanwhile, heat the oil to 340°F, and while the temperature is rising, finely chop the garlic (remove the germ) along with the rosemary and thyme, both stripped from their stems . Transfer to a bowl and add the salt . Mix well and set aside.
Immerse a few sweet potato sticks at a time, using a slotted spoon . Wait about 5 minutes, and when they are golden brown, remove them from the oil and transfer them to a tray lined with paper towels to remove excess oil .
Continue frying the sweet potatoes this way , and finally sprinkle them with the aromatic mix , toss them, and serve while still hot .
We recommend consuming the sweet potatoes immediately.
Along with the proposed mix, try adding paprika: spicy if you love it, smoked if you want to give it a smoky touch.
