instructions:
To prepare the white chocolate ganache, pour the cream into a saucepan and bring it just to a boil . Meanwhile, finely chop the chocolate and place it in a large bowl.
Pour about 1/3 of the hot cream over the white chocolate and start stirring, keeping the cream warm on very low heat in the meantime. Then add half of the remaining cream (keeping the cream warm) and continue to stir . Add the rest of the cream and stir vigorously until you get a smooth and homogeneous mixture. It will take some time and energy.
Then add the soft butter in cubes, a little at a time , stirring with a spatula to melt it; you can also blend with an immersion blender for a smoother texture . At this point, use your white chocolate ganache as desired .
White chocolate ganache can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, well covered, or it can be left at room temperature for 1 day.
Adjust the amount of cream based on the consistency you want to achieve; increase it for a more liquid consistency and decrease it for a firmer consistency.
