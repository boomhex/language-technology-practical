Massage the sticks to coat them evenly. Place the carrots on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, making sure not to overlap them, add some sprigs of rosemary , and bake in a preheated static oven at 430°F for 40 minutes. Once cooked, garnish with more fresh rosemary. Your baked carrots are ready to be served !
Baked carrots can be stored in the refrigerator, in a sealed container, for 3 days. Before serving, you can reheat them in the oven at a low temperature or in the microwave to maintain their texture.
They can be frozen.
For an impressive side dish use colored carrots: orange, white, yellow, and purple will make this basic recipe more refined and original!
To make sweet and sour carrots , you can add a drizzle of honey or maple syrup at the end of cooking.
