instructions:
To prepare the ricotta and jam crumble, first let the ricotta drain in a fine mesh strainer for 30 minutes. In the meantime, start preparing the base. In a bowl, pour the sugar, add the butter and work with a hand mixer for a few minutes until you get a floury mixture . Then add the eggs and vanilla extract .
Work the mixture with a spatula , then add the all-purpose flour and the sifted baking powder . Mix first with a spatula .
Continue with your hands until you get large crumbs and set aside . Move on to the filling: in a bowl, put the sugar, ricotta, and vanilla extract , then work with the spatula; the result should be a homogeneous cream .
Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper, distribute half of the dough inside and compact it with your hands until it completely covers the base of the pan .
Cover the base with half of the jam, leaving a border of about 0.5 inch , then also pour the ricotta cream . Finally, gently add the rest of the jam onto the cream .
Cover everything with the remaining dough reaching the outer edge . Bake in a static oven at 350°F for 45 minutes, until the crumble is golden brown . Let it cool completely and remove it from the pan. The ricotta and jam crumble is ready to be enjoyed!
The ricotta and jam crumble can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 or 3 days.
You can also freeze it, already portioned, and consume it within 2 months.
To flavor the crumble, instead of vanilla extract, you can use a vanilla bean or the peel of organic citrus fruits like oranges or lemons.
You can substitute the berry jam with any jam or preserve you prefer!
