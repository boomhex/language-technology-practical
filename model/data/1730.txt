instructions:
To prepare pasta with swordfish and broad beans, first shell the broad beans and gather them in a small bowl . Blanch the broad beans in boiling water for a couple of minutes , then drain them directly into a bowl filled with cold water .
Now remove the outer peel from each broad bean and set them aside. Place a pot full of salted water on the stove and bring it to a boil; this will be used to cook the pasta. In the meantime, take care of the swordfish: remove the skin and cut the flesh into regular cubes to achieve even cooking .
In a pan, heat the olive oil with the garlic clove, then add the swordfish cubes and sauté over high heat, stirring often; it will take about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the pasta, leaving it undercooked for a couple of minutes compared to the time indicated on the package . Meanwhile, flavor the fish with the grated lemon zest .
Add salt, pepper , and season with fresh mint leaves . When the swordfish is cooked and golden, turn off the heat and add the broad beans .
Remove the garlic clove and drain the pasta directly into the pan . Pour in a ladle of cooking water and sauté everything for a couple of minutes.
Stir well, finally garnish with more mint leaves and a drizzle of olive oil . Serve your pasta with swordfish and broad beans immediately !
Pasta with swordfish and broad beans can be stored in the refrigerator and consumed within the day. Freezing is not recommended.
To give the swordfish a more aromatic touch, you can deglaze it with half a glass of dry white wine.
