To prepare mint lemonade, start by removing any leaves from the lemons, if present, then rinse them, dry them, and cut them in half . To get the most juice, squeeze all the lemon halves with a juicer , then pour the juice into a container where you have placed a fine mesh strainer .
This way you'll filter the juice, preventing pulp and seeds from ending up in the lemon juice . Then pour the juice into a larger container, you should have about 15 oz , and add the sugar .
After stirring well, so that the sugar dissolves , also pour in the water and continue stirring .
Set the container aside and in the meantime, deal with the mint, so after detaching all the leaves from the stem, rinse them and dry them gently with a clean kitchen towel .
Then add them to the container with the lemon juice and let it rest for at least a couple of hours before you can sip your homemade mint lemonade !
It is recommended to consume mint lemonade quickly. If you want to store it, keep it in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
Lemonade is a classic, and adding mint will make it particularly fresh and pleasant. You can add a little more fizz by adding sparkling water or soda in the proportions you prefer. In this case, however, it is advisable to add the water at the last moment so as not to lose the fizz.
Mint lemonade is an energizing drink thanks to the vitamins, minerals, and carbohydrates present. It should not be confused with the so-called Digestive Canary , where instead the lemon peels are steeped in hot water for about ten minutes along with a bit of bay leaf, which also has soothing properties for the stomach.
