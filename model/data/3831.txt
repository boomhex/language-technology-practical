To prepare the dates filled with mascarpone and walnuts, start by pouring the mascarpone and powdered sugar into a large bowl. Flavor with cinnamon .
Enhance with rum and mix the ingredients using a hand whisk until you get a homogeneous mixture that you transfer into a piping bag equipped with a star nozzle . If you don't have a piping bag, you can also use a teaspoon to fill the dates.
Set the piping bag aside while you prepare the dates. Start by cutting them in half : repeat this operation for all the dates. Then remove the inner pits : this will give you boat-shaped dates that are ready to be filled. Take the piping bag and start filling the dates in the hollow .
Place half a walnut kernel on top of the mascarpone cream, using kitchen tweezers if you prefer . Set the walnut into the mascarpone cream . After repeating all the operations for all the dates filled with mascarpone and walnuts, place them in the refrigerator for about 2 hours to allow the cream to set better before enjoying them !
These delightful treats can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day, tightly sealed in an airtight container.
We do not recommend freezing.
Some tricks to customize your stuffed dates: in the mascarpone cream, you can replace the rum with any other liqueur of your liking! If you prefer a lighter version, you can also substitute mascarpone with ricotta and sprinkle the surface of these little boxes of goodness with cocoa! For the more indulgent, you can also replace cinnamon with cocoa: a real treat!
