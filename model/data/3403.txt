It's soft and slightly tender, which makes it a staple in the region. It's known for its moist texture and tasty salty kick. Traditionally, it's topped with coarse salt and rosemary. So, so crispy and aromatic. Sometimes, you'll even discover bits of lard or pancetta tucked inside, giving every bite a rich, almost buttery taste. And the sauce? People in Romagna love tearing off pieces to enjoy with their favorite cold cuts or cheeses. Pretty simple. It's a common sight at gatherings, or just as a snack with friends.

It’s more than just a dish; it’s a slice of Romagna’s bright culture, perfect for sharing moments and creating memories. Really, it is.
To prepare the Romagna flatbread, start by sifting the two flours into a large bowl . Place the yeast in a small bowl and add a teaspoon of malt (or sugar) and a little water (taken from the total amount in the recipe), then mix until the yeast is completely dissolved .
In the remaining water, dissolve the fine salt and 2 tbsps of extra virgin olive oil . Add the yeast mixture to the sifted flours
and mix with your fingertips to incorporate it , then also add the water, salt, and oil mixture , kneading everything carefully . Once the ingredients are well combined, continue to work the dough on a work surface for at least 10 minutes until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture.
Put the obtained dough in a bowl sprinkled with a little flour, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise for at least two hours in the oven turned off but with the light on . After the indicated time, the dough will have doubled in volume . At this point, take a baking sheet with a sheet of parchment paper and sprinkle it with 2 tablespoons of oil ,
then take the dough and roll it out with your hands . Use your fingertips to make indentations in the flatbread , then sprinkle with coarse salt (not excessively) and rosemary needles on the surface and let it rise for 30-40 minutes in the oven turned off with the light on. Bake the flatbread in a preheated oven at 390°F for about 30 minutes, until it is golden brown. Remove the flatbread from the oven and place it on a rack to prevent the sweating from making it lose its crunchiness. As soon as it is warm, cut the Romagna flatbread and serve it with cold cuts and cheeses.
Store the Romagna flatbread in a closed bag to prevent contact with air from drying it out. The Romagna flatbread can last a couple of days.
In the town of Maiolo, in the province of Rimini, during the Ferragosto period, the festival of the Romagna flatbread is celebrated for several editions, baked and enjoyed together with typical local cold cuts, cheeses, and sausages.
