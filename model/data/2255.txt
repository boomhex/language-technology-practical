Apple and grapefruit cups are, honestly, a really refreshing twist on the traditional fruit cup recipes you might stumble upon in Italy, especially up north. And look, these cups capture that perfect mix of tangy and sweet. Seriously good. The sharp, almost crisp taste of green apple teams up with the zesty punch of pink grapefruit to create a flavor that’s, well, kinda refreshing. Served in small glasses—pretty simple—they add an elegant touch to any table.
The crunch from amaretti biscuits —which is awesome—adds an exciting contrast. Every bite offers a blend of juicy fruit and crispy almond cookie. It's one of those combos that's really, really likely to spark conversation, especially when you want something light but memorable. In regions like Lombardy or Veneto, some folks might even toss in a splash of local dessert wine or a bit more citrus. For real. But, you know, the main thing is all about showing off fresh, seasonal ingredients.
These apple and grapefruit cups are not only delicious but, I gotta say, also visually stunning. With their bright layers of green and pink, they fit perfectly at a dinner party. Plus, they can elevate a regular meal into something special. Unlike heavier desserts, these cups are light enough that everyone reaches for a spoon, even after a big dinner. Pretty much. If you’re on the hunt for quick fruit recipes that offer flair, this is it.
The refreshing flavor, the bright colors, and the tender yet crunchy texture make this dessert feel both fancy and simple. It is easy to see why folks in Italy dig desserts like this when they want to impress without much fuss. Whether you’re hosting guests or just treating yourself, these cups are a sure way to end any meal on a high note. Honestly, can't go wrong.
To prepare the apple and grapefruit glasses, start with the apple puree. Prepare the syrup: pour water and granulated sugar into a pot and let it melt, it will take a minute, then turn off the heat and add the agar-agar , stir continuously to avoid lumps, and let it cool .
In the meantime, wash and dry the apples, cut them in half, and remove the core . With a melon baller, make small balls of pulp and drop them into acidulated water (to make it, just squeeze a lemon into a container with cold water) to prevent them from turning brown. In another container, collect what is left from the apples and pour it into the blender ,
add the syrup and blend until you get a smooth and homogeneous mixture . Divide the mixture into 6 glasses, filling each with about 2.8 oz of mixture . Place the glasses in the refrigerator and let them set for 30 minutes.
In the meantime, focus on the grapefruit puree, so prepare the syrup again by pouring water and granulated sugar into a small pot ; let it dissolve, then turn off the heat and add the agar-agar, stirring to prevent lumps ; let it cool. Grate the zest of ¼ of a grapefruit, collecting it in a container and storing it in the fridge for the final decoration .
To peel and segment the grapefruit: simply peel it, removing the white part as well ; from the obtained pulp you can finally remove the waste and instead keep the wedges to cut into 2 or 3 parts . Pour the cubes into the blender
and blend until you get a puree on which you will pour the now cold syrup . Let the blades run a little longer to have a homogeneous mixture . Take the glasses from the fridge and also pour the grapefruit puree (2.8 oz for each glass) onto the now set bases .
Place them back in the fridge for 30 minutes or until they are firm . Meanwhile, pour water and brown sugar into a pan and let it caramelize over high heat for 2-3 minutes .
When the mixture becomes viscous enough (you can test it with a spoon) lower the heat, drain the apple pulp balls from the acidulated water and pour them into the pan , letting them caramelize for a minute .
Crumble the amaretti by hand, then take the glasses and sprinkle them with the crumbled amaretti , then arrange the caramelized apple balls and garnish the glasses with the grated grapefruit zest you had stored in the fridge . Your apple and grapefruit glasses are ready to be served but if you want, you can garnish them with some green apple zest cut into strips .
If you like, you can store your apple and grapefruit glasses in the refrigerator, well covered with plastic wrap, for no more than one day, consisting only of the two fruit purees. You can add the caramelized apple garnishes, amaretti, and grapefruit zest when serving.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you are not too fond of pink grapefruit or want to soften the taste of the glasses, you can pair green apple with orange puree!
