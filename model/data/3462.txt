instructions:
To prepare the risotto with Castelmagno and hazelnuts, start by finely chopping the onion and let it soften in a pan with oil and butter over very low heat for about 10-15 minutes . Raise the heat and add the rice to the pan, toasting it for a minute while stirring continuously; add 2-3 ladles of broth and continue cooking by adding more broth as needed, little by little .
Meanwhile, place the peeled hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven at 392°F until they become crunchy (be careful not to burn them); let them cool slightly and then chop them coarsely. When the rice is al dente, turn off the heat, add the grated Castelmagno cheese , mix it in and cream with a knob of butter, then plate , sprinkling the plates with toasted hazelnut grains and some shavings of Castelmagno, then serve.
