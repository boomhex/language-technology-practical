instructions:
To make the water ring cake, first grate the lemon zest and set it aside . Separate the yolks from the whites, beat the latter until stiff with the beaters adding half of the sugar .
The whites must be white and foamy . Pour the yolks with the rest of the sugar into a bowl and beat them with the beaters .
You need to obtain a light and foamy mixture. At this point, pour in the oil in a thin stream and then the water , mix the batter for a few seconds, finally flavor with the lemon zest .


In a bowl, sift the flour , the baking powder, and the corn starch . Add the dry ingredients to the yolk mixture little by little, always mixing with the beaters .
Finally, fold in the beaten egg whites, first a couple of spoonfuls , mix with a spatula and then add the rest by gently folding from bottom to top. The batter is ready . Butter and flour a 9.5-inch ring mold .
Pour the batter inside and bake in a preheated static oven at 338°F for 45-50 minutes on the lower rack. Once the cake is baked, take it out of the oven , let it cool completely, remove it from the mold, and serve it with a sprinkle of powdered sugar .
Store the water ring cake under a glass dome for 2-3 days. The cake can be frozen after baking, once completely cooled.
Add chocolate chips or raisins to the batter to make the water ring cake even more delicious!
Can a beverage be used instead of water?
Water can be replaced with fruit juice while keeping the same measurements.
Can seed oil be replaced with olive oil?
Olive oil has a stronger flavor, so we recommend preferring seed oil.
Can flour be used instead of corn starch?
It is possible, but you will get a less soft cake.
The cake cracked on the surface and was undercooked inside, what did I do wrong?
Most likely the oven temperature was too high; next time lower it by a few degrees and increase the time if necessary.
Can I cover the cake with a glaze after baking to make it more delicious?
Sure, you can use a Water Glaze or a Chocolate glaze .
Can granulated sugar be replaced with brown sugar?
The same amount of brown sugar can be used.
