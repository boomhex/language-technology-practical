instructions:
Negroni Sbagliato is a beverage that embodies creativity and innovation in the art of mixology. This drink, as its name suggests, was born almost by accident: its history dates back to the 1970s when Mirko Stocchetto, a bartender at Bar Basso in Milan, accidentally replaced gin with prosecco while preparing a traditional Negroni . The result was a lighter, fresher, and more sparkling cocktail compared to the original. Thus, what could have seemed like a mistake turned out to be a happy invention that first conquered the palate of the bar's patrons and then quickly became an icon of Milan's social scene. The sweetness of the red vermouth contrasts and balances the bitterness of the red bitter, while the prosecco adds a fresh and lively touch that harmonizes the whole drink. The orange peel is not just a garnish: in fact, the slightly acidic flavor of the essential oil, sprayed on the edge of the glass, intensifies the olfactory and gustatory experience of the cocktail, leaving a pleasant and refreshing finish on the palate. The Wrong Negroni is perfect for different occasions: for an informal aperitif with friends, for an elegant cocktail party, or for a refined after-dinner drink. In short, an excellent choice for those looking for a less alcoholic alternative to the classic Negroni, without giving up that unmistakable balance between sweet and bitter.
