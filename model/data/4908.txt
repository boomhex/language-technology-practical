instructions:
Gratinated shrimps are a refined and quick appetizer to prepare. A fragrant and crunchy breadcrumbs mixture covers the shrimps arranged on shells, giving an appealing touch to the presentation of these delicious seafood appetizers. Gratinated shrimps are perfect for serving a dish that is both tasty and refined, ideal for your special occasions!
To prepare the gratinated shrimps, start by cleaning the crustaceans: shell them , leaving the tail and slit the back of the shrimp with a small knife to remove the black vein inside .
Place two shrimps in each shell , so that they fill the inside , and pour a tablespoon of white wine in each, directly on the shrimps .
Prepare the breadcrumb mixture: in a bowl, place the breadcrumbs, chopped parsley, grated Grana Padano cheese, and salt . Drizzle with a little olive oil and mix. Add the half-clove of minced garlic and mix again.
Cover each shell with one or two tablespoons of the breadcrumb mixture and finish with a drizzle of olive oil . Place the shells with the shrimps on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and bake at 350°F for about 25 minutes .
The shrimps release water during cooking, so measure the olive oil added at the end on the shell carefully: just a drizzle is enough, otherwise, the dish may become too moist. You can also cook the gratinated shrimps using the grill setting for 10-15 minutes at 390°F. If you can't find the shells, you can substitute with single-serving baking dishes.
