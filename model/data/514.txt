instructions:
To prepare the savory pie with peppers and ricotta, clean the peppers by removing the stem and seeds, then cut them into regular cubes of about 3/4 inch . Clean and slice the spring onion .
Heat a pan with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, add the spring onion and peppers , sauté for about 8 minutes. Add salt and let it cool down.
Prepare the filling: in a bowl, combine ricotta, eggs , milk , and Grana Padano .
Add salt, pepper, and mix with a whisk . Season with torn basil leaves , add the peppers .
Then drain, chop the anchovies , and add them to the filling . Mix to combine .
Line a 9-inch diameter pan with the brisèe pastry, prick the bottom with a fork , pour in the filling and level it with the back of a spoon . Bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 55 minutes: for the first 35 minutes on the middle-lower shelf, then move the pie to a higher shelf to brown, completing the cooking. Remove the savory pie with peppers and ricotta from the oven, let it cool slightly before serving .
Store the savory pie with peppers and ricotta in the refrigerator in an airtight container for a maximum of two days. The cooked savory pie can be frozen.
Instead of basil, you can use fresh oregano, marjoram, thyme, or rosemary. Instead of PDO Grana Padano, for a stronger flavor, you can add Pecorino.
