instructions:
To prepare the sandwich bread, ham, and cheese rolls, flatten the slices of bread with a rolling pin . Cut the cheese into slices slightly smaller than the bread and about 0.4 inches thick . Fill the bread with a slice of cooked ham .
Place the cheese on top and place a sheet of plastic wrap underneath, roll the slice of bread , trying to tighten the roll using the plastic wrap .
Seal the rolls on both sides by tightening the plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour. At this point, pour the egg, milk , and black pepper into a baking dish. Whisk to combine .
Dip each roll in the milk and egg mixture and then in the breadcrumbs . Heat a little seed oil in a pan and place the rolls .
Cook them for about 10 minutes on medium-high heat, turning them on each side . Transfer them to absorbent paper to dry the excess oil and enjoy the hot sandwich bread, ham, and cheese rolls .

The sandwich bread, ham, and cheese rolls can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days. We do not recommend freezing them.
We recommend turning the rolls often in the pan to ensure even cooking and achieve the gooey effect! For the filling, you can also opt for a pizzaiola version with 3.5 oz of mozzarella, 5 tablespoons of tomato sauce, and a few fresh basil leaves.
