instructions:
Clean the squid by removing the head and separating it from the tentacles with a cut near the eye . Then remove the central tooth (it will come out by squeezing the tentacles). Next, extract the transparent cartilage from the pouches .
Then remove the contents from the pockets and peel them . Then cut the pouches lengthwise with a sharp knife
to obtain fillets that will curl during cooking. Place the butter in a large pan with the oil, and once melted, add the garlic and squid, frying them for a few minutes .
Then add the wine and let it evaporate, then add the lemon juice and grated zest , and finally the chopped parsley, salt, and pepper . Let it cook for a couple of minutes and then arrange everything on a serving platter, serving the garlic and lemon scented squid immediately.
We recommend consuming the garlic and lemon scented squid as soon as it's ready, but if you wish, you can store it in the refrigerator, sealed in an airtight container, for up to one day.
In California, specifically on the beaches of Los Angeles, over 1,500 giant squid washed ashore, a common species in South America, but which normally did not venture so far north. The creatures, known by their scientific name “Dosidicus gigas”, although not adults, measured about five feet and weighed 13-15 pounds each!
Since this is a super light dish, the side dish should also be light. I usually serve it with a salad, but it's also exquisite paired with sautéed spinach and chicory, or blanched broccoli rabe: the contrast between the soft squid and the slightly crispy vegetables drives even the most sober palates wild.
