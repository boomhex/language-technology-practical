instructions:
To make spaghetti with tomato sauce , start by preparing the sauce. Pour the extra virgin olive oil in a pan with the peeled and halved garlic clove , so you can remove the core and make the scent more delicate. Cook for 2 minutes over high heat, add the peeled tomatoes and salt .
Cover with a lid and cook for at least 1 hour over very low heat: the sauce should simmer gently . Mix it from time to time. After this time, remove the garlic and pass the tomatoes through a sieve to obtain a smooth and homogeneous puree.
Pour the sauce back into the pan, turn the heat to very low and add the basil leaves . After a few minutes, turn off the sauce and keep it warm. All you have to do now is cook the pasta in plenty of boiling salted water .
Drain the spaghetti al dente directly into the sauce and stir for a few moments over high heat to mix everything together . Your spaghetti with tomato sauce is ready, all you have to do is serve it, garnished with fresh basil to taste !
You can prepare the sauce a little in advance or keep it in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days, provided it is well covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight glass container. If you prefer you can also freeze the sauce.
The long cooking time of the tomato ensures a tastier sauce. For more intense color, add a little tomato paste.
Choose Piccadilly peeled tomatoes to add even more sweetness to the sauce, or if you prefer use San Marzano peeled tomatoes!
