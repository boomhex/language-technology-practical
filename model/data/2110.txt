instructions:
To prepare the melting potatoes, first preheat the oven to 428°F (220°C) in static mode, then wash the potatoes thoroughly under cold water, making sure to remove all soil residues . Cut the potatoes with the skin on into medium-thick wedges . Finally, grate the provolone with a coarse-grained grater and set it aside.
Now take a 13.4x7.9 inch (34x20 cm) baking dish, grease the base with a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle it with part of the grated Grana Padano . Arrange the potato wedges in the baking dish with the skin side down , until the base is completely covered. Season with a drizzle of oil ,
thyme leaves , salt , and pepper, and bake in the preheated static oven at 428°F (220°C) for 40 minutes on the middle rack. After this time, remove the baking dish from the oven and sprinkle the potatoes with the grated provolone that you had set aside
and the remaining Grana Padano . Increase the oven temperature to 464°F (240°C) and bake the potatoes for another 20 minutes to melt the cheese. Your melting potatoes are ready to be served hot !
We recommend serving the melting potatoes as soon as they are ready to prevent the cheese from hardening. If necessary, you can store them in the refrigerator for up to 2 days in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
Customize the melting potatoes recipe using your favorite cheese, like Gruyere, scamorza, or fontina! If you don't have red potatoes available, you can use regular ones, taking care to remove the skin.
