instructions:
To prepare the cold pasta with arugula pesto and cherry tomatoes, first cut the cherry tomatoes in half and transfer them to a bowl. Season with oil and salt .
Add almost all the brown sugar , dried oregano , and mix .
Place the cherry tomatoes in the air fryer basket with the cut side up, add the remaining brown sugar , and cook at 320°F for 10 minutes, then increase the temperature to 360°F and continue cooking for another 10 minutes, or until they are dry and caramelized . Meanwhile, cook the pasta in abundant salted boiling water .
While the pasta cooks, you can focus on the pesto: in a food processor, combine the arugula , almonds , and pecorino cheese .
Add also the oil , garlic , and salt . Blend until you obtain a homogeneous mixture.
If desired, you can add an ice cube to maintain a bright color . Drain the pasta al dente and dress it with the arugula pesto , then add the cherry tomatoes , being careful to set some aside for plating. Mix well and plate.
Finish with coarsely chopped toasted almonds and the remaining confit cherry tomatoes . Your cold pasta with arugula pesto and cherry tomatoes is ready to be enjoyed !
The cold pasta with arugula pesto and cherry tomatoes can be stored in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for up to 2 days.
The arugula pesto can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator in a glass jar, covered with a layer of oil to prevent oxidation.
If you don't have an air fryer, you can cook the confit cherry tomatoes in a static oven at 250°F for 3 hours.
You can adjust the creaminess of the arugula pesto by adding some pasta cooking water.
