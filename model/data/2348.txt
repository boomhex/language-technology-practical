Stars and stripes jelly shots are, I gotta say, the MVPs of any summer bash. Especially when you’re going all out for a holiday like the Fourth of July. These layered jello shots really really steal the spotlight. Super fun, red, white and blue that just screams party time! Picture it: a sweet cranberry-red bottom, a silky white panna cotta layer in the middle that’s so so tender, and then that pop of blue curaçao jelly on top. And you know what? Each one’s topped with cute little sugar stars.
People love how these patriotic jello shots shake up the usual party scene. They’re part drink, part dessert—just all-around good times in a cup. Instead of the same old drinks, you get these treats you can eat with a spoon. Really good stuff. Always a moist hit on the snack table. Folks go wild for the bright colors and playful style. Especially those stars—they bring out that American flag vibe in the coolest way.
Across the U.S., you’ll spot these red white and blue jello shots at Memorial Day parties and backyard barbecues. Anywhere folks want to show some spirit. Each layer has its own thing: the tangy cranberry gelatin, the creamy white center, and that crisp blue layer. It’s a bit retro, really, and a whole lot of fun. Kind of like bringing back the best parts of childhood but with a grown-up twist. Some places mix it up with raspberry or coconut, which is great, but the look? It never changes. It’s all about those bold layers and glittery stars.
These festive jello shots aren’t just about the taste; they turn any table into something parade-ready. No question people keep coming back for seconds at every Independence Day or summer gathering. Whether you’re into holiday party drinks or just want to see something new at your next get-together, these little guys are sure to be the most colorful thing in the room. Seriously good.
To prepare the jelly shot stars and stripes, start by soaking the gelatin for at least 10 minutes in very cold water in three different bowls , you will need 4 g of gelatin for the red layer, 4 for the blue one, and 2 g for the panna cotta. Then pour the cranberry juice and strawberry syrup into a high-sided pot.
Heat over low heat and add one sheet of drained and well-squeezed gelatin . Stir with a hand whisk to dissolve it completely . When it is completely dissolved, turn off the heat and transfer it into a dosing funnel to pour about 1 oz into each glass . Alternatively, you can use a measuring cup. Transfer to the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to set.
Proceed with the preparation of the panna cotta. Pour the cream into a high-sided pot and heat over low heat. Add the sugar and whisk to dissolve it .
Add a well-drained and squeezed gelatin sheet and dissolve it until you obtain a homogeneous mixture . Turn off the heat and let the panna cotta cool slightly. Then take the glasses that you had left to set in the refrigerator and pour about 1 oz of panna cotta into each one, using the dosing funnel . Transfer the glasses back to the refrigerator to set. It will take about 2 hours.
Finally, prepare the last layer of blue jelly. Pour the soda and blue curaçao into a pot. Heat over low heat. Take the last soaked gelatin sheet, squeeze it thoroughly
and add it to the pot . With a hand whisk, dissolve the gelatin completely, then turn off the heat. At this point, transfer the mixture into the dosing funnel and pour 1 oz into each glass, now set, to create the last layer . Put it back in the fridge to set for at least 2 hours.
Once the setting time in the fridge has passed, you will have your jelly shot stars and stripes glasses. You can decorate them with 6 sugar stars each to recall the design of the American flag: take the stars with kitchen tweezers and gently lay them on top of the blue jelly layer. Now serve the jelly shot stars and stripes and… have fun!
The jelly shot stars and stripes can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of 1 week covered with plastic wrap.
Freezing is not recommended.
