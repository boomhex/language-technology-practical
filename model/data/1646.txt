instructions:
To prepare the chicken meatballs in jar cooking, start with the leek. Remove the end part where the roots are and also cut off the green part of the leaves with a knife. Then slice them into rounds
and rinse them under running water . Divide the leeks into 4 jars of 500 ml each and season each jar with a tablespoon of oil . Cook each jar in the microwave for one minute at 750 watts. Meanwhile, pour the breadcrumbs, parsley, grated cheese, and the peeled garlic clove into a blender . Blend everything and set aside.
Put the ground chicken in a bowl, add the eggs , the bread mixture , a pinch of pepper , and salt.
Add the grated lemon zest and mix everything with your hands until you get a homogeneous mixture .
Moisten your hands and form walnut-sized meatballs ; you should make 20 . Then place 4-5 meatballs in each jar .
Squeeze the lemon juice and divide it among the 4 jars . Close the jars and secure the special clips . Set the microwave to 750 watts, insert a jar, and start cooking for 5 minutes. At the end of cooking, let the jar rest closed for 15 minutes. During the rest, the cooking will finish, and a vacuum will form. In the meantime, cook the other jars. When it's time to serve the meatballs, you just need to release the lid, place the jar in the microwave, and heat it for about 3 minutes, still at 750 W.
Chicken meatballs in jar cooking can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a couple of days.
Instead of using parsley, you can flavor the meatball mixture with basil, lemon thyme, or mint.
