instructions:
To prepare the agretti nests, first clean the vegetables: remove the roots at the base , rinse the stems , and drain them. In a pan, melt butter with a clove of garlic, then add the agretti and let them flavor for a few moments over high heat.
Season with salt , pour water into the pan , cover with a lid , and cook for 10 minutes on medium heat. Once the agretti are cooked, remove the garlic and let them cool slightly.
Now shape the agretti to form 4 rings on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Grate the provolone with a coarse grater and distribute it inside the nests , keeping some aside for the final garnish. Finally, add a whole egg to each nest, pouring it gently in the center . Bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for about 10 minutes.
At the end of cooking , add the remaining cheese on top and adjust with salt and pepper: your agretti nests are ready to be served hot !
It is recommended to consume the agretti nests immediately after preparation. Alternatively, they can be stored in the refrigerator for one day in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
If you don't like sunny-side-up eggs, you can opt for a small omelette, cooked in the oven, or for hard-boiled eggs placed in the middle of the nests at the end of cooking. For an even richer version, you can add slices of cooked ham or bacon to brown in the oven along with the eggs! For a lighter version, you can replace the butter with oil and omit the cheese. If the flavor of the agretti is too strong for you, you can blanch them for a maximum of one minute in boiling water before sautéing them: in this case, slightly reduce the cooking time.
