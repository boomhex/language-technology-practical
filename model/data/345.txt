instructions:
To prepare the five-grain focaccia with figs and lard, start with the dough. In a bowl, crumble the yeast, then add the water , sugar , and mix to dissolve it .
In a stand mixer with a hook (or in another bowl), pour all the flours and the water with yeast , then start it until you get a homogeneous dough. Add the salt .
Also add the oil and knead for a few minutes. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for another 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Form a dough ball and place it in an oiled bowl, covered with plastic wrap or a cloth. Let it rise for about 2 hours, or until doubled in volume, in a warm place.
Meanwhile, wash the figs and cut them into slices about 0.2 inches thick . Drizzle some oil on a 12x16 inch tray and spread it over the entire surface . Stretch the dough using your fingertips until it covers the entire tray .
Use your fingertips to press down on the entire surface to create the typical focaccia dimples. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise again for 20-30 minutes . Distribute the sliced figs on the focaccia, pressing gently . Drizzle the surface with oil .
Add some coarse salt flakes and fresh rosemary . Bake in a preheated convection oven at 428°F for 10 minutes, placing the tray on the lower part of the oven, then move it to the top and continue baking for another 15 minutes, or until it becomes crispy and golden. Remove the focaccia from the oven and take it out of the tray, then sprinkle the surface with chestnut honey .
Cut it and garnish each slice with Colonnata lard . Your five-grain focaccia with figs and lard is ready to be served !
The five-grain focaccia with figs and lard can be stored at room temperature, wrapped in a clean cloth or in an airtight container, for 2 days. If you'd like to enjoy it warm, you can lightly reheat it in the oven before serving.
For a vegetarian version, you can omit the lard and enrich the focaccia with cheeses like gorgonzola or taleggio, which pair wonderfully with the sweetness of figs.
If you love more intense flavors, you can add a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.
