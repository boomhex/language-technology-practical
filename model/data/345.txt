Fusilli with blackberries? Now that’s a real game-changer in the world of fruit pasta dishes . It’s not your usual pasta plate. Not at all. Imagine Northern Italy’s Bergamo region, where folks really know how to mix the most fragrant local ingredients. Picture this: a sauce that looks like tomato, but wait—it’s packed with sweet blackberries that are slow-cooked until they turn into something tender and wild. Pretty cool, right? Throw in thyme, oregano, basil, and a bit of chili for a touch of heat. Chef Michele Lazzarini from Contrada Bricconi? Well, he’s really put a twist on the traditional blackberry pasta recipe . Using local herbs and a lot of creativity, he finishes the sauce with herb chimichurri and bright basil oil, giving the whole thing a super fresh kick. And the cheese? It’s ‘formai de mut’—classic Bergamo cheese—melted at the end so the sauce gets all creamy and just a little tangy. Seriously good.
And look, in Lombardy, pasta like this shows what happens when you mix tradition with new ideas. The focus on sustainability is big, so you’ll find recipes using whatever grows best in the area. This dish, for sure, really shows that off. Instead of being a heavy or overly rich meal, the berry-infused sauce keeps things moist and bright. Plus, the local cheese adds just enough depth. People who love unique pasta combinations are gonna have a blast trying this. It’s a meal that gets your taste buds curious—really curious—and excited. You get a mix of tender fusilli with the slightly sweet and herby blackberry sauce, and each bite feels a bit surprising. And the sauce? Not just another fruit pasta dish —it’s like a celebration of local flavors and modern cooking, all in one plate. If you’re looking to try something different from the usual pasta with berries, this recipe from Bergamo makes dinner feel special. Even on a regular weeknight. Plus, it’s a great way to explore the rich culinary traditions of Northern Italy. Which is great.
