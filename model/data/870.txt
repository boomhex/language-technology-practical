until smooth and lump-free . Add the oil and milk .
Mix again with the whisk and add the Grana Padano . Incorporate it by mixing .
Sift the baking powder and flour directly into the mixture. Beat with the whisk until you get a thick and smooth batter .
Add the salt and pepper . Pour in the mortadella cubes ,
the cheese, the salami , and the olives . Now mix everything with a spatula .
Take a 9.5-inch bundt cake pan, grease it with oil , and coat it with flour. Transfer the batter inside, smooth it out with the spatula , and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F on the middle rack for 30-35 minutes. Before removing your savory bundt cake from the oven, check the doneness with a toothpick. When it's cooked, take out the bundt cake and let it cool slightly before removing it from the mold and serving.
