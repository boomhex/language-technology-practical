instructions:
To prepare pasta with black kale cream, guanciale, and pecorino, first clean the black kale: remove the central ribs and roughly chop the leaves . In a pan, pour the olive oil and add the unpeeled garlic cloves .
Add the black kale and season with salt and pepper . Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the kale wilts. At this point, add a splash of water .
Cover with a lid and cook for another 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, remove the garlic , and transfer everything to a blender jug .
Add a little more water and blend until smooth and creamy . Set the cream aside and cut the guanciale into strips, after removing the rind .
Clean the pan used for the kale and heat it well, then add the guanciale . Cook over medium heat for 5-7 minutes, until the guanciale becomes crispy . Transfer it to a paper towel .
Meanwhile, cook the mezze maniche in plenty of salted boiling water . Pour the black kale cream into the same pan used for the guanciale . Drain the pasta al dente and add it to the pan .
Add part of the guanciale and stir to combine the ingredients . If the pasta seems too dry, you can add a bit of the cooking water. Plate .
Finish with a sprinkling of grated pecorino and the rest of the crispy guanciale . The pasta with black kale cream, guanciale, and pecorino is ready to be served !
Pasta with black kale cream, guanciale, and pecorino can be stored in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for 1-2 days.
For a vegetarian version, you can replace the guanciale with toasted walnuts or sliced almonds to add a crunchy note to the dish.
