Indian butter chicken is one of those dishes that just gets everything right. Really. And it’s got rich spices and tender chicken—making each bite memorable. This isn't your typical chicken curry. Nope. The butter chicken recipe involves marinating the chicken, letting it soak up all those good flavors so every bite is juicy. And super juicy.
And the sauce? That's where the magic happens. It's called makhani, and it's a dreamy mix of tomato, cream, and a touch of butter—creamy and slightly sweet, definitely different from those fiery curries like vindaloo. With authentic spices—garam masala, cumin, and a hint of chili—it gives warmth without being too spicy. Accessible to everyone. Which is great.

Arrange the chicken with its marinade on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for about 30 minutes, until golden. In the meantime, cook the basmati rice in boiling water and prepare the sauce.
To prepare the Makhani sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until golden. Add the whole spices (cardamom, star anise, cinnamon, cumin seeds) and toast them for 1-2 minutes until they release their aroma.
Add the tomato paste and stir. Then add the tomato puree and adjust with salt. If you prefer, you can also add a pinch of sugar. Cover with a lid and simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes, until the sauce thickens.
Once the rice is cooked, drain it and set aside in a bowl . At this point, the chicken will be cooked, so take it out of the oven .

Mix to obtain a creamy consistency . Plate the dish by serving the rice with the chicken alongside it , and garnish with parsley leaves. Enjoy the butter chicken piping hot! !
Butter chicken can be stored in the fridge for 1-2 days in an airtight container. When serving, heat gently, adding a tablespoon of water or cream to bring the sauce back to its original creaminess. You can also freeze the chicken (without the rice) for up to 3 months, but remember to thaw it slowly in the fridge to best preserve its texture and flavor.
To achieve a truly creamy butter chicken, we recommend adding the sour cream gradually, adjusting the consistency to your liking.
If you desire an even more velvety sauce, you can blend it with an immersion blender before adding the chicken: you'll get a smooth and silky Makhani like the ones in Indian restaurants.
For an extra touch of flavor, lightly toast the spices before adding them to the onion: they will release an irresistible aroma.
