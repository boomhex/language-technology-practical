instructions:
The cake without yeast is a simple and genuine dessert that surprises with its soft and light texture despite the absence of leavening agents. It is perfect when you want to prepare a homemade dessert but don't have yeast in the pantry or simply desire a more delicate and natural variant. The secret to obtaining a well-developed and airy cake lies in the balance of the ingredients and their combination. In particular, the use of baking soda together with vinegar gives the batter the right volume, making it soft and pleasant to bite. Yogurt plays a fundamental role: it adds moisture and a slight acidic touch that perfectly balances the sweetness of the sugar. Serve it when you want something simple yet satisfying, to enjoy at breakfast with a cup of milk or as a snack with tea. It is the perfect demonstration that even with a few ingredients, chosen well and combined with care, you can create a good homemade dessert that pleases everyone. Try our version, and let us know if yours also turned out tall and fluffy!

Continue with the vegetable oil , the flour , and the baking soda .
Finally, add the white wine vinegar . Beat with the mixer until you obtain a homogeneous batter. Pour the batter into a 20 cm (8 inches) diameter mold lined with parchment paper.
Level it and bake in a static oven at 340°F for 30-35 minutes. Let it cool, remove from the mold, and decorate with powdered sugar . Your cake without yeast is ready to be enjoyed !
The cake without yeast can be stored at room temperature, under a glass dome or in an airtight container, for 2-3 days. If you prefer, you can also keep it in the refrigerator, especially during the hot season, to preserve it longer: in this case, let it sit at room temperature for about half an hour before serving, so it regains its softness.
You can add chocolate chips to the batter to make it more indulgent, or chopped nuts like walnuts, almonds, or hazelnuts for a crunchy touch. If you love intense aromas, try flavoring it with grated lemon or orange zest, or with cinnamon, ginger, or cardamom.
