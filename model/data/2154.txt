Almond parfait —what a treat. And honestly, it's everywhere in Sicily when the weather turns warm. Super tasty and just the perfect alternative to those heavier winter sweets. Really, it’s got this super creamy texture but still light enough to enjoy after dinner. Unlike the classic semifreddo, this dessert uses the pâte à bombe technique, where egg yolks are whipped and pasteurized with sugar syrup.
And here's the thing: this method makes the almond parfait extra smooth—it stays moist and never turns icy, even after hours in the freezer. The real star? The intense flavor of Sicilian almonds, highlighted by a sprinkle of crunchy almond brittle on top. Each bite has this crispy finish that pairs beautifully with the chilled, velvety center.
In Sicily, there’s a love for nuts in desserts—no question—and this almond parfait recipe really, really shows why. It’s not just about flavor. It’s about having something refreshing for those hotter days when a heavy dessert feels like too much. Pretty simple, right? People often use it as a switch from typical comfort foods, showing how Sicilian sweets can be rich yet fresh.
Some might add modern twists, like different flavors or toppings, but the homemade almond parfait stays true to what makes it amazing: pure almond flavor, a touch of sweetness, and that tender texture that keeps you coming back for more. To be honest, for anyone seeking a healthy almond dessert with that Sicilian touch, this dish hits the mark. The almond brittle on top isn’t just decorative—it adds a bit of golden crunch that complements the sweet and nutty frozen base.
Anyone searching for a new spin on an easy almond parfait or wanting to savor an authentic taste of Sicily, look no further. Seriously good. It’s perfect when you’re ready to swap out winter treats for something more lively and tangy as the days get brighter. For real.
To prepare the almond parfait, start by making the first brittle that will be blended to be poured into the parfait. Pour 20 g of water and 40 g of sugar into a saucepan , then let them dissolve over moderate heat until reaching a temperature of 250°F . To measure the exact temperature, it is advisable to use a kitchen thermometer, but if you don't have one, you'll notice that the syrup is ready when white bubbles form on the surface. Meanwhile, slightly heat the almonds in the microwave or in a pan but without toasting them, and when the syrup has reached the temperature, pour them inside and stir continuously .
until they turn an amber color. At this point, add the butter , which will prevent the almonds from sticking together. Then pour them onto a silicone mat (or a sheet of baking paper), spread them out with a spatula and let them cool completely.
In the meantime, prepare the pâte à bombe which will serve to pasteurize the yolks. Pour the 65 g of sugar together with the 20 g of water into a saucepan and, as done previously, let it simmer until reaching a temperature of 250°F . When it reaches around 240°F, start whipping the yolks with an electric mixer, and once the syrup has reached 250°F, pour it slowly into the yolks .
Continue beating until completely cooled: you will obtain a fluffy and frothy mixture . At this point, place the now cold caramelized almonds into a blender
and blend until you get a crumbly mixture . Then pour the cream into another bowl and whip it with the mixer (make sure to clean the mixer blades well before whipping the cream) . At this point, pour the blended almonds into the pâte à bombe , mix
and also add the whipped cream little by little . Once you have a homogeneous mixture, pour it into a 7.5x3.5 inch mold , level the surface , and place it in the freezer for at least 12 hours.
About 30 minutes before serving the parfait, make the brittle for the final decoration. As done previously, make the syrup with water and sugar, bring it to a temperature of 250°F , add the almonds slightly heated in the microwave (or pan) , and stir until you get a brown color. Finally, add the butter and transfer the almonds onto a silicone mat or a sheet of baking paper.
Using a spatula, quickly shape the brittle to match the mold of the parfait (22-23) and let it cool completely. At this point, also prepare the accompanying sauce: chop the chocolate ,
pour it into a bain-marie bowl and melt it over a bain-marie . If you prefer, you can do this using the microwave, setting it for 30 seconds at a time and stirring the chocolate each time. Once ready, transfer your chocolate sauce into a sauceboat, making it easier to pour over the parfait!
Once the sauce is ready, you should immediately proceed to unmold the almond parfait; to help you, you can immerse the base for a few minutes in boiling water or pass the blade of a small knife all around the inner edge of the mold . Invert it onto a serving plate , decorate the surface with the almond brittle , and serve your parfait accompanied by the chocolate sauce!
The almond parfait can be stored in the freezer for up to a month.
Remove it from the freezer about ten minutes before serving. If it has been in the freezer for several days, it may take a few more minutes to soften slightly.
If you have almonds with skin, to peel them more easily, blanch them for a few minutes in boiling water!
