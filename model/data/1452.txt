instructions:
To make the coffee hot chocolate, start by making the coffee: you'll need about 1 oz. Then chop the dark chocolate and set it aside. Pour the milk into the saucepan along with the cornstarch , add the cocoa and sugar ,
stir and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring continuously with a whisk; it will take about 4-5 minutes. Once it has reached a boil, the chocolate will have thickened, so add the chopped chocolate . Continue cooking just long enough to melt the chocolate, always stirring .
Remove from heat and add the brandy and the coffee , stir again and your chocolate is ready.
Prepare the whipped cream with electric beaters (10-11) and place it in a piping bag, then pour the hot chocolate into glasses or cups ,
garnishing with a dollop of whipped cream and a dusting of cocoa . Serve the coffee hot chocolate with a ladyfinger !
It is recommended to consume immediately.
If you prefer, you can omit the alcoholic part.
Instead of ladyfingers, you could serve it with crumbled amaretti.
The coffee and brandy are added at the last moment so that the flavor remains intact and does not evaporate during cooking.
