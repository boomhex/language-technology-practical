Gallo pinto is a total must-have at the breakfast table in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and you know what? You'll find it literally everywhere locals hang out for breakfast. This gallo pinto recipe is about mixing black beans and rice with a splash of color and tons of comfort in every bite. It's got that moist and slightly tender texture from cooking the rice with beans, plus onions and peppers. Honestly, really tasty. Over there, folks usually pick long-grain rice like Thaibonnet because it keeps the grains nice and separate—not mushy at all. But if Basmati is all you've got, it works just fine. Really, you get that easy-to-scoop, kinda fluffy texture that makes Costa Rican rice and beans so enjoyable.
Serving up Nicaraguan gallo pinto offers lots of options, depending on when you're eating. At breakfast, it's often paired with eggs—sometimes crispy on the edges or soft inside—and maybe a side of golden bread or warm tortillas. Some folks add sour cream for a creamy kick, or even fried cheese if you want something super rich. When lunchtime rolls around, you might add fried fish or chicken, making the dish more filling—perfect for a bigger meal. Pretty much perfect.

To prepare gallo pinto, start by cleaning and finely chopping the onion . Pour the vegetable oil into a large pan (set aside a teaspoon) , then add the chopped onion .
Add half of the water and let the onion soften over low heat. Then toast the rice for a few minutes (5-6),
then drain the red beans from their preserving liquid and add 4.4 oz to the rice , along with the remaining water .
Cover and let it cook over very low heat for at least 15-20 minutes . In a small bowl, season the beans with garlic, a teaspoon of vegetable oil, and salt (11-12).
As soon as the rice is ready, turn off the heat and fluff it with a fork, then add the beans ; mix with a spatula and transfer the gallo pinto to a serving dish ! You can enjoy it on its own or accompanied with eggs, chicken, fish, or tortillas.
Store the gallo pinto in the refrigerator in a sealed container for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
If you find it, you could use Thaibonnet rice, use black beans instead of red ones, and flavor the preparation with cilantro!
The name of the dish "gallo pinto" supposedly originates from another meaning of the word gallo, namely "tortilla." Originally, the tortilla was used instead of the plate to eat. One of the legends around gallo pinto tells of a wealthy man from San José who invited many people to a local festival, sacrificing a speckled, fattened rooster he had been raising for months. But the rooster was not enough for everyone, so rice and beans were also served to satisfy the guests. This led to the ironic joke the next day in which people who attended the party asked each other, “Did you eat Don Bernabé's gallo pinto?”
