Orange and lemon marmalade brings all those zesty, sweet, and tangy Mediterranean citrus flavors right into your kitchen. We're talking about the beauty of southern Italy's winter fruits. It's not just your average breakfast spread, oh no. It’s like a celebration of regional tradition. You take a taste, and first, you get the fresh lemon notes. Then comes the deep, sweet orange that just lingers. Seriously good.
Making homemade marmalade is a thing in Mediterranean households—like, for real. Local, seasonal fruit? That's key. This citrus marmalade recipe is all about balancing that bright, sharp lemon with the gentle sweetness of orange—making it really, really different from what you get at the store.
In southern Italy, where fresh oranges and lemons are everywhere during winter, crafting fruit preserves is a source of pride. This isn’t just an easy marmalade recipe to whip up on a whim—it’s like capturing pure Mediterranean sunshine in a jar. Picture this: golden, glossy spoonfuls that taste bursting and a little tart. Perfect on toasted bread. And, you know what? It's versatile enough for desserts or filling cakes. And the texture? Unmatched. The homemade touch really boosts that real fruit flavor, creating a sticky, silky texture you won't find in mass-produced jams.
Regional variations keep it interesting: sometimes a bit more lemon for that extra bite, or maybe a hint of local honey for some moist sweetness. Whether you're spreading it on a croissant or swirling it into yogurt, this traditional marmalade makes breakfast exciting. Plus, it is a taste of Mediterranean heritage, one great spoonful at a time. Pretty much. It's not just a preserve; it's a reflection of cultural appreciation for those seasonal, homemade treats, typical in Southern European gastronomy. You are not just savoring a marmalade with each jar—you're enjoying a piece of Mediterranean tradition, lovingly preserved and shared.

To prepare the orange and lemon marmalade, first, with the help of a zester, remove the zest from the citrus fruits 1 , previously washed and dried, being careful not to take the white part which would give an excessively bitter taste to the final product. Using the specific tool, you will get thin strips; if you don't have it, you can use a peeler and then use a knife to cut the zest into strips. Put the zests in a pot 2 with water and bring to a boil. Then drain the zests 3 and repeat this process two more times, always starting with cold water.
Peel the oranges and lemons alive 4 , cut them into pieces 5 , removing all the white parts and any seeds. Put everything in a pot 6 .
Add the sugar 7 and cook, over low heat, stirring continuously, for 20 minutes or until the sugar starts to thicken 8 . Add the zests 9 and continue cooking, over medium heat, for another 10 minutes.
Do the plate test: put a teaspoon of marmalade on a plate and let it cool, if tilting it doesn't slip away then it's ready. Put it immediately in the jars 10 , previously sterilized, leaving a space of 0.8 inches from the top of the jar. Seal tightly and turn them upside down 11 . Let them cool completely and your orange and lemon marmalade is ready 12 .
Orange and lemon marmalade can be stored for 6 months in a cool, dry place, always check before consuming if the jar has maintained the vacuum seal. Once opened, it can be stored in the refrigerator for 4-5 days.
Homemade preparation of preserves and marmalades can pose health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the necessary conditions and measures to ensure the safety and suitability of the food, which industrial procedures, on the other hand, can ensure to prevent dangerous contaminations. It is therefore important to follow food safety guidelines meticulously to reduce risks, but always keep in mind that you will never achieve the same food safety as preserves and marmalades produced at a professional level. For a correct preparation of homemade preserves, refer to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
