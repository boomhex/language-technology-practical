To prepare the maltagliati with Monk's Beard, place a pot on the stove for the Vegetable broth . Proceed with the preparation of the Homemade pasta (sheets and shapes) : in a bowl, place the sifted flour, create a well in the center, and pour the eggs . Then start working the ingredients with a fork directly in the bowl (keep some warm water handy, which you can add to make the egg pasta softer and of the ideal consistency for rolling it out with a rolling pin). Then proceed to knead by hand to obtain a dough as compact as possible.
Finish kneading on a work surface to achieve a smooth and homogeneous consistency ; form a ball and wrap it with plastic wrap : the dough should rest for at least 30 minutes in a cool place, away from drafts. After the necessary time, take the egg pasta and divide it into two pieces; while rolling out the first one, keep the other wrapped in the plastic wrap. Roll out a sheet 1-2 mm thick .
Then cut into strips and cut the pasta into diamonds or any shape . Place the maltagliati on a lightly floured tray and flour them again . Then roll out the other piece and repeat the same operations.
Continue by cleaning the Monk's Beard: remove the reddish end , then wash it thoroughly under plenty of running water . Steam the Monk's Beard for about 3 minutes ,
leaving it rather crunchy . Cut the shallot into rings then also cut the smoked bacon into thin strips .
Brown the bacon in a non-stick pan until it becomes crispy and golden . Soften the shallot rings in a pan with a drizzle of oil for 10 minutes ,
adding the vegetable broth little by little . Add the Monk's Beard , season with salt and pepper ,
and add the crispy bacon, stirring with a spatula . Turn off the heat and set aside. After the necessary time, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the maltagliati in batches for a few minutes , then drain them with a slotted spoon. Pour them directly into the dressing you have prepared
and mix well to flavor, tossing for a few seconds in the pan . Plate the maltagliati with Monk's Beard and finish with grated ricotta , then serve them hot .
You can store the maltagliati with Monk's Beard for 1-2 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container. It is possible to freeze the maltagliati while raw. For freezing, you can place the tray with the already portioned maltagliati, and store them again in the freezer. When you need to use them, boil them directly from frozen in boiling water and proceed according to the recipe.
If you prefer, instead of smoked ricotta, you can use Sardinian pecorino cheese.
