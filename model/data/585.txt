To make the rice dumplings with vegetables, first cover the dried mushrooms with warm water and let them soak for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the other vegetables: cut the zucchini obliquely into rather thick slices , then cut them into strips .
Do the same with the carrots: after peeling them, cut them first into slices and then into strips . Also, slice the white part of the spring onions .
Thinly slice the spring onion stalk . Finally, drain the mushrooms, remove the stalk , and cut the upper part into strips .
Rinse the rice dumplings under running water . Meanwhile, bring some water to a boil in a wok, then add a drop of oil to prevent them from sticking together. Cook the dumplings in the boiling water and drain them after one minute .

We used fresh dumplings; if you find the dried ones, remember to soak them overnight first.
It is important that the vegetables are cut to the same size as the dumplings, to enhance the dish's flavor.
The dark soy sauce is used to color the dish, while the light one gives the flavor!
