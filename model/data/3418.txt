instructions:
To prepare the waffle sandwiches with Nutella, place the cream in a stand mixer , or in a bowl, and add the vanilla extract . Semi-whip the cream with the whisk attachment of the stand mixer , or with a hand mixer. The cream should reach a soft consistency.
In a bowl, sift together the flour and powdered sugar , add the cornstarch and the cinnamon .
Mix the dry ingredients and gradually add them to the semi-whipped cream , blending everything with a spatula: the batter should be thick . Heat the sandwich griddle and once it is very hot, pour one to two tablespoons of batter
and flatten the batter on the griddle with the back of the spoon, leaving a few millimeters of thickness . Close the griddle and check the cooking: when the batter is golden on the bottom side, flip it to brown the other side as well (11-12).
Remove the cooked batter, transfer it to a cutting board and while still warm (to avoid it hardening too much and breaking), cut out discs from the rectangle using a cookie cutter and set them aside . Finish all the batter this way and finally assemble the waffles. Spread a teaspoon of Nutella on one disc and place another disc on top . Your waffle sandwiches with Nutella are ready!
The waffle sandwiches with Nutella can be stored for 4-5 days, covered, in a cool and dry place.
The waffles require cooking exclusively between two electric plates: there are specific plates for waffles or alternatively, you can use a sandwich griddle. You can use the leftover batter scraps as wafers to accompany ice cream.
