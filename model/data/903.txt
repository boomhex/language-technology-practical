instructions:
To prepare pistachio cookies, melt the butter over low heat (or in the microwave) and let it cool slightly. Pour the sugar and the lightly beaten egg into a bowl , beat with electric whisks until you get a frothy mixture .
Add the melted butter, at room temperature, keeping the whisk at low speed . At this point, add the pistachio flour little by little , gently mixing with a spatula. Once well blended, add the all-purpose flour, the potato starch
and the baking powder, a little at a time, continuing to mix with the spatula . When the dough starts to become fairly solid, begin to work it with your hands , moving it to the workbench .
Form a dough ball , wrap it in plastic wrap , and put it in the fridge to rest for about 1 hour. After the necessary time, take the dough from the fridge and cut pieces of about 0.7 oz (20 g) with a dough scraper .
You should get about 20 pieces . Form balls with your hands . Roll the balls in powdered sugar and
place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Space them a little apart because they will puff up during baking. At this point, make a slight finger pressure on each ball to flatten them slightly. Insert a whole pistachio on each cookie and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 15 minutes, on the middle rack. Once baked, remove the pistachio cookies from the oven and let them cool to room temperature before enjoying them.
Store the pistachio cookies in a tin box or glass jar for 3-4 days. You can freeze the shortcrust dough.
The pistachio flour defines the flavor of these cookies, but if you can't find it, you can vary the taste by using hazelnut flour or almond flour.
