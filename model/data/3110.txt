If you're looking to spice up your table with something really colorful, spianate piccanti is the way to go. And look, this spicy flatbread hails from the sun-kissed regions of Southern Italy, where strong flavors are a must. What makes this dish stand out is the confettura di peperoncini—a sweet-and-hot chili jam—layered with slices of provolone piccante . This combo melts into a bite that's a little moist, a little tangy, and definitely bold on the palate. In Calabria and nearby areas, folks love to add a dusting of paprika—honestly, it enhances those fiery notes and gives the whole spianata piccante recipe a beautiful golden finish. Nothing bland here; it brings lively energy to the table, much like a classic southern Italian gathering.
In the south, this is the kind of Italian spicy bread you'll find at every celebration, especially during family gatherings or lively aperitivo hours. The mix of crispy edges and that melting, spicy filling is super super memorable. Some families even add local ingredients like spicy salami or different cheeses, making each bite unique—sometimes more tender, sometimes extra spicy. It's about creating something with character that gives your guests a really good surprise. These strong flavors? They pair perfectly with simple drinks or even a cold soda. Pretty much.
This spicy Italian flatbread disappears quickly from the table, adding a touch of southern Italian flair to any meal. With roots in Calabrian spianata traditions, you get a taste that's both rustic and full of personality—a great choice when you want to showcase a bit of southern Italian culinary spirit. Whether you're hosting a party or just want to enjoy something a little different, this dish offers a perfect blend of tradition and zest, bringing a taste of Italy straight to your home. Seriously good.
To prepare the spicy flatbread recipe, place about 1/2 tsp of pepper jelly on each tomato flatbread ; coarsely grate the spicy provolone and place a small pile on the jelly . Finish with a sprinkle of hot paprika on top . Et voilà... the spicy flatbreads are ready to heat up your buffet!
Spicy flatbreads are excellent eaten just after being made, especially because they are prepared very quickly! If you have leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to one day!
If you want to adapt the flatbreads for those who are not fans of spicy foods, just replace the ingredients with their sweet versions. For example, instead of the pepper jelly, you can use one based on Tropea Onion Jam , add mild provolone, and garnish with sweet paprika.
