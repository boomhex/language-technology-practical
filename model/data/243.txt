instructions:
To prepare ricotta and raspberry cups, first place the cookies in a food processor and blend until they become powdery. Add the softened butter and honey .
Blend again until achieving a sandy consistency . Distribute the cookie mixture at the bottom of 4 glasses with a capacity of 7 oz , level it, and let it set in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl, place the ricotta and sugar .
Add the raspberry jam and mix until you get a smooth cream. Take the glasses and fill them with the cream , then level it and place back in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the raspberry coulis: in a saucepan, place raspberries and sugar .
Cook over low heat, stirring continuously until the raspberries break down, about 5 minutes. Add the raspberry jam and stir one last time to blend the ingredients. Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer to remove raspberry seeds and let it cool completely.
Once cooled, pour the raspberry coulis into the glasses and garnish with fresh raspberries . Your ricotta and raspberry cups are ready to be served !
The ricotta and raspberry cups can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, covered with plastic wrap.
You can replace raspberries with other seasonal fruits such as strawberries, blueberries, or mixed berries.
If you want a crunchy base, you can add a handful of chopped nuts like almonds or hazelnuts to the cookies.
To make the cups even more indulgent, you can add chocolate chips to the ricotta cream!
