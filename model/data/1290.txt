Caprese meatballs —they're a fun twist on classic flavors from Campania, that super picturesque region in Southern Italy known for its fresh ingredients. Imagine, really imagine, biting into a ripe tomato filled with a chunk of fresh mozzarella . It's something special. When the cheese melts, it creates this gooey center that's just irresistible.
Now, the secret? It's the double breading—seriously good—that gives them a crispy outer layer while locking in all the moist goodness. They fry up golden and look amazing, trust me. Perfect for summer get-togethers, especially with a sweet and tangy balsamic reduction. That's why Campania's summer flavors are loved, for real.
And listen, when tomatoes are at their peak and the mozzarella is fresh, you'll want to show off these colorful tastes. Guests will love these mozzarella stuffed meatballs because, I mean, the inside stays piping hot and tender. But watch out—that first bite is something else. Unlike your usual Italian meatball recipes , this one uses tomatoes as the shell. So you get this burst of juicy flavor instead of the heavier texture of traditional meatballs.
The folks in Southern Italy? They know how to keep it light and creative, and these basil-packed tomato basil meatballs prove it. They’re fantastic for a simple meatball appetizer or even as a refreshing main dish for a summer meal. Without a heavy sauce, each ingredient shines through. The double breading? Keeps everything together, making them super easy to pick up and enjoy at parties or casual dinners.
Even if you've tried regular homemade meatballs, these are different—lighter, brighter, and honestly, a bit surprising with every bite. Friends and family will remember these long after the meal. So, get ready to bring a touch of Southern Italian creativity to your table with these bites that celebrate summer's best.
To prepare the caprese meatballs, first wash the tomatoes and dry them. Cut them in half and use a scooper to remove the pulp and seeds inside . Place a small mozzarella in the center of each tomato .
Repeat the process for all others . Place the flour in a small bowl; in another, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and in another, mix the breadcrumbs with oregano . At this point, coat each tomato first in the flour ,
then in the egg , then in the breadcrumbs , again in the egg
and finally in the breadcrumbs . Place on a tray and continue until all the tomatoes are breaded . At this point, pour sunflower oil into a pan and heat it until it reaches a temperature of 320°F.
Pour the balsamic vinegar into a small pan and heat it until reduced . It will take about 3 minutes. Once it has halved, remove it from the heat. As soon as the oil is hot, immerse the first meatball ,
and fry it for about 3 minutes , until it is golden brown. You can fry a few pieces at a time, keeping an eye on the oil temperature, which should not drop. Drain the meatballs on a sheet of paper for frying and serve them very hot , along with the balsamic vinegar reduction.
Caprese meatballs can be frozen before frying. Once fried, it is recommended to consume the caprese meatballs immediately.
Instead of small mozzarella, you can use buffalo mozzarella.
