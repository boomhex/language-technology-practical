Mix well until you obtain a homogeneous mixture . Let it cool. In the meantime, crack the eggs, separating the yolks from the whites .
Add two yolks first , stir to mix , and finally add the last yolk . Stir again and let it cool completely.
In the meantime, start beating the egg whites and stop when they are semi-whipped . Add a portion of the cheese mixture and stir , then add the rest of the mixture and gently fold from bottom to top .
Pour everything into the ramekins with a base diameter of 3 inches, 3.5 inches at the top, and a height of 2 inches, previously buttered and sprinkled with grated Parmesan . Bake in a preheated static oven at 320°F for 10 minutes, then, without opening the oven, increase the temperature to 390°F in fan mode, and continue baking for another 10 minutes.
