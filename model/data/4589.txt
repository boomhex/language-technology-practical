Chicken with cream is an irresistible main course, perfect for those who love enveloping flavors: tender pieces of meat immersed in a silky, velvety sauce that makes every bite a unique pleasure! What's the secret to perfect chicken with cream? Of course, it's the sauce... that's why we decided to prepare a special béchamel made with cream instead of milk, to enhance the delicacy of the chicken breast and give it that touch of softness that makes it super inviting. For a more intense flavor, we also decided to enrich it with leeks and champignon mushrooms! Ideal for a family dinner, chicken with cream will conquer everyone with its creamy delicacy.

To prepare chicken with cream, start with the leek: remove the ends, then cut the first 2 layers and remove the outer leaves . Cut the leek in half and slice it into thin rings . Move on to the mushrooms: remove the earthy base .
Gently rub the mushrooms with a damp towel to remove the dirt , then cut them into quarters or more parts depending on their size . Finally, chop the rosemary .
Clean the chicken breast by removing bones and cartilage, then cut it into cubes about an inch (2.54 cm) in size . Dredge them well in flour and shake off the excess before tossing them into a pan with hot oil .
Seal the chicken pieces over high heat, stirring occasionally , then lower the heat slightly and add the leeks and mushrooms .
Add the chopped rosemary and salt and cook for about ten minutes, stirring often . Meanwhile, prepare the béchamel: heat the cream in a saucepan while melting the butter in another saucepan . Once melted, add the flour .
Quickly stir with a whisk until you get a smooth roux , then pour in the hot cream and stir until it starts to slightly thicken .
Add the béchamel to the chicken and cook for a couple more minutes to mix everything well . Your chicken with cream is ready, serve it immediately !
Chicken with cream can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
If you prefer, you can replace the cream with milk, slightly increasing the flour amount to achieve a similar velvety consistency. Alternatively, you can use chicken broth for a richer, more intense flavor.
Instead of rosemary, you can season with thyme.
