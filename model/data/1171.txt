instructions:
To prepare the pistachio meat rolls, first salt the slices of meat and then drizzle them with a bit of extra virgin olive oil . Then prepare the filling. Put the spreadable cheese in a bowl and add the chopped pistachios .
Season with a pinch of black pepper and stir to blend the mixture . Now take a slice of meat, lay it flat on a plate, and fill one side with a heaping teaspoon of the cream .
Roll the slice of meat to create the roll . With the given quantities, you will get 12 rolls .
Make the breading: in a bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, chopped pistachios, and minced garlic clove , season with salt and pepper. Roll all the rolls in the breading , ensuring they are entirely covered .
Place the rolls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over the top and bake the pistachio meat rolls in a preheated oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes. Once cooked, remove the tray from the oven and serve the rolls hot .
The pistachio meat rolls can be stored for a couple of days in the fridge in an airtight container.
Ensure the meat slices are thin; otherwise, pound them with a meat tenderizer.
