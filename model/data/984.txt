instructions:
To prepare the mushroom meatballs, start by cleaning the pleurotus mushrooms: remove the base of the stem which is more earthy, then with a brush or cloth, remove any remaining dirt . Cut the mushrooms into small cubes . In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil with the garlic .
Add the mushrooms and cook them for about 4-5 minutes over low heat, salt, pepper, and flavor with thyme leaves . After the cooking time, remove the garlic and let cool.
In the meantime, prepare the sauce: in a pot, heat a swirl of oil with the garlic clove. Pour the tomato puree , add the basil leaves , salt, and cook over low heat covered with the lid .
Now remove the casing from the sausage and place it in a bowl, also add the cooked mushrooms , grated cheese , breadcrumbs ,
the egg and some thyme leaves . Mix with your hands to combine everything. Take about 1 oz of mixture and form a meatball .
With these quantities, you will get about 20 meatballs, place them on a tray as you go . In a non-stick pan, heat a drizzle of oil and brown the meatballs to seal them .
Cook on both sides to brown them . Meanwhile, the sauce will be ready, remove the garlic clove . Gently take a meatball with a spoon or spatula.
Transfer it into the pot with the sauce . At this point, do not use wooden spoons but shake the pot to mix the meatballs with the sauce well, so they won't break apart. Cook for 4-5 minutes over low heat . The mushroom meatballs are ready to be enjoyed .
You can store the meatballs in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 2-3 days. You can also freeze them either cooked or raw: in this case, it is very important that the ingredients are fresh and not thawed.
As an alternative to cooking in sauce, you can try frying the meatballs by first breading them with egg and breadcrumbs, thus obtaining a tempting variant, perfect to propose for an appetizer!
