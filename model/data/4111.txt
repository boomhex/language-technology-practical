We recommend consuming the Hugo Spritz immediately.
For a truly refreshing and aromatic Hugo Spritz, use high-quality elderflower syrup and do not overdo the quantities so as not to overpower other flavors. Choose a well-chilled prosecco , extra dry or brut, so the cocktail will be balanced and not too sweet. Complete with freshly mint leaves lightly crushed between the hands to release the essential oils and a thin slice of lime, which adds a lively citrus touch. If you dare, try adding a few drops of angostura for a deeper, spicier note.
