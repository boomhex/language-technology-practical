instructions:
To prepare spaghetti with pea cream, asparagus, and mussels, start with the pea cream: shell the peas , then blanch them in salted boiling water for 2 minutes .
Drain the peas and immediately transfer them into ice water to stop the cooking and keep the color vibrant . Pour them into a jug and add water .
Salt and blend until smooth and velvety . Set aside the pea cream.
In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil with a clove of garlic and a piece of fresh chili . Add the cleaned mussels , raise the heat, cover with a lid , and cook for about 5 minutes.
When the mussels are all opened , shell them and set aside . Now cut the asparagus into thin rings , after removing the toughest part of the stalk, and split the tips in half.
In a pan, heat another drizzle of oil with a clove of garlic , then add the asparagus and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in plenty of salted water , draining them a couple of minutes before the end of cooking.
Pour a couple of ladles of pasta water into the pan , then drain the spaghetti here and bring to cooking. Off the heat, add the pea cream .
Add the shelled mussels and a drizzle of oil to mix. Stir well and serve the spaghetti with pea cream, asparagus, and mussels immediately !
We recommend consuming the spaghetti with pea cream, asparagus, and mussels immediately.
