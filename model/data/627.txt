instructions:
To make the pasta with asparagus pesto and speck, start by preparing the asparagus pesto: remove the woodier ends and peel the remaining part of the stalk . You will need about 7.75 oz (220 g) of cleaned asparagus in total. Blanch the asparagus in salted water for about 10 minutes .
Drain the asparagus, pat them dry with a cloth, and cut them into pieces . Pour the almonds into a mixer and coarsely chop them, then add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano PDO and Pecorino and blend for another moment.
Add the asparagus along with a few drops of lemon juice and the oil .
Season with salt, pepper , and nutmeg and pulse until you get a rustic and creamy pesto .
Now cut the speck into strips and brown it in a pan with a drizzle of hot oil until crispy . In the meantime, bring a pot of water to boil to cook the pasta.
When the water has reached a boil, salt it and add the pasta . Drain the pasta al dente, keeping some of its cooking water aside, and transfer it to the pan with the speck , then add the asparagus pesto .
Add a couple of tablespoons of the cooking water and mix well to combine the pasta with the sauce . Your pasta with asparagus pesto and speck is ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the pasta with asparagus pesto and speck immediately.
The asparagus pesto can be stored in a glass jar in the refrigerator for 4-5 days, making sure to cover the surface with a layer of oil.
You can boil the pasta in the asparagus cooking water.
For a more intense asparagus pesto, add a clove of garlic with the germ removed!
