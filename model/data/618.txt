instructions:
To prepare the Savory mini strudels with artichokes, potatoes, and speck, start with the strudel dough: in a bowl, add the flour, the egg , the water , the oil , and a pinch of salt.
Knead by hand until you obtain a homogeneous dough , then transfer it to the work surface, cover it with the same bowl, and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature . Clean and slice the shallot .
Peel and cut the potatoes into small 1/2 inch cubes . In a pan, add a drizzle of oil , add the shallot , and let it wilt for 2/3 minutes.
Add the potatoes and cook for 5 minutes. Then also add the artichokes and season with rosemary .
Cover with the lid and cook for 10 minutes on low heat. Salt and pepper . Thinly slice the artichokes .
Cut the speck into strips . In a bowl, add the sautéed vegetables, speck , and grated cheese .
Mix to combine . Roll out the dough on a dish towel first with a rolling pin and then use your hands to stretch it so that it is very thin . Brush the surface with oil .
Place the filling on the 4 sides , then cut 4 rectangles around the filling . Fold over one edge of the dough .
Wrap all the filling to create a bundle . Cut the excess dough on the edge and press it to seal it .
Brush the surface with oil and sprinkle with sesame and poppy seeds. Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 20 minutes or until golden. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before serving the Savory mini strudels with artichokes, potatoes, and speck.
The mini strudels should be consumed as soon as possible, but you can store them in the refrigerator for 2-3 days in an airtight container.
The speck will add a salty note to the filling, so do not oversalt the mixture.
