Daniel Canzian, a young chef who was a student of Marchesi and now runs his eponymous restaurant in Milan, has prepared for us one of the signature dishes of his culinary philosophy: stuffed gnocchi with creamed salt cod. This recipe revisits the flavors of Venetian tradition in an original, simple, and refined way, without ever losing sight of the quality of the raw ingredients. In this case, the star is the creamed salt cod , the famous appetizer from Venetian cuisine, which is used to fill soft potato gnocchi in a maxi format, with a crispy and golden crust. Even the “sughet” on which the gnocchi are placed recalls the dressing of another classic from this region, the bigoli in anchovy sauce. Yes, because according to Canzian, it is precisely through reinterpreting regional recipes that we can enhance our territory and local products. All that's left is to taste his stuffed gnocchi with creamed salt cod and be inspired by their goodness!

To prepare the stuffed gnocchi with creamed salt cod, start with the creamed salt cod: place the already soaked salt cod in a pot , then add the garlic cloves and the sprigs of rosemary, which you will have tied together in a bundle with kitchen string .
Cover with water , bring to a boil, and let boil for about an hour . After this time, drain the salt cod , being careful to preserve the cooking water, and let it cool slightly.
Remove the skin and break the warm salt cod meat into pieces with your hands , then transfer it to a blender and blend to chop finely .
Now transfer the chopped salt cod to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment , set it to medium-low speed, and drizzle in the vegetable oil, as if making mayonnaise . If necessary, add a bit of the salt cod cooking water .
Adjust with salt and pepper and mix everything together again . You should achieve a creamy consistency . Transfer the creamed salt cod to a piping bag without a nozzle and set aside.
Proceed to the potatoes for the gnocchi: wash and wrap each potato in a sheet of aluminum foil , twisting the ends like a candy, then place them on a baking tray and bake in a preheated static oven at 266°F for an hour ; the time may vary depending on the size, if they are still hard, extend the cooking until they reach a soft consistency. After this time, open the foil and continue baking for another 10 minutes, uncovered .
In the meantime, focus on the anchovy sauce: pour the milk into a saucepan and let it reduce by 50% on the stove. At this point, transfer the milk to a jug and add the anchovies .
Start blending with an immersion blender while drizzling in the oil . Taste and adjust with a few drops of lemon juice and possibly a pinch of salt. Blend again to achieve a smooth and creamy sauce , then set aside.
When the potatoes are ready, mash them while still hot on the work surface . Add the flour and the egg yolks little by little .
Knead with your hands and adjust the amount of flour based on the consistency of the mixture ; you should obtain a soft and homogeneous dough . Finally, salt and knead again to incorporate the salt evenly. Divide the obtained dough into smaller portions .
Form rather thick logs and cut them into pieces , then round each piece to form balls .
Gently flatten the dough balls and place a dollop of creamed salt cod in the center . Close the dough around the filling .
Pass the gnocchi between your palms to round them again and seal the filling inside . Finally, score them with a fork or a gnocchi board, always taking care to dust the surface with flour.
You are ready to cook: bring a pot of salted water to a boil and gently immerse the gnocchi . In the meantime, trim the zucchini and cut it into very thin slices . Drain the gnocchi as soon as they rise to the surface, about 4-5 minutes .
In a pan, flavor some oil with 2 unpeeled garlic cloves, then add the gnocchi and zucchini . Sauté for a few minutes, turning the gnocchi on both sides .
When the gnocchi are nicely golden, place a slice of crispy zucchini on each one, using kitchen tongs . Plate by spreading the anchovy sauce as a base and placing the gnocchi with zucchini on top : your beautiful stuffed gnocchi with creamed salt cod are ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the stuffed gnocchi with creamed salt cod immediately after preparation.
The creamed salt cod can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days, in an airtight container.
If you wish, you can add a garlic clove to the milk for the anchovy sauce to achieve a more pronounced flavor!
The amount of flour needed for the gnocchi depends on the wateriness of the potatoes; it is not possible to prepare them in advance as the potato-based dough tends to absorb the flour.
