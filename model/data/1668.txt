Venere rice and swordfish cups blend the rich tradition of Italian seafood dishes with a modern twist—color and taste in perfect harmony. Really good stuff. This appetizer is a real showstopper at any gathering, thanks to the dramatic look of venere rice —that jet-black, aromatic whole grain. It’s a total standout on the plate. Folks in Italy love using this rice for both hot and cold dishes, and it really shines here with its nutty fragrance and satisfying tender bite.
So here's the thing: the rice gets layered with a creamy green sauce. It's got a bit of spice and herby flavor, making each spoonful a little adventure. The star of the dish, though, is the swordfish —no question. And it’s cut into small cubes and tossed with fresh lemon and mint. For real, this brings out a fresh, almost zesty taste that works way way better with the richness of the rice.
Imagine seeing these swordfish cups served in clear little bowls; makes you want to dive in. The black and green layers look super cool together, and the smell coming off the rice and swordfish is just inviting. People into black rice recipes or searching for smart party starters will love this for sure. Plus, since it’s all about good seafood and whole grains, you get a dish that feels kinda fancy but still pretty healthy.
Italians sometimes follow this with honey-glazed salmon for a meal that keeps those refined flavors going all night. Pretty much. And listen, there are all sorts of ways you could riff on this—like swapping in different herbs for the cream or even adding a sprinkle of orange zest for more bright flavor. Whether you serve it at a casual gathering or a special dinner, these venere rice appetizers aren’t just about looking cool on the table; they really really deliver a moist, flavorful bite that’ll get people talking.
This dish is perfect for those who want something unique and a little bit indulgent. I gotta say, it is a memorable culinary experience.
To prepare the Venus rice and swordfish cups, first of all, pour the rice into plenty of salted water and cook for about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, peel the ginger and cut it into coarse pieces , then clean the leek and cut it into rings .
Heat a drizzle of oil in a small saucepan and sauté the leek and ginger for a few minutes (4-5). Transfer the sauté into a tall and narrow glass, add the basil leaves which you have previously washed and dried
and the 2 tablespoons of oil . Blend with an immersion blender until a smooth and homogeneous consistency is obtained , then adjust the salt .
Now move on to preparing the swordfish steak: remove the skin and cut it first into strips and then into cubes .
Heat a drizzle of oil in a saucepan, add the swordfish cubes and sauté them for about 5 minutes over high heat, seasoning with grated lemon zest , salt, and pepper .
When the rice cooking time is up, drain it and transfer it into a bowl, then season it with a drizzle of oil and a grind of pepper and mix well. At this point, you can assemble your appetizer: we used glass cups with a diameter of 2.5 inches. Place a first layer of Venus rice at the base ,
cover with a teaspoon of leek and basil cream and add a few swordfish cubes , then finish with another layer of Venus rice .
