Cover with plastic wrap and set aside until cooking. Now prepare the tomatoes: after washing and drying them, cut them into wedges and then dice them . Clean and chop the red onion .
In a bowl, combine the tomatoes and onion . Now cut the avocado in half, score the flesh vertically and then horizontally to obtain cubes . Add the avocado to the bowl .
