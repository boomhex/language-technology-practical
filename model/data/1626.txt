instructions:
To prepare the chestnut salad, start with the croutons: slice the bread and then cut it into small cubes . Move to the stove and heat a pan with 1 tablespoon of oil .
While these brown in the pan, add the crushed chili pepper and let it toast for a few more minutes, stirring occasionally. Once ready, set them aside . In the same pan, add the second tablespoon of oil, and then toss in the pre-cooked chestnuts .
Let them sauté for 4-5 minutes until they are golden, then set these aside as well . Move on to the dressing for your salad. In the bowl of a blender, pour in the lemon juice , then the whole grain mustard ,
the honey , and blend everything with the mixer to obtain your sauce (11-12).
Finally, cut the Roquefort into pieces, wash and dry the red chard leaves well. Proceed to plate composition : add the salad, garnish with bread croutons , the cheese ,
the chestnuts , and the dressing . Mix everything well and your chestnut salad is ready: enjoy your meal !
Once ready, the chestnut salad should be consumed immediately; otherwise, the red chard leaves and the bread will lose their texture. Therefore, any form of storage is not recommended. At most, you can prepare the dressing in advance and keep it in the fridge before use.
Add sun-dried tomatoes and a mix of green and black olives to make your chestnut salad even tastier, or some dried fruit. Instead of Roquefort, you can use Gorgonzola! Instead of mustard, prepare a Greek yogurt dressing with Tabasco and chives.
