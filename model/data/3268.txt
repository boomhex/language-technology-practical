When it comes to American desserts , the berry cobbler is a standout favorite. Seriously, it's a classic. Originating from American and British kitchens, this treat combines juicy red berries with a sweet, crumbly topping that’s just hard to resist. What makes this version unique—really unique—is the addition of pomegranate. It offers a tangy twist that perfectly complements those traditional sweet flavors. Unlike some cobblers with a thick, doughy crust, this one bakes to a crispy finish on the outside while staying moist underneath. So good. The result? A mixed berry cobbler that's easy for a casual dinner yet impressive for special occasions.
Enjoying cobbler warm is the best way to savor its tender, jammy fruit and let the flavors shine. Plus, pair it with a scoop of quality ice cream. Oh, the contrast! It melts over the hot berries and crispy topping, creating a really really good mix of temperatures and textures. Honestly, this easy berry cobbler recipe is perfect for gatherings, especially during summer when berries are everywhere. You’ll find various regional twists—some with denser dough, others with lighter batters, and even versions featuring a single berry type. This particular mix of red fruits and pomegranate not only enhances the flavor but also adds a colorful pop.
Whether you call it a traditional berry cobbler or just a convenient way to use up fresh berries, it’s a dessert that feels homemade and comforting every time. With its single-serve portions, it’s easy to share after dinner or pack for a picnic. Which is great. So, whether you're enjoying a casual family meal or hosting a get-together, this cobbler is sure to be a hit with everyone. No question.
To prepare the red fruits cobbler, mix the all-purpose flour, sugar, and baking powder in a bowl, using a whisk (1-2). Add 1/2 cup (120 g) of softened butter in pieces
and start working the dough with your hands , until obtaining a sandy texture (if you wish, you can do this using a mixer). At this point, gradually add the milk and mix vigorously with a whisk to obtain a smooth batter , then flavor with grated lemon zest.
Now clean the pomegranate, cut it in half and deseed it well , then add the juicy seeds to the red fruits in a bowl, mixing everything together .
Cut the remaining butter into pieces (about 1/3 cup or 80 g), place it in the cocottes, and melt it in the microwave (if you don't have one, you can melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat and then pour it into the molds). Now place about 1/3 cup of batter at the bottom of each cocotte , add 1/2 cup (50 g) of red fruits
and cover again with a tablespoon of batter , until all the fruits are covered. Place the cocottes on a baking tray and bake everything in a preheated oven at 350°F (180°C) for 45 minutes, or until the surface is golden . When ready, serve the red fruits cobbler warm.
Store the red fruits cobbler in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for 2-3 days at most. Freezing is not recommended
If you like, you can replace the red fruits with any other fruits of your liking. You can optionally flavor the cobbler with some liquor or orange zest. If you prefer, you can make a single cobbler in a 9-10 inch (22-24 cm) pan, keeping the same amounts.
