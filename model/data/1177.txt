Gratin rolls with potatoes, or potato gratin rolls , are really something special from Northern Italy. Especially popular in Trentino-Alto Adige , where speck is the go-to ingredient. Picture this: thin slices of chicken wrapping around a creamy mix of cheese and speck. Seriously good. You get that classic "filante"—or super gooey—cheese pull Italians love.
Here's the deal: these rolls are coated in a crispy breadcrumb layer before they hit the oven. The golden crust? Perfectly complements the tender filling. It’s the best of both worlds. And those moist potatoes on the side? They soak up all the juices and flavors. So so delicious. Everything bakes together into this comforting dish.
This gratin potato rolls recipe works great for entertaining friends or a special family meal. And look, it feels fancy but is pretty simple to make. Across the north, folks might try different cheeses or swap in ham for speck. Thing is, keep it simple and let the savory filling shine.
Cut into a roll, and the cheese oozes out, mingling with the potatoes—delivering that tender Italian comfort food vibe. These cheesy potato rolls really prove how homemade food can be both easy and super satisfying. The breadcrumb coating locks in moisture, while the potatoes become soft and full of flavor from the meat and cheese.
Some people sprinkle a bit of herbs or Parmigiano to enhance the taste. But you don’t need to get too fancy. Honestly, the baked potato gratin and chicken rolls combination covers all the bases—protein, potatoes, and tons of flavor. It feels warm and welcoming. And here's the thing: despite its impressive look, it's something you can whip up without much fuss. Friends and family usually go back for seconds. If there are any leftovers—big if—they heat up beautifully. Perfect for any occasion.
To prepare the gratin roll-ups with potatoes, first peel the potatoes. Wash them well, dry them, and cut them into cubes . Transfer them to a bowl, season with salt and oil . Add the breadcrumbs .
Flavor with rosemary needles . Mix everything and transfer into a rather large greased baking dish .
The potatoes should not overlap too much . Bake them in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the roll-ups: first, remove the rind from the cheese , cut out 8 sticks .
Lay the first thin chicken slice on the cutting board. Add a pinch of salt, place a slice of speck on top , and at the beginning, a stick of cheese . Roll up the meat to create a roll-up .
Repeat this operation for all the chicken slices and as soon as you have formed all the roll-ups, pass them one at a time first in the egg and then in the breadcrumbs , making sure to cover the ends well.
Set aside the roll-ups and once the 30 minutes have passed, remove the baking dish with the potatoes from the oven and place the roll-ups inside . Bake again for another 20 minutes all together. Remove from the oven and serve your gratin roll-ups with potatoes still hot!
The gratin roll-ups with potatoes can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.
Instead of speck, you can use prosciutto crudo or even cooked ham. Instead of fontina, you can use any other stringy cheese.
