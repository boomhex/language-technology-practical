To prepare the puff pastries with sausage crumbles, crumble the sausage with your hands and brown it in a non-stick pan with two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil for a few minutes over high heat (2-3).
Add the fennel , mix thoroughly, and continue cooking for a couple more minutes at most. Now take the pastries and garnish them with a teaspoon of fennel sausage : your puff pastries with sausage crumbles are ready !
We recommend consuming the puff pastries with sausage crumbles immediately, but if you wish, you can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to one day.
If you love spicy or want a more "zesty" finger food, we suggest adding some chili powder or hot or sweet paprika to the fennel! Remember, if you want to avoid a greasy outcome, don't overdo the oil when browning the sausage in the pan!
