Cake pops are all about having a blast in the kitchen. Perfect for birthday parties, holiday gatherings, or any time you want something playful and sweet. You start with bits of sponge cake or even leftover cake. Really good stuff. Then, you mix them with jam, Nutella, or mascarpone. This creates little moist balls—just the right size to eat in one or two bites. Can't go wrong. Next, dip these balls into melted chocolate. Pick from creamy white, dark, or milk chocolate. Before the chocolate sets, get creative with cake pop decorations —like colorful sprinkles, grated coconut, or chopped hazelnuts. They look like candy on a stick. Seriously good. Hard to resist sneaking one before serving. No wonder this cake pop recipe is a hit at kids’ parties. Everyone loves the sweet outside and the soft inside.
Picking toppings and flavors is half the fun. You can see people getting creative with their cake pop ideas . Some opt for rainbow sprinkles for a real party vibe. Others might drizzle more melted chocolate or add a dusting of coconut. For real. Something extra tender and fancy. You can use different cake pop ingredients for the base—chocolate cake, vanilla, or even red velvet if you’re feeling bold. The gooey center mixed with Nutella or jam makes every bite a mix of sweet and a bit tangy if you use fruit. And look, that’s why these easy cake pops are super popular as homemade gifts. Wrap a few with ribbon, and they look special—like, for sure. Making them involves mostly mixing, dipping, and decorating. Turns it into a fun group activity for families, friends, or even kids who want to help. No matter how you decorate them, knowing how to make cake pops means you’ll always have a cute treat ready for any celebration.
To prepare the cake pops, start by obtaining 400 grams (14 oz) of Sponge cake , alternatively, you can use our 7 Jar Cake Chocolate cake or use leftover cake or packaged snacks (like pound cake). Crumble the cake with your fingers, removing the crust if it is too dry, and place the crumbs in a bowl . At this point, add about 4 tablespoons of your favorite jam (one at a time) , kneading with your hands until you get a dough compact enough to form "little balls." I recommend adding the first two tablespoons of jam, knead, and then, only if necessary, add a third or possibly a fourth tablespoon. Shape the dough into balls slightly smaller than a walnut, place them on a sheet of parchment paper, and let them firm up in the freezer for about half an hour .
Melt the dark and white chocolate in a double boiler or microwave (in two separate containers). Get some plastic lollipop sticks (or wooden sticks if you can't find them) and skewer the cake balls that you have removed from the freezer . Immediately after, dip the balls into the chocolate (dark or white) completely covering them. Then allow the excess chocolate to drip off by gently shaking the cake pops .
Then, if you want, coat them with shredded coconut, chopped hazelnuts, or colored sugar sprinkles (7-8) and let them dry by sticking the sticks into a styrofoam base . You can also cover the cake pops with dark chocolate and then create contrasting streaks with white chocolate (or vice versa). For a crunchier chocolate coating, I recommend storing the cake pops in the refrigerator.
We recommend eating the cake pops as soon as they're ready, but if you prepare them in advance, you can store them in the refrigerator for a few hours before consuming or gifting them.
To mix the sponge cake, you can use not only your preferred jam but also other creams, like hazelnut spread, mascarpone, or sweetened cream cheese.
