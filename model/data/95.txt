To prepare the crystal dumplings, start with the dough: in a bowl, pour the wheat starch and cornstarch . Mix the powders with chopsticks (or a spoon), then slowly pour in the boiling water . Once all the water is absorbed, knead by hand .
Transfer the dough to a work surface and continue kneading until it becomes smooth and elastic; this step requires a lot of energy because the dough is quite tough . Form a ball, place it in the bowl, and cover with plastic wrap . Let it rest for 5 minutes, then incorporate the lard, which will give the dough more elasticity .
Form the dough into a ball again, place it back in the bowl , and brush the surface with sesame oil to keep it hydrated . Cover with plastic wrap and set aside while you prepare the filling. Finely chop the cleaned shrimp with a knife .
You should obtain a very fine mince . Transfer the shrimp to a bowl, then add the ground pork and half a chopped scallion .
Now season with grated ginger , soy sauce, oyster sauce , and sesame oil .
Also add some ground white pepper and a pinch of salt. Mix well to combine the filling . Now take the dough to form the dumplings: take pieces weighing about 20 g (0.7 oz) for each dumpling . Cover the rest of the dough with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.
Roll out the dough ball by applying light pressure with the side of your palm: the disc should be thinner at the edges so that the thicker center won't crack during cooking. Lift the disc from the work surface with a scraper, then fill the center with a teaspoon of filling . Fold it in half, aligning the two edges .
Pinch the edges firmly at the center , then close the dumplings, slightly pleating the edges as you seal , to create a wavy pattern . With these quantities, you'll get about 16 dumplings.
Prepare the steamer basket, line it with a sheet of parchment paper with small holes, and place the dumplings . Cover with the appropriate lid and steam for 8-10 minutes . Serve your crystal dumplings with soy sauce !
The crystal dumplings can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
For best results, it's advisable to reheat them in a pan with some water to keep them soft and flavorful. If not consumed within that period, they can be frozen (either before or after cooking).
Crystal dumplings can be filled with a mixed vegetable filling, such as mushrooms, spinach, and tofu, for a tasty vegetarian version. For a more aromatic taste, try a filling based on Chinese cabbage, scallion, and a pinch of ginger.
