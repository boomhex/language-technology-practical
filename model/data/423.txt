To prepare blue crab spaghetti, first, place a pot full of water on the stove. Once it reaches a boil, immerse the crabs and let them cook for 5 minutes . Then drain them .
Immerse them in a bowl with ice water . Meanwhile, in a pan, prepare the sauté with garlic, oil, and parsley stems . Let it flavor and add the canned cherry tomatoes .
Season with salt and pepper. Cover with a lid and let cook for 30 minutes. At this point, retrieve the crabs. Break the shells using scissors .
Gradually collect the meat in a bowl . Then put a pot full of water on the stove, salt to taste, and cook the spaghetti. Once the sauce is ready, remove the garlic and parsley stems .
Add the crab meat and cook for another 2 minutes to let the flavors blend. Drain the spaghetti al dente and transfer them to the pan . Toss them .
Drizzle with a little oil , add the chopped parsley , and mix again. Serve hot on plates and enjoy your blue crab spaghetti!
We recommend consuming the spaghetti immediately; alternatively, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.
If the crabs are very large, increase the cooking time by a few minutes. Blanching them too little could make it difficult to extract the meat.
You can enrich the spaghetti by adding fresh chili pepper to the sauce sauté or during cooking.
