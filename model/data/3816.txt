To begin preparing the Vichyssoise cream, wash and peel the potatoes, peel the onion, and cut off the green part of the leeks, keeping only the white part, then finely chop these ingredients.
Place the butter in a pot and let it melt, then add the finely chopped onion and leeks; let the vegetables wilt without coloring them for at least 10-15 minutes, covering with a lid.
Continue preparing your Vichyssoise by adding the chicken broth and finely chopped potatoes to the pot, then salt and pepper to taste, mix everything, and cook over low heat for at least 30 minutes, covering the pot with a lid.
Once cooked, remove the mixture from the heat and blend everything with a mixer;
add the milk, cream, and grated nutmeg, adjust the salt if necessary, and transfer the Vichyssoise cream to a container to cool to room temperature, then place it in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.
If desired, before placing the Vichyssoise cream in the refrigerator, you can strain it to make it even smoother and finer on the palate; you can also decide to serve it accompanied by golden croutons in butter and, as a variant to chives, with a watercress cream and chervil leaves.
