instructions:
To prepare the befanini, start by placing the flour and well-chilled butter in a mixer . Turn on the device and blend everything until you get a sandy mixture , which you will then transfer onto a work surface, in the classic fountain shape with a hole in the center .
Now add the sugar , the baking powder , the seeds from the vanilla bean ,
the grated lemon zest , the egg, and finally the rum . Knead everything by hand until you get a smooth and compact dough,
shape it into a loaf, then flatten it a bit with your hands, cover it with cling film , and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour. After this time, roll out the dough with the help of a rolling pin until you obtain a thin sheet (about 1/8 inch), then cut out the cookies with Christmas-shaped cutters .
Transfer the obtained cookies onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper, brush them with the egg white , and sprinkle them with colorful candy sprinkles . Bake the befanini in a static oven, preheated, at 356°F for 7-8 minutes (keep an eye on the baking as the cookies should not darken too much). Once ready, take them out and let them cool on a wire rack . The befanini are ready: Happy Befana!
You can store the cookies, completely cooled, in a tin box for up to one week.
If you are making them for children, you can omit the rum and use rum flavoring, as it does not contain alcohol.
