instructions:
To prepare the glazed chicken wings, first clean the wings from any remaining feathers . Then pass them over a flame to clean them completely . Place them in a bowl as you go .
Then add the paprika , the honey , the tomato pulp ,
the salt , the oil , and the apple cider vinegar .
Then chop the chili pepper , peel the garlic cloves and slightly crush them. Add both to the bowl (11-12).
Mix everything with your hands (13-14), cover with plastic wrap, and place in the fridge for 3-4 hours. Then place the wings on a baking tray lined with parchment paper .
At this point , bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 50/55 minutes. Once they are golden brown, take them out of the oven and serve them hot !
If you have leftover wings, you can store them in a food container in the refrigerator for 24 hours. When you need to serve them, just reheat them for a few minutes in the oven or microwave; being very tender, they will still be delicious the next day.
Accompany the wings with oven-baked, matchstick-cut potatoes.
