instructions:
To make the chocolate salami with coffee, first prepare the coffee with a moka pot: you will need 70 g. Chop the dark chocolate with a knife and melt it in a bain-marie or microwave , then roughly crumble the cookies with your hands .
Put the softened butter in a bowl, add the powdered sugar and mix well with a whisk . At this point, pour in the melted, slightly cooled chocolate ,
the coffee at room temperature , and the unsweetened cocoa powder , and blend everything together with the whisk. Finally, add the crumbled cookies
and incorporate them into the mixture with a spatula . Pour the mixture onto a sheet of parchment paper and shape it with your hands into an elongated form , then roll up the parchment paper to wrap it completely and twist the ends to seal it . Place the roll in the refrigerator and let it firm up for at least 2 hours.
After the chilling time, remove the parchment paper and dust with powdered sugar . Your coffee chocolate salami is ready to be served !
The coffee chocolate salami can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. It can be frozen for about 1 month.
For a caffeine-free version, you can use the same amount of barley coffee or a decaffeinated coffee blend.
