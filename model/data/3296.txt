Schiacciate con melanzane scamorza e pomodori secchi is, honestly, one of Tuscany's best snacks, especially when summer hits hard. Picture this: a classic eggplant flatbread , but with a little twist. Grilled tender eggplant slices are piled on chewy schiacciata bread. Super tasty. The smoky eggplant? It melts slightly in the oven, sitting alongside cubes of scamorza cheese—gooey and stretchy. Add a sun-dried tomato flatbread kick, and you're in for a tangy surprise. In central Italy, especially around Florence, you'll spot these at family gatherings, outdoor parties, or just a chill weekend lunch. It's what brings people together—really really brings them together—one flavorful bite at a time.
The combo of flavors in this eggplant and scamorza flatbread keeps everyone reaching for more. No question. A crispy exterior gives way to moist cheese and rich, salty sun-dried tomatoes. Seriously good. Each bite is simple, yet it works beautifully, especially when the soft grilled eggplant blends with that slightly smoky scamorza. Schiacciata bread has a rustic vibe, kinda like focaccia but thinner, with plenty of golden edges to enjoy.
So here's the thing: this dish is an awesome way to highlight Italian ingredients. Perfect for lighter, flavor-packed options. Whether you're creating a buffet, prepping plates for friends, or just looking for an easy Italian flatbread recipe, this one nails it. Really. The whole experience feels relaxed, fresh, and perfect for sharing—a go-to for anyone who loves homemade flatbread with eggplant or wants a taste straight from Tuscany’s summer tables. It's all about savoring the simple, authentic flavors of Italy while hanging out with good company and delicious food.
To prepare the flatbreads with eggplant, smoked cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes, first wash the eggplant and cut it into fairly thin round slices . Cut the smoked cheese into small cubes and finish by cutting the sun-dried tomatoes into strips .
Now heat a cast-iron grill pan and grill the eggplants on both sides ; meanwhile, place the 12 flatbreads on a baking sheet covered with a sheet of parchment paper. Once ready, lightly salt the eggplants and place a slice on each flatbread (if the slice is too large, cut it in half) . Top each flatbread with 3-4 cubes of smoked cheese and a few strips of sun-dried tomato and bake at 356°F (approximately 180°C) for about 5 minutes, until the smoked cheese has melted. Complete the appetizers by placing a basil leaf on each flatbread with eggplant, smoked cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes!
Consume the flatbreads with eggplant, smoked cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes as soon as they are made. You can store the grilled eggplants in an airtight container in the fridge for a day and assemble your flatbreads at the moment.
If you prefer, you can add the sun-dried tomatoes at the end, after passing the flatbreads in the oven.
