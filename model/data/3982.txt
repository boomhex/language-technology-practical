First, prepare the filling for the vine leaf rolls: clean and chop an onion (1-2) and do the same with the aromatic herbs .
Sauté the finely chopped onion in a pan with extra virgin olive oil until it wilts. Then add the rice, chopped parsley, chopped mint, dill, salt, pepper, half a cup of water and let it cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking . Then prepare the vine leaves ,
wash the vine leaves well and after blanching them in boiling water , let them drain well by laying them on a clean cloth. Then let the mixture cool and when it is cold, place a teaspoon in each leaf, positioning it at the edge .
Fold the leaf over itself first the top edges then the side edges (10-11) to ensure the filling does not escape .
Use about ten leaves to cover the base of a tall, thick-bottomed pot ; place the rolls obtained on these leaves in the pot to form concentric circles and gradually overlapping the rolls. Once all are placed, pour the lemon juice over them and enough cold water to cover the last layer of rolls ; cover everything with a plate and a weight so they do not fall apart during cooking and cook on very low heat for about 1 hour, or until the water is completely absorbed. Let them cool and serve cold.
Did you know that besides making excellent rolls, vine leaves have many medicinal properties? It seems that fresh leaves are very effective in treating skin diseases and that a decoction of vine leaves is excellent for compresses and washes, and also, a decoction of young leaves, harvested from May to August, has a strong astringent property.
Attention, please: if you are using canned vine leaves, preparation begins 12 hours earlier. This is the time you need to soak them in cold water, then drain and dry them carefully before proceeding. Can't find vine leaves? Substitute them! They are not the same, but blanched cabbage or savoy leaves will perform the same function excellently. 
For a "warm" version, add minced meat, fennel seeds, cumin, pine nuts, and marjoram to the filling: once must be tried, but they are certainly less suitable than the original ones to accompany fish dishes, as tradition has it.
