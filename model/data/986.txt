To prepare the chanterelle omelette, first clean the mushrooms under running water . In a pan about 8 inches in diameter (the same pan will also be used to cook the omelette), heat the oil with the garlic clove , then add the chanterelles .
Salt and pepper and cook over medium heat for about 8-10 minutes . At the end of cooking, remove the garlic and let it cool slightly.
Pour the eggs into a bowl and beat them with a whisk , then add the grated Grana Padano PDO and parsley .
Salt , pepper, and mix, then add the mushrooms and stir again to combine everything .
Pour the egg mixture into the same pan where you cooked the mushrooms . Cover with a lid and cook over medium heat for 6-7 minutes, then detach the edges of the omelette with a spatula .
Flip the omelette using the lid or a plate, slide it back into the pan , and cook for another 6-7 minutes. Once ready, transfer the chanterelle omelette to a plate and serve !
The chanterelle omelette can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days or you can freeze it.
If you wish, you can enrich the omelette with diced scamorza, either sweet or smoked!
