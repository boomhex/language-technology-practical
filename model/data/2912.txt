Sfoglie con battuto di lardo al rosmarino is this snack that totally captures the heart of Tuscany and its awesome culinary tradition. And look, the real star here is lardo di Colonnata . This stuff is from the charming village of Colonnata, nestled in the Massa Carrara mountains. It's not just any lardo—seriously good stuff—it's delicately sweet and has this fragrant aroma. Why? It’s all because of how it's cured in marble tubs with rosemary, garlic, and a special spice blend.
In Tuscany, they really love to finely chop this Italian lardo appetizer with fresh rosemary, creating a creamy, herby topping. Then, they spread it on these crispy pastry sheets. So simple, right? But wow, the crunch in each bite is amazing. It might sound all fancy, but this rosemary lardo spread is pretty simple, letting the quality ingredients really shine. It’s a hit at gatherings, perfect when you want something quick and super tasty.
The warmth of the pastry just slightly melts the lardo, mixing it with rosemary to give you that herby, savory, and golden richness. It’s like tasting the Tuscan countryside in each bite. And the sauce? Forget about it—no need for additional toppings. Some say it’s like classic puff pastry with lardo or even lardo and rosemary crostini, but sfoglie offers a lighter, more airy experience.
Whether you're chilling with friends, serving up traditional Italian antipasti, or just exploring new ways to enjoy Colonnata lard , these bites are super, super good. They show that sometimes the best dishes—like Tuscan lardo dishes —let the great ingredients take the spotlight. This recipe is really a delicious reminder of how simplicity and quality create something memorable. It’s a taste of Italy’s beautiful countryside and culinary heritage, for sure.
Really, can't go wrong here. Enjoy every bite!
To prepare the pastries with lard spread, start with the rosemary: finely chop a sprig; then move on to the Colonnata lard; cut the slices into strips and then into even smaller pieces (2-3).
Then gather the lard in a small bowl and add the rosemary , mix the ingredients to obtain a homogeneous mixture , then transfer it to a piping bag with a star nozzle. You can compose your pastries with lard and rosemary spread: place a dollop of the mixture on each pastry and serve them garnished with a few rosemary leaves if you prefer!
You can store the pastries with lard and rosemary spread in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. You can store the lard spread directly in the piping bag or in a container covered with plastic wrap for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can enrich the pastries with lard and rosemary spread with sautéed radicchio added on the crispy pastry before the spread!
