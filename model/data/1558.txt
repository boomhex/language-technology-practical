instructions:
To prepare the rice disc, first cut the caciocavallo into slices and then dice it . In a hot pan, add the bacon and sauté for 3 minutes over high heat without adding any extra fats.
Then add the peas and sauté for another 3 minutes, then turn off the heat and set aside . Brush with butter the inner edge of a pastry ring with a diameter of 20 cm (8 inches)
Next, sprinkle with breadcrumbs and place the ring on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Inside, pour 400 g of leftover yellow risotto , compacting well with the back of a spoon. Stuff with the caciocavallo
and the peas sautéed with bacon . Season with fresh oregano and cover again with the leftover risotto .
Press the surface well with the back of a spoon and cover with Parmesan and breadcrumbs .
Finally, drizzle with a little oil and bake in a preheated convection oven at 428°F (220°C) for the first 5 minutes, then continue for another 3 minutes in grill mode. When cooking is complete, remove the rice disc from the oven, which should be well golden on the surface . Let it cool slightly, then remove the ring and serve your rice disc .
Store the rice disc in the refrigerator for a maximum of a couple of days. Freezing is not recommended.
Stuff your disc with other enticing ingredients like sun-dried tomatoes in oil, speck cubes, and other seasonal vegetables of your choice.
