To make the veal roll with walnuts, take some veal pulp and cut it accordion-style, trying to obtain a single long slice, at least 1 inch thick (or have your butcher perform this cutting operation). Thoroughly pound your piece of meat after removing any fatty edges ; wash the parsley well, remove the stems, and chop it very finely, then chop or break the walnut kernels. On top of the slice of meat, place the cooked ham , the sliced fontina cheese, and the chopped parsley
and the walnut kernels, in this precise sequence . Roll it all up and tie your roast well with string, so that the filling cannot escape during cooking and insert a sprig of rosemary and two or three sage leaves between the strings .
At this point, place the roast in a saucepan, in which you have previously melted the butter with the oil, and brown it so it takes on color on all sides . Season the veal roll with pepper and salt, sprinkle with milk and let it cook on low heat for at least one hour and 30 minutes, remembering to turn the roast from time to time. At the end of cooking, the milk should have reduced and the cooking base should be creamy . Check that the roast is perfectly cooked, then remove it from the pan and keep it warm, covered. Blend the cooking base with an immersion blender and then, if necessary, thicken it further by adjusting the salt and pepper at the end. Once ready, serve the roast sliced, without the string, and covered with the cooking sauce.
Did you know that walnuts are considered the fruit of witches? The legend tells that witches loved to gather at Sabbath meetings under a walnut tree, a symbol of strength and wisdom, to perform their magical rites.
Since the eye also wants its part, why not present the roll laid on a bed of curly lettuce, decorated with some walnut kernels? 
If you prefer sweeter flavors to walnuts, replace them with almond flakes: the deliciousness will remain intact!
