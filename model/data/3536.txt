In a saucepan, put the oil, butter, minced garlic, and shallots; let them soften over low heat for 10-15 minutes, then add the shrimp and cook them for 5 minutes, then add the chickpeas, thyme leaves, salt, and pepper . When everything is well-flavored and the cooking liquid has evaporated, turn off the heat and let it cool slightly. Pour all the ingredients into a blender and blend, then add the egg and cubed sandwich bread ,
then blend again until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture . In the meantime, boil the shrimp and shell them, leaving only the tail end .
Divide the mixture into 15 balls, with which you will flatten and cover the shrimp , forming croquettes that leave the shrimp tail visible. Dip the croquettes in beaten egg and then in breadcrumbs , then fry them in hot oil (maximum 350-390°F) and drain them on a plate lined with kitchen paper. If you prefer, you can choose to bake the chickpea and shrimp croquettes in the oven, setting the oven temperature to 390 degrees and baking the croquettes for about 15 minutes or until they are golden. Serve the chickpea and shrimp croquettes still hot, accompanied, if you like, with some sauces such as mayonnaise, soy sauce, cocktail sauce.
