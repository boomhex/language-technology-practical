Pasta cacio e ova, I gotta say, is a classic from Campania that really shows off how amazing traditional Italian pasta recipes can be. Seriously good stuff with just a few ingredients. It's known as Neapolitan egg and cheese pasta , and, to be honest, it's simple, yet so so creamy and satisfying. The star of the show? Tubetti. It's a short pasta that’s just perfect for holding onto the silky sauce. The magic, you know, happens with a mix of eggs, pecorino, and Parmigiano Reggiano, all beaten together to coat the pasta in a moist and rich way. And the garlic? A hint sautéed in olive oil adds a tender flavor without overpowering anything. Pretty simple. The trick is the timing—keep it creamy, not chunky.
Throughout Campania, this dish is, for real, celebrated as an example of authentic Neapolitan recipes —comfort food that doesn’t feel heavy. Thing is, mixing the egg and cheese off the heat lets the sauce cling to the pasta instead of scrambling, which keeps it all smooth and rich. No question, it's a crowd-pleaser, especially for those who love easy Italian pasta dishes that don’t need much fuss but still feel special. Different families have their twists—more cheese here, different pasta there—but everyone agrees it should be golden and not dry.
What you end up with is a bowl of pasta cacio e ova that’s perfect for sharing. It tastes like home and tradition all at once. So, next time you're craving that true pasta with egg and cheese sauce —the kind that's always comforting and never boring—this is the one that'll make you feel like you’re in the heart of Campania. Whether it's a casual dinner or a special occasion, this dish brings a touch of Italy’s southern charm to your table, letting you savor the authentic taste of Campanian culinary heritage with every bite. Really, really good.
To prepare pasta cacio e ova, cook the tubetti in boiling salted water for the time indicated on the package . Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk and season with salt and pepper .
Add the grated pecorino to the eggs , mix and finally add the grated parmesan . You will obtain a light and thick mixture .
In a non-stick pan, heat the extra virgin olive oil and brown a clove of garlic ; as soon as it is golden, remove the garlic and turn off the heat. The tubetti will be ready: drain them and toss them for a minute in the oil flavored with garlic .
Wait for the tubetti to cool a bit, then add them to the cheese and egg mixture directly in the bowl : stir well with a wooden spoon to ensure the pasta is well amalgamated with the eggs and finally finish with a generous sprinkle of chopped parsley . Your pasta cacio e ova is ready!
Store the pasta cacio e ova in an airtight container until the next day.
The secret to pasta cacio e ova is its creaminess: for this reason, it's important to wait a few seconds before pouring the pasta into the cheese and egg mixture, otherwise, it will set too much. You can also add 3-4 chopped basil leaves together with the parsley at the end.
