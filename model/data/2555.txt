To make the cake pastries, start by preparing the sponge cake base: in a bowl, pour the eggs, sugar , and a pinch of salt. Beat them for about 20 minutes with an electric mixer, then add the oil , water, and continue to work the ingredients with the electric beaters. Split the vanilla pod and extract the seeds to add to the mixture .
In a small bowl, sift the flour, potato starch, and baking powder; incorporate them into the batter one spoonful at a time and continue to mix with the beaters to blend all the ingredients. Transfer the obtained batter into a greased and floured square cake pan measuring 10 inches on each side and bake in a preheated static oven for about 25 minutes at 350°F (or at 320°F for 15 minutes if using a convection oven). Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool down .
Meanwhile, prepare the custard: take the vanilla pod, cut it with a small knife , and extract the seeds by scraping it, place a large saucepan with milk and cream on the stove (you can omit the cream and use 100 ml of fresh milk instead); add the seeds and vanilla pod to the milk and cream . Turn on the stove on low heat, and when the mixture is close to boiling, turn off the heat and let the vanilla infuse for at least 5 minutes. In the meantime, continue with the preparation by separating the egg whites from the yolks; place the yolks in a large bowl and add the sugar .
Beat the yolks and sugar with an electric mixer or a hand whisk to obtain a smooth cream. When they are pale and frothy, add the cornstarch . Remove the vanilla pod from the heated milk and cream and combine it with the egg mixture . In a bowl, soften the gelatin sheets in cold water for at least 10 minutes; then turn the low heat back on and continuously whisk to thicken the mixture. When the cream is thick, turn off the heat and pour in the well-squeezed gelatin, stirring to dissolve completely.
Pour it into a wide and shallow bowl; cover immediately with cling film in contact and let it cool at room temperature, then place it in the fridge. Take the sponge cake and cut it in half , fill one half with the chilled custard ,
close with the other half and let it set in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. Then take the cake and divide it into 25 equal cubes of about 2 inches , keep them in the fridge and start preparing the glaze: sift the powdered sugar and place it in a bowl, add the hot water and mix to obtain a smooth glaze.
Divide the glaze into 4 bowls: color one with red food coloring, adding a little at a time until you get a pink tint , then place 6 pastries on a rack with a plate underneath and pour the glaze over to cover them completely . Color the second bowl of glaze with yellow food coloring and pour it over another 6 pastries. Use yellow and blue coloring to get a pastel green tint, cover another 6 pastries and let them dry.
Finally, color the last bowl of glaze with blue food coloring to get a light blue tint and pour it over the remaining 7 pastries . When the glaze is dry, take the edible glue and apply it to the edge of the pastries , then pour the chopped hazelnuts in a bowl and roll the pastries in it to adhere the nuts to the edge where you applied the edible glue .
As you cover all the pastries with the nuts, place them in a paper cup. Take the edible pencils and the chocolate caramel pencils, draw a pattern on each pastry , then apply the soft pearls, and finally, add a small wafer flower in the center of each pastry . The cake pastries are ready to be enjoyed .
Store the cake pastries in the refrigerator for a couple of days. You can freeze the whole cake without glaze.
Have fun making other variations, for example with a chocolate sponge cake and a delicious ganache filling.
