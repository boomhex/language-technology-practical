instructions:
Fragrant cookies to be enjoyed alone or dipped in fortified wine: however you want to eat them, wine cookies will surprise you for their simplicity and sweetness. They are made only with flour, oil, wine and sugar: they are aromatic due to the presence of anise, and fragrant thanks to the mixture of oil and white wine. One pulls the other at any time of the day... and night! They are also perfect, like tozzetti or cantucci (almond cookies), to serve to guests after dinner with coffee.
To prepare the wine cookies , start by placing the anise seeds in the white wine, stir and set aside. Pour the sifted flour with the baking powder , a pinch of salt, and sugar into a bowl.
Mix by hand and then create a basin, where you can pour the oil and wine with the anise seeds . Knead with your hands.
Move to a work surface once you have collected all the ingredients. Compact the dough well and then take off one piece at a time, about 1 oz (28 g) , work it between the palms of your hands and create a strand of about 8 inches (20 cm) long .
Roll it up by joining the ends, sticking them together well . Now you can dip the cookie in sugar , on one side . You'll should het about 40 cookies.
Arrange the cookies by hand on a sheet lined with baking paper, with the sugar part facing upwards . Cook in a static oven preheated to 350° (180° C) for about 25 minutes. Then take your wine cookies out of the oven , let them cool and serve.
You can store wine cookies in a tin box or airtight container for 7-10 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of white wine, use red wine to give your cookies a nice brownish color!
