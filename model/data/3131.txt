To prepare the mint and chocolate cupcakes, start by sifting together the flour, cocoa, and baking powder in a bowl . In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using the whisks of an electric mixer), beat the butter with the brown sugar . When you have a creamy mixture, add the room temperature eggs one at a time .
When the eggs are incorporated, add the previously sifted flour, one tablespoon at a time , and lastly the Guinness beer , then mix until you get a creamy and homogeneous mixture .
Take a muffin tin lined with cupcake liners and pour the mixture into each liner , leaving 0.4 inches of space from the edge. Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 30 minutes (or in a convection oven at 320°F for 25 minutes). Meanwhile, prepare the buttercream: put the water, sugar, and mint sprig in a small saucepan .
Dissolve the sugar over low heat and bring the mixture to 250°F with the help of a cooking thermometer. When the syrup reaches the temperature, strain it to remove the mint leaves . Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks until you get a frothy mixture, then add the previously strained syrup .
Soften the butter and add it gradually, still beating . Finally, add the mint syrup . When the buttercream is ready, add the coloring (you can also use powdered or liquid colorants, adding them gradually to the mixture until you achieve the desired color). Mix well to combine. Put it in a bowl covered with plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool. Put the cream in a piping bag with a star tip and decorate the cupcakes with a swirl of cream . Chop the chocolate into flakes to garnish the cupcakes and finish the preparation by decorating each cupcake with mint leaves and chocolate flakes . Store the mint and chocolate cupcakes in the fridge until ready to serve.
You can store the cupcakes in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. You can freeze the already baked cupcake and thaw it in the refrigerator as needed.
Saint Patrick's Day is a traditional Irish celebration, of Christian origin, celebrating Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, who lived in the 4th century and whose mission was to Christianize the then-pagan Irish. Initially, the color associated with Saint Patrick was blue, but over the years it has been replaced by the green of the shamrock, used by the saint to explain the doctrine of the Trinity to the Irish pagans. Saint Patrick is celebrated on March 17 not only in Ireland but in all countries with a significant Irish population. The celebrations include evenings filled with dances, folk songs, and toasts with local beer, all colored in green.
These cupcakes are amazing! Perfect for a dinner with friends! They are versatile for countless variations: cocoa base instead of Guinness and cream to your liking. If you feel prompted to replace the cream because the butter one turns out lumpy, no problem: you can easily fix it by adding a knob of melted butter and mixing vigorously.
