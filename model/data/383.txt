instructions:
To prepare the puff pastry fans, first unroll the first puff pastry sheet with its parchment paper and brush with water . Spread 1 ½ tablespoons of sugar over the entire surface ; use your hands to press it down to ensure the sugar adheres perfectly .
Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and flip the puff pastry to the other side. Brush again with water and spread another 1 ½ tablespoons of sugar over the surface .
Starting from the short sides, roll the puff pastry towards the center to form two joined cylinders of equal shape and thickness. Repeat the same steps to sugar and roll the second puff pastry. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Retrieve the puff pastries and cut slices approximately ½ inch thick .
Arrange the puff pastry fans neatly on the baking sheet , spacing them apart from each other, and bake in a convection oven at 350°F for 15 minutes or until the surface is golden . Your puff pastry fans are ready to be served !
Puff pastry fans can be stored in a cool, dry place, such as a tin box, for 2 or 3 days.
If you prefer, you can replace granulated sugar with brown sugar.
Letting the puff pastry rest in the fridge makes the cutting process easier and helps maintain the desired shape.
