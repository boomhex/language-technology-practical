To prepare the eggplant flans, wash the two eggplants and trim them; cut one into slices about 1/4 inch thick widthwise and grill them on a hot cast-iron grill on both sides .
Then cut the other eggplant into slices about 3/8 inch thick and dice them . Then prepare the other ingredients: wash and quarter the cherry tomatoes ;
peel a clove of garlic and chop the thyme sprigs . Then dice the provolone and cut the cooked ham into strips .
Drizzle a large pan with a little oil and brown the garlic clove (you can use it whole and remove it after cooking). Then add the chopped thyme and diced eggplants , stir with a wooden spoon and sauté over low heat for a few minutes. Then add the cherry tomatoes and add water to aid the cooking.
Add salt and pepper to taste and cook for about ten minutes until the eggplants have softened . Once cooked, turn off the heat. Carefully oil the ceramic ramekins using a pastry brush and place a slice of eggplant on the bottom .
Continue with a layer of diced eggplants , then a strip of cooked ham and diced provolone .
Continue creating layers by alternating ingredients and finish each flan with a layer of eggplants and diced provolone . Then place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake them in a static oven at 390°F for 20 minutes (355°F for 10 minutes if using a convection oven). Once ready, remove the eggplant flans from the oven and once cooled slightly, turn them over onto serving plates to serve!
Store the eggplant flans in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 1-2 days. You can freeze the flans if you used all fresh, non-thawed ingredients.
Not a fan of provolone? You can use mozzarella, and if you want, you can make the filling with zucchini instead of diced eggplants!
