instructions:
Whoopie pies, honestly, are as American as apple pie—especially in Maine and Pennsylvania where they first caught on. These classic whoopie pies are rooted in Amish culture. Back then, Amish women would pack them into lunch baskets, and the name "whoopie" comes from the joyful shout when someone found one. Really fun, right? Picture two soft, moist chocolate cakes with a fluffy marshmallow filling made from egg whites, sugar, and a hint of vanilla. This New England dessert has been loved for generations—you’ll find it at bake sales, fairs, and family gatherings across the country.
What makes the whoopie pie recipe so special is the tender cakes made from a rich cocoa base, paired with a sweet creamy center that makes every bite memorable. Seriously good stuff. Think of these as the American version of sandwich cookies, but way more soft and pillowy—almost like a hand-held cake. People love homemade whoopie pies because they’re fun, nostalgic, and take you back to summer picnics.
Some bakers in Maine add a splash of coffee to boost the chocolate, while those in Pennsylvania go for the old-school traditional whoopie pie style. And the filling? It's what really gets people talking—gooey, fluffy, and just the right amount of sticky. Especially made the old Amish way with real marshmallow. Even though there are many creative versions today, nothing beats the basic, easy whoopie pie recipe when you want a snack that’s a little old-fashioned and melt-in-your-mouth good.
These treats make everyone smile and wonder—how can something so simple taste so amazing? Whether for a special occasion or just because, whoopie pies bring a touch of joy and a taste of American tradition to any table. Pretty simple, really. And look, you can't go wrong with that.
To prepare the whoopies, start by adding a teaspoon of lemon juice to the fresh liquid cream (if you have buttermilk, go directly to step 2). Add the vanilla extract to the mixture and stir. Beat the room temperature butter together with the sugar using a mixer (or a stand mixer) until you get a light and fluffy mixture.
While still beating, add the room temperature egg , the salt, and the cream and lemon mixture (or buttermilk) with the vanilla . In a separate bowl, sift the flour and cocoa ,
add the baking powder and mix all the dry ingredients with a whisk . Now gently incorporate them into the butter, sugar, and egg mixture ,
alternating with the room temperature milk . You should get a rather dense mixture which you'll place in a pastry bag with a smooth nozzle about 3/4 inch in diameter. Squeeze mounds of about 1 1/2 inches in diameter onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper (you should get rather tall semi-spheres) for a total of about 16 mounds per tray . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 13-14 minutes, then remove the whoopies from the oven and transfer them to a wire rack using a steel spatula. Let the whoopies cool.
In the meantime, prepare the marshmallow cream by dissolving the granulated sugar in water in a small saucepan; when the syrup comes to a boil, let it cook over medium heat for at least 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff peaks form, and when the 5 minutes have passed, add the hot sugar syrup in a thin stream while continuing to beat. Continue until the mixture is lukewarm. Then incorporate the vanilla and the powdered sugar .
The whoopie cream should be dense, smooth, and glossy (16-17). Transfer it to a pastry bag with a smooth nozzle and squeeze the cream onto the flat side of a cookie and cover with the flat side of another cookie. Continue in this way until all the ingredients are used up.
You can store the whoopies in the refrigerator, in a covered container, for up to a week. Before serving, let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
If you have leftover marshmallow cream, you can form mounds on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake them at 175°F for about 1 and a half to 2 hours like regular meringues.
