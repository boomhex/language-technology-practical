To make the olive puffs with frittata cubes, start with the preparation of the frittata: in a bowl, place the whole eggs, beat them with a whisk , add salt, pepper , and season with chopped parsley
and then finally add the cheeses: grated parmesan and diced scamorza . Moisten and wring out a sheet of parchment paper and line a baking dish measuring 6x8 inches .
Pour the mixture into the pan and bake in a preheated oven at 350°F for about 25-30 minutes. Remove from the oven, let it cool slightly, and turn it out onto a cutting board . Now cut the frittata into strips about half an inch wide
and from these, cut small cubes about 1/2 inch . With the help of kitchen tongs, place the frittata cubes on the puffs . Your olive puffs with frittata cubes are ready to be crunched!
Store the olive puffs in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one day.
You can accompany the frittata on puffs with an eggless herb mayonnaise or you can fill the frittata with the fillings you prefer: for example, with zucchini or potatoes.
