So, you're on a mission to spice up your potato game, huh? Torrette di patate arrosto is your ticket. It's Italian magic, I gotta say. You take regular potato stacks and turn them into something special. Really special. Instead of just tossing slices onto a sheet, you stack 'em into little towers. And, oh boy, they come out crispy on the outside, tender inside. Different regions, different twists, but the goal? Keep it simple and make it look great.
The golden color these roasted potato stacks get—just wow. If you've ever tried patate duchessa, you'll see they have that same wow factor. But, here's the thing, without all the fuss. Just layer those slices, stack 'em up, and boom, you get a blend of moist and crispy in every single bite. Everyone loves these as an easy potato side dish . Why? Each stack is like its own little portion. No fighting over pieces.
Across Italy, these crispy potato stacks are a hit at gatherings. People want something impressive but, you know, pretty simple to make. Some add parmesan for that super super parmesan potato stack taste. Makes them more savory, a bit cheesy. Others use muffin tins—keeps it tidy. That's why they're sometimes called muffin tin potatoes .
However you make 'em, those crispy edges with a soft center are the key. Every bite, so so special. Guests are always surprised by how tasty and cool they look. And look, you can experiment—throw in herbs or spices. For sure, they match anything on the table.
In the end, these baked potato stacks —it's all about turning potatoes into something exciting and elegant. Without stress. Pairs well with almost anything. Next time you're aiming to impress without the hassle, give these a shot! You'll love how they turn out. Seriously good stuff.
To prepare the roasted potato towers, carefully wash and peel the potatoes , then slice them rather thinly (about 1/8 inch) using a mandoline (if you don't have one, you can use a knife). Be sure to keep the potatoes straight while slicing, to get slices that are as round and regular as possible. Finely chop the rosemary with a mixer and start assembling the towers:
place salt , pepper , and a pinch of chopped rosemary on the first potato slice,
overlay a second slice and season again with salt, pepper, and rosemary: continue this way until you form "towers" about 1.5 inches high. Once you have assembled them all, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and drizzle a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil over the surface of each tower . Bake everything at the highest power of your oven for 25-30 minutes, until golden (be careful not to burn the potatoes too much) . The roasted potato towers are ready: serve them hot.
We recommend consuming the potato towers as soon as they are ready, but if you wish, you can store them in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to a couple of days (knowing that they will lose their crispiness).
If you prefer a more "rustic" dish, you can use the potatoes without peeling them.
