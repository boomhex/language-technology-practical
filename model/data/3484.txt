instructions:
To prepare the spicy beef, start by washing a bell pepper, cut it in half, remove the stem and seeds and slice it into fairly thin strips . Also cut the meat into strips about 0.4 inches wide and 2 inches long. Then chop the two chili peppers that you have halved to remove the internal seeds. Heat the oil and chili in a wok and add the pepper strips , salt and pepper and cook for about 10-15 minutes.
In the meantime, you can bring a pot of water to a boil and then pour in the basmati rice . After the pepper cooking time has elapsed, add the beef strips , sauté them until they are cooked, seasoning with 6 tablespoons of soy sauce .
Carefully mix, being cautious not to break the peppers . Once the beef is cooked, remove the wok from the heat, add the chopped chives and bean sprouts , mix everything and drain the basmati rice. Serve the spicy beef with the rice and optionally add more soy sauce to taste. To enrich the spicy beef with basmati rice, you can add a tablespoon of toasted sesame seeds to release their aroma.
We recommend storing the spicy beef with peppers and bean sprouts in the refrigerator, closed in an airtight container, for up to one day.
Not to lie: beef is, as they say, its ideal match, but you can prepare this recipe with your preferred meats, from chicken to pork. Remember, however, to slice them finely, as they need to cook very quickly! If you want to add even more color to the dish, you could add other vegetables, such as mini corn, oriental and original enough to impress your guests!
