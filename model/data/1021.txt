So here's the thing, Parisian gnocchi is creamy, and it's a twist—really a big twist—on the classic idea of gnocchi. And I gotta say, it's got a story that's just as rich as its flavor. We're talking pâte à choux gnocchi here. This comes right out of French pastry tradition, but don't let the name fool you. Honestly, folks in Florence? They’ve been doing this for ages, thanks to some inspiration that probably floated over the Alps centuries ago.
A quick look at the dish, and you’ll see that golden oven-baked top bubbling with cheese and béchamel. And look, that's what really really sets this Parisian gnocchi apart from the usual Italian table fare. The tender inside, made with that airy choux dough, just soaks up all the sauce. I mean, it is a bite that's both moist and rich, you know? Each forkful kind of gives you a taste of the old days in Tuscany. Back when chefs started borrowing a few fancy French ideas and made them their own.
Fans of the French gnocchi recipe can't stop talking about that special béchamel sauce—the way it’s loaded with sharp cheese and just the right saltiness. Which is great. What's fun about this dish is it feels both simple and a little bit fancy. You get this cool mix: crispy edges from the gratin, a soft middle, and that unmistakable whiff of baked cheese filling the kitchen.
Italian cooks? They love serving these as a first course, especially when they want something that looks as good as it tastes. In Tuscany, it’s seen as a bit of a celebration dish—perfect for times when you want to impress but still keep things down to earth. And here's the thing, there are a few local twists, too. Some folks mix in a bit of nutmeg or use different cheeses, but the base stays true to that choux pastry gnocchi idea. All together, it’s a classic example of how Italian kitchens turn old influences into dishes that are comforting and kind of special, making gnocchi à la Parisienne a hit at any gathering.

To prepare your Parisian-style gnocchi, start with the dough. You will need to make choux pastry, so place the milk and butter in a saucepan and heat over medium heat. When it begins to simmer, add the flour .
Stir with a spoon until the mixture is smooth and well detached from the sides . Turn off the heat and add the Parmesan , continuing to stir until fully absorbed .
Now transfer the dough to a stand mixer with a paddle attachment and set it to medium speed. Add one egg at a time , making sure to wait until the previous one is completely absorbed before continuing. Once the eggs are mixed in, add the nutmeg .
Salt and give it a final stir . With the help of a spatula, place the dough in a piping bag with a plain 16 mm nozzle . Let the dough cool in the refrigerator.
In the meantime, prepare the sauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the flour . Stir with a whisk on low heat for a few minutes. Gradually add the milk , continuing to stir with the whisk to avoid lumps. Once all the milk is added, increase the heat to medium and stir until it thickens (like béchamel).
When the mixture has thickened, turn off the heat and add the grated cheeses , salt, and pepper . Mix well to melt the cheeses.
By now, the dough will have cooled. Bring a pot of water to a boil and salt it. Position yourself with the piping bag above the pot and squeeze with one hand; when about 1 1/4 inches of dough comes out, cut it with a knife letting it fall into the water . This way, you will form your gnocchi. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then drain them onto a tray with the help of a slotted spoon . You will get about 21 oz of cooked gnocchi.
Take small pans or small baking dishes (if round, 7 inches in diameter, if rectangular, 8x5.5 inches) and spread 2 tablespoons of sauce on the bottom . Place the gnocchi on top and cover with another 2 tablespoons of sauce .
Sprinkle with grated Parmesan . Add small knobs of butter on top and put to gratinate in a preheated oven, for 10 minutes on the top shelf in grill mode at 464°F. Once out of the oven, the Parisian-style gnocchi will be ready to be served .
Parisian-style gnocchi can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. You can prepare the baking dishes in advance and store them in the fridge to gratinate just before serving.
You can replace the Gruyere with another soft cheese like a local Toma cheese.
