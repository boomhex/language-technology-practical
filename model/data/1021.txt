instructions:
To prepare the yogurt and apricot mousse, start with the meringue. Pour the water into a heavy-bottomed saucepan, add the sugar and cook over low heat, stirring to dissolve it. Insert the food thermometer to indicate the temperature to reach, which is 250°F. When the temperature of the syrup reaches 237°F, place the egg whites in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or use an electric mixer).
Whip them to soft peaks at medium speed . When the syrup reaches 250°F, lower the speed of the mixer (to prevent the syrup from splattering on the sides of the bowl), pour half of the syrup into the egg whites and then increase the speed again. Wait a few seconds and continue to slowly pour the syrup, without pouring it directly onto the whisk. Continue to whip until the meringue has cooled completely . Set the meringue aside.
In a bowl, pour the fresh whipping cream, Greek yogurt , and vanilla seeds . Start whipping with the beaters .
You should obtain a semi-whipped mixture . Now incorporate the meringue into the cream and yogurt mixture a little at a time until you obtain the mousse .
Transfer the mousse to a piping bag without a nozzle and squeeze about 3.35 oz of mousse into 6 dessert glasses with a capacity of 4.22 oz . Transfer to the fridge for at least 2 hours. Meanwhile, prepare the apricots: wash and dry them, remove the pit, and cut them into wedges .
In a pot, pour the apricots, sugar , and the seeds of a vanilla bean . Mix everything together and let it cook over low heat for about 20 minutes or until they are cooked .
Transfer to a bowl and let cool . Once the mousse has set, retrieve the cups and garnish with the apricot coulis . Return to the fridge for 30 minutes, then top with a fresh mint leaf and serve your yogurt and apricot mousse .
The yogurt and apricot mousse can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days. Freezing is not recommended.
To make the apricot compote, you can also use granulated sugar, but the flavor will be less aromatic.
