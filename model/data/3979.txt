To make crepes suzette, start with the basic batter: put the sifted flour , granulated sugar, seeds from half a vanilla pod, a pinch of salt, and milk in a high-sided bowl. Work the mixture with a hand whisk or an electric mixer until smooth . In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with a fork, then add them to the other ingredients and continue to mix.
Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat and let it cool slightly, then add it to the crepe batter and mix thoroughly. Finally, add the grated zest of half an orange to the batter . Mix the ingredients well to obtain a dense, lump-free batter . Cover the batter with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least half an hour. After the resting time, take the crepe batter, get a crepe pan, flat with low sides, heat the pan, pour a ladle of batter , and cook the first crepe by rotating the pan to distribute the mixture over the entire surface.
Cook the crepes on both sides, turning them with a spatula . As you cook the crepes, transfer them onto a plate one on top of the other to prevent them from drying out . Fold the crepes into quarters to create small fans .
Now prepare the sauce, grate the zest of 3 oranges , squeeze their juice and strain it , grate the lemon zest, squeeze the lemon juice
Squeeze the juice and strain it through a sieve . Place the butter in a pan with the sugar and melt them over low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon , use a steel pan, ideal for flambéing.

In France, where crêpes are an institution, there are specific tools for cooking them. It would be nice, once, to try the super traditional version of crêpe suzette by cooking it on the “galéatoire”, a thick circular cast iron plate, and flipping it with the “tournette”, the spatula specifically created for turning crêpes. Isn’t there anyone passing by there who could help me find these wonders?
Did you know that in France crepes are considered a traditional symbol of friendship and alliance? Indeed... it even seems that tenant farmers offered them to their landlords as a sign of friendship and gratitude. Traditionally served on Candlemas and Shrove Tuesday, it was customary to make a wish when flipping the crepe in the pan.
