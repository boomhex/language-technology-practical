Transfer the potatoes to a bowl, season with peeled garlic cloves , desalted capers , and black olives .
Add the onion and the tomato pulp. Season with salt, pepper, olive oil , and oregano .
Mix with a spoon and pour the potatoes into a baking dish . Bake in a preheated fan oven at 375°F for about 40 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes to ensure even cooking. Once cooking time is over, remove the Mediterranean potatoes from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving !
