To prepare the yogurt panna cotta with peach jelly, start by making the panna cotta. Soak the gelatin in cold water for about 5-10 minutes and in the meantime pour the lactose-free cream into a saucepan . Add the honey ,
the sugar , mix with a whisk and bring to a simmer. At this point, turn off the heat, squeeze the gelatin sheets well and add them to the hot cream, stirring quickly with the whisk until completely dissolved.
Transfer the mixture to a bowl and let it cool, then add the lactose-free yogurt and mix quickly with a spatula . Take a silicone mold or a muffin tray, place the glasses inside it, tilting them slightly, and fill them with your yogurt panna cotta . Cover with plastic wrap and let cool in the refrigerator for at least 3-4 hours.
After this time, prepare the peach jelly. Soak the gelatin in cold water for about 5-10 minutes and in the meantime pour about 1/4 cup of peach juice into a saucepan . Bring it to a simmer and add the previously squeezed gelatin .
Mix quickly with a whisk until the gelatin dissolves and add the remaining juice . Mix again and let it cool in a pitcher. Then take your glasses from the fridge, pour the lukewarm peach jelly over the now solidified panna cotta and place back in the refrigerator to solidify for at least 2 hours. When serving, focus on decorating the glasses. Wash and dry a nectarine and cut it in half .
Slice it and use the slices to garnish each glass, adding mint leaves and half a sprig of red currant . Now you just have to enjoy your yogurt panna cotta with peach jelly.
Before pouring the jelly over the panna cotta, it needs to cool well, otherwise, it will risk melting. To prevent this, you can place the glasses in the freezer for 10 minutes before completing them with the jelly.
Store your yogurt panna cotta glasses with peach jelly for no more than 2-3 days, always covered with plastic wrap.
