instructions:
To prepare flamenca eggs, first peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes about 1/4 inch . Heat enough oil to cover the bottom of a pan, add the potatoes , and fry them over high heat until golden .
Meanwhile, clean and chop the onion , then stew it with a drizzle of oil in another pan along with the garlic clove .
In the meantime, slice and dice the chorizo . When the onion has softened, add the chorizo and sauté for another 5 minutes, then add the peas .
Add the tomato sauce , salt , pepper, and cook covered over medium heat for about 30 minutes. After this time, add the potatoes .
Mix well and turn off the heat. At this point, distribute the sauce among 4 cocottes and add the jamon serrano, tearing it with your hands .
Finally, gently pour in the egg, which you have cracked into a separate bowl, being careful not to break it . Bake the cocottes in a static mode at 392°F for 10 minutes . Once cooked, serve your flamenca eggs with a pinch of salt !
It is recommended to consume the flamenca eggs immediately. If necessary, you can store them after cooking in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container.
If you can't find chorizo, you can replace it with salami, spicy or not!
