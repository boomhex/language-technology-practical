Triangolini with artichokes and quartirolo is like the rockstar of appetizers at any gathering. Seriously good. In Lombardy, these little triangles offer a fresh twist on the classic Italian stuffed pasta . Instead of your typical pasta dough, this dish goes for ultra-thin phyllo—super crispy. It bakes into a light shell that just crunches when you take a bite.
Inside? A delicious mix of chopped artichokes and rich quartirolo cheese . I mean, this cheese is something else—it's a crumbly, tangy cheese that's really popular in northern Italy. It brings a creamy touch to the tender artichoke, making every bite taste really, really bright and full of flavor. And listen, this isn't just another pasta appetizer; the texture is unique, and the flavors blend in a way that feels special but not too fancy. Plus, the sweet and sour sauce on the side? So so perfect. It's just the right dip, offering a tangy and sweet contrast that makes you want another triangle right away.
What's cool about the triangolini with artichokes and quartirolo is how quick it is to prepare—perfect for anyone who loves easy snacks that still impress a crowd. And you know, you'll often find these on tables in Lombardy when people are after something fun and a bit different from the usual traditional Italian pasta or heavier starters. The use of phyllo dough comes from more Mediterranean traditions, giving these triangles a lighter, flakier texture than you'd get from pasta—making them ideal for spring and summer gatherings.
The filling in this artichoke triangolini recipe focuses on the moist, herby artichoke and the salty, almost creamy quartirolo cheese melting together. Guests usually go for seconds because, and here's the thing, the combo is just right: golden pastry, flavorful insides, and a zippy sauce that ties everything together. For sure. For anyone looking to mix things up with their quartirolo cheese pasta lineup, these triangles are a fun, simple, and super snackable option. They bring a modern vibe to any spread while keeping the best parts of traditional flavors from Lombardy.
To make the artichoke and quartirolo triangles, start by preparing the filling: sauté 2 crushed garlic cloves in a non-stick pan with a drizzle of oil, then raise the heat and add the artichokes . Cover with a lid and cook over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes . In the meantime, cut the quartirolo into cubes of about 0.4 inches .
When the artichokes are golden , lower the heat and cook for a few more minutes, then salt and pepper . Roughly chop the artichokes and transfer them to a bowl.
Add the chopped parsley and the quartirolo cubes . Mix well and adjust with salt and pepper, if necessary.
Set the filling aside and prepare the sweet and sour sauce: pour the vinegar and water into a saucepan , add the sugar , and reduce over medium heat until it reaches a honey-like consistency .
You are ready to make the triangles: take one of the 8 phyllo pastry sheets, place it on the work surface, and brush it entirely with olive oil . Place another on top and align them perfectly, pressing to make them adhere well .
Brush the second sheet with oil as well , then flip the two sheets together to brush the base too. You have completed the first piece made of two phyllo sheets: proceed in pairs like this for the others, to obtain 4 pieces in total. Using a pastry cutter, divide each of these double sheets into 3 strips of 2x12 inches, lengthwise : in total, you will have 12 rectangles.
Add a scant tablespoon of filling to one corner of the first rectangle and fold to form a triangle , then continue folding in this way until you reach the opposite end of the strip .
Arrange the obtained triangles gradually on a baking tray lined with parchment paper . Bake in a preheated fan oven at 356°F for 15 minutes. When they are nicely golden, remove from the oven and serve the artichoke and quartirolo triangles accompanied by the sweet and sour sauce !
It is advisable to consume the artichoke and quartirolo triangles immediately, otherwise, they will lose their crispness.
You can accompany the artichoke and quartirolo triangles with mayonnaise or yogurt sauce, as an alternative to the sweet and sour sauce.
Instead of parsley, you can use fresh mint!
