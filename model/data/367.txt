instructions:
To prepare the pistachio semifreddo, first focus on the custard. In a saucepan pour the milk and cream and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, in a bowl crack the eggs, add the sugar and the cornstarch .
Mix until you get a homogeneous mixture, then add the vanilla extract , milk, and cream .
Mix again and transfer the mixture into the saucepan. Thicken the custard over low heat, stirring constantly . Pour the custard into a bowl and add the pistachio spread , stir until you obtain a homogeneous mixture . Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.
Now focus on preparing the Italian meringue. In a saucepan pour the sugar and water and bring to a temperature of 250°F . Meanwhile, whip the egg whites in a stand mixer with the beaters .
Gradually add the syrup at 250°F and continue to whip. Once the meringue is ready, add the pistachio custard and mix with upward movements . Separately, semi-whip the 1 1/4 cups of fresh cream .
Add it to the meringue and mix with upward movements to avoid deflating the mixture. Add the pistachio granules , mix one last time, and set aside.
Now prepare the base. In a mixer place the cookies , add the pistachio cream and blend until you get a homogeneous and sandy mixture .
Pour the meringue mixture into a rectangular 10x3.5 inches pan, greased and lined with baking paper . Cover the surface with crumbled biscuits and let it rest in the fridge for 6 hours.
Unmold and remove the baking paper . Sprinkle the surface with pistachio granules . Your pistachio semifreddo is ready to be served .
The semifreddo should be stored in the freezer. It is important to cover it well, with plastic wrap or in a closed container, to prevent it from absorbing unwanted odors. In this way, it can be stored for up to a month without losing its texture and flavor.
You can customize the semifreddo by adding a base of different cookies, such as classic dry biscuits or whole grain cookies.
