This recipe draws inspiration from the flavors of Roman cuisine, adding a fresh and colorful touch, perfect for spring. The dough for the gnocchi is made with cow's milk ricotta and Parmesan cheese, unlike the classic potato gnocchi , to achieve a soft and enveloping texture. The sauce is a burst of flavor: crispy guanciale, fragrant green onion, and fresh peas sautéed in a pan. To complete it all, a generous mix with pecorino romano which makes the dish creamy and irresistible. Try these ricotta gnocchi with peas, pecorino, and guanciale and let yourself be won over by their goodness!

To prepare the ricotta gnocchi with peas, pecorino, and guanciale, place the ricotta, grated cheese , and eggs in a bowl. Stir with a spoon to combine and achieve a smooth cream, then incorporate the flour .
Once the flour is absorbed , transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and work it as little as possible : just enough to get a soft but not sticky dough that you will shape into a sausage. Take portions of the dough .
Form rolls about 3/4 inch thick . Using a dough scraper or knife, cut them into pieces about 1/2 inch long . To prevent them from sticking together, lightly dust them with semolina or flour. Press in the center with your thumb to form a cavity .
As you form the gnocchi, place them, well spaced, on a tray lined with a floured tea towel . Prepare the sauce: cut the guanciale into 1/2 inch cubes and place it in a preheated pan . Sauté for about 5 minutes or until crispy and golden .
Add the finely chopped green onion and let it stew for a couple of minutes, then add the peas and sauté for another 2 minutes. Deglaze with the white wine and let it evaporate completely.
Cook the gnocchi in plenty of boiling salted water , and as soon as they float, drain them directly into the pan with the sauce adding a ladle of the gnocchi's cooking water .
Mix off the heat with the grated Pecorino , adding more cooking water as needed to achieve the right creaminess . Scent with fresh mint leaves .
Finish with grated lemon zest and pepper to taste. Mix and serve immediately your ricotta gnocchi with peas, pecorino, and guanciale !
It is recommended to eat the ricotta gnocchi with peas, pecorino, and guanciale immediately after preparation.
You can freeze the raw gnocchi: place them well spaced on a tray, then firm them up in the freezer, and once hardened, you can transfer them to freezer bags. This way, they will not stick together, and you can cook them directly from frozen.
To obtain firmer and easier-to-work ricotta gnocchi, we recommend draining the ricotta well before using it. You can let it rest in a colander lined with a clean tea towel for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator: this way, it will lose excess water and allow you to use less flour, avoiding a too-hard dough. The result will be softer and lighter gnocchi that hold their shape better during cooking.
For optimal results, you can do a test cooking by forming a single gnocco while working the dough, so you can adjust the measurements if necessary.
