So here's the thing, this cherry tomato tart is like a genius move straight out of an Italian kitchen. With just some flaky pasta sfoglia—yeah, that's puff pastry—and a bunch of fresh juicy cherry tomatoes, you're set. It’s pretty simple, yet it turns out tender and delicious. The pastry turns all golden in the oven, and the tomatoes? They get sweet and juicy—making each bite special—really special.
This dish is a perfect example of how Italians whip up something quick when the fridge is looking kinda empty. Perfect for a chilled dinner or even a laid-back lunch. It's often called a cherry tomato galette , or maybe a cherry tomato pie , depending on how rustic you're feeling. The key is the mix of buttery pastry and those ripe tomatoes. Seriously good.
And look, in some regions, they throw in extras like black olives, maybe some thin slices of red onion, or even a bit of burrata to boost the flavor. Serving this savory tart cold or at room temperature? Totally typical. Especially when it's warm out and you want something fresh and light. This cherry tomato tart recipe pops up everywhere, from picnics to family tables. Works as an appetizer or just a snack.
The beauty here is how versatile it is. You know, sprinkle some herbs or switch out the tomatoes if you want, but the basics—puff pastry and tomatoes—stay the same. Gives you something crispy outside and moist inside, showing that classic Italian knack for making magic with what you have. Whether you call it a cherry tomato galette recipe or just a quick tart, it keeps people coming back. For sure.
Enjoy this great treat with friends or family and savor the real taste of Italy in every bite. Really, you cannot go wrong.
To prepare cherry tomatoes in crust, first wash them under running water . Transfer them to a bowl and season with salt , pepper, and oregano .
Mix and set aside. Move on to the puff pastry: roll out the pastry and cut it in half lengthwise . From each half, cut 8 strips lengthwise . Your strips should be 1.18 inches wide and 5.12 inches long.
Take the first strip and gently stretch it with your hands. Now you need to wrap it around the tomato, so make a first turn, holding the edge of the pastry in place with your thumb . Continue wrapping around, also covering the base . The puff pastry should be tight. Gradually place the tomatoes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper .
At this point, sprinkle them with dried oregano . Bake on the lowest rack of the oven, set to static mode, and preheated to 392°F for 15 minutes, then switch to fan mode and continue baking for another 10 minutes. Remove the cherry tomatoes from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving .
It is recommended to consume the cherry tomatoes in crust immediately.
Add white and black sesame seeds.
