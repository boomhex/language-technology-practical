instructions:
To prepare the cocoa four quarters cake, first weigh the shelled eggs and pour them into a bowl. Add the sugar and whip with electric beaters until the mixture increases in volume, becoming light and frothy. At this point, add the softened butter in pieces and blend with the beaters to combine it. Also, add the vanilla extract and mix again.
In a separate bowl, pour the flour, cocoa , and baking powder , then sift the dry ingredients into the egg mixture .
Incorporate the dry ingredients with the beaters until you obtain a creamy and homogeneous mixture, with a rather firm consistency . Now butter and flour an 8-inch cake pan and pour the mixture inside.
Level the surface with a spatula and bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for about 35 minutes. Before removing from the oven, do the toothpick test and let it cool down before removing the cake. Once cooled, unmold the cocoa four quarters cake onto a serving plate and dust the surface with powdered sugar . The cocoa four quarters cake is ready to enjoy!
The cocoa four quarters cake can be stored for 2-3 days at room temperature, under a glass dome.
You can freeze it after baking.
It's very important to weigh the eggs and accordingly adjust the amounts of flour, butter, and sugar: we used 4 small eggs, but if you use larger eggs, you'll need fewer. If you wish, you can flavor the batter with orange zest as an alternative to vanilla.
