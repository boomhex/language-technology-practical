instructions:
To prepare the apple and gorgonzola risotto, first make the acidic butter. Finely chop the shallot . In a small saucepan, melt the butter and add the shallot .
As soon as the shallot begins to fry, pour in the white wine and cook for 5 minutes over medium heat. Once ready, transfer it to a bowl and let it solidify in the refrigerator while you continue with the recipe. Meanwhile, prepare the puree: cut 2 apples into wedges , remove the seeds and the central part.
Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and season with oil , salt, and pepper . Bake in a fan oven, preheated to 392°F (200°C) for 15 minutes. Separately, cut an apple into slices 1/12 inch (2 mm) thick .
In a pan, melt some butter, add the apple slices and season with salt and pepper. Sauté over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add the honey .
Deglaze with red wine vinegar . Add the thyme and turn off the heat. Set aside; they will be used for plating .
Take the apples cooked in the oven and transfer them to a jug . Blend with an immersion blender, adding a little water if necessary , about 0.7 oz (20 g), until you obtain a smooth puree .
Pour the rice into a pot , add the oil , and toast for a few minutes. Pour in the vegetable broth and cook, adding a ladle of broth each time the previous one is absorbed by the rice.
One minute before the end of the cooking time, add the apple puree , the acidic butter , and the Parmesan cheese . Turn off the heat and stir.
Let the risotto rest for 1 minute, then plate it and add some gorgonzola flakes . Place the sautéed apples on the surface of the rice and finish with a sprinkle of thyme. Your apple and gorgonzola risotto is ready to be served .
It's best to consume the apple and gorgonzola risotto right after it's made, but if there are leftovers, you can store it in the refrigerator in a closed container for up to 2 days.
If gorgonzola is too strong for your taste, you can replace it with a milder cheese like robiola or taleggio. You can add a crunchy touch with chopped walnuts, toasted almond slices, or pistachios.
