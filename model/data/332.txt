To prepare the spinach pasta swirls, start with the fresh pasta: pour the flour and eggs into a bowl , then mix with a fork to combine . Transfer the mixture to the work surface and continue kneading with your hands .
Once you have a smooth and homogeneous dough , wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: in a saucepan, sauté the oil with a clove of garlic, then pour in the tomato purée and a little water, just enough to rinse the jar. Season with salt and basil leaves and cook over low heat for about 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, take care of the spinach: in another saucepan, sauté the oil with a clove of garlic, then add the cleaned spinach . Salt, cover with the lid , and cook over medium heat for about ten minutes, just enough to wilt them slightly .
Drain the cooked spinach in a colander and press them to remove excess liquid , then let them cool. Once well drained, chop the spinach with a knife and transfer to a bowl, then add the ricotta and mix well.
Flavor with nutmeg and pepper , then combine everything .
After the resting time, lightly dust the work surface and the dough ball with semolina, then roll it out to form a rectangle about 20x12 inches, with a thickness of a couple of millimeters .
Trim the edges of the rectangle , then add the spinach mixture and spread it evenly with a spatula, leaving a 0.5-inch border on the long sides .
Gently roll the sheet starting from the long side , then slice the roll into pieces about 1.25 inches wide; with these amounts, you'll obtain 15-16 swirls . Meanwhile, the sauce will be ready, so remove the garlic clove .
Now you can assemble everything: take a baking dish about 11 inches in diameter and spread plenty of tomato sauce on the bottom , then place the slices with the cut side up and press them gently to spread them .
Cover the swirls with the remaining sauce and sprinkle the surface with the grated cheese . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 30 minutes, then turn on the grill mode for another 3 minutes. Once gratinated, your spinach pasta swirls are ready to be served !
The spinach pasta swirls can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container.
You can freeze them either raw or cooked.
If you wish, you can flavor the spinach filling with lemon zest for a touch of freshness.
If you don't have time to prepare the dough, you can use ready-made pasta sheets, but you'll need to adjust the size. If blanching is necessary, be sure to slightly reduce the baking time.
