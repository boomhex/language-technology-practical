instructions:
If you're looking for a fun and creative twist on Northern and Central Italian cuisine, mushroom nests with pumpkin cream and mozzarella are the way to go. Really good stuff. This dish steps away from traditional baked pasta by using crespelle —Italian-style crepes—as the base. They're rolled up with a smooth, velvety pumpkin cream and bits of earthy dried porcini mushrooms. And the sauce? It’s super creamy. What really makes these spirals special is how they're baked until golden and topped with a mini ball of mozzarella, creating a gooey, melting cheese effect that's hard to resist. So so good. The flavors blend beautifully, with the sweet and nutty pumpkin balancing the deeper, woodsy mushrooms. Compared to regular pasta al forno, this pumpkin cream version feels lighter but still really satisfying, especially with those cheesy tops bubbling in the oven.
In Northern and Central Italy, ingredients like porcini mushrooms and pumpkin are staples in local recipes during fall. This mozzarella recipe combines these classic ingredients in a way that feels both familiar and fresh. The nests have a tender bite from the crespelle, and every forkful offers a mix of moist pumpkin, cheesy stretch, and a hint of mushroom flavor that just works. Really really works. It's easy to see why this baked mushroom dish is perfect for a dinner with friends or as a special vegetarian appetizer . The presentation is impressive—those little spirals with melted cheese on top look fancy without being fussy. Pretty simple. You don’t need to use complicated techniques. Just a few good ingredients and some time in the oven give you cheesy mushroom bites that are different from the usual, tasting like they came straight out of an Italian home kitchen. And look, everyone gets their own nest, so it feels special. Plus, the mix of crispy edges and soft insides is what makes this a keeper for any collection of fall recipes . With every bite, you are getting a taste of Italy's heart and creativity, making it a dish that's not just delicious but memorable too.

To make the mushroom nests, pumpkin cream, and mozzarella, first soak the dried mushrooms in cold water . Meanwhile, prepare the crepe batter: melt the butter in a saucepan and let it cool. In a bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk, then pour in the milk and mix again.
Add the melted butter to the mixture and a pinch of salt. Combine everything and also add the sifted flour . Mix until you get a smooth and homogeneous mixture . Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
Move on to the pumpkin cream: clean the pumpkin and cut the flesh into irregular cubes . In a pot, heat the oil with the rosemary and a clove of garlic in its skin , then add the pumpkin cubes .
Salt , pepper, and pour the water , then cover with a lid and cook on low heat for about 30 minutes, stirring often .
While the pumpkin cooks, drain the mushrooms, filter the soaking water, and set it aside. In a pan, flavor a splash of oil with a clove of garlic in its skin , then add the mushrooms and about 1 1/4 cups of their water .
Cook over medium heat for about 20 minutes , then remove the garlic and season with chopped parsley . Set the mushrooms aside.
At this point, the pumpkin will be cooked, so turn off the heat and remove the garlic and rosemary , then add the milk and mix well until you get a cream .
Now you can cook the crepes: place a crepe pan (or a non-stick pan) with a diameter of 11 inches on the stove and grease it with a little butter, then pour a ladle of the batter into the center and swirl the pan to distribute it evenly (or use the appropriate spatula). After about a minute on medium-low heat, the edges will start to detach , then flip the crepe and cook it for another minute on the other side, it should be slightly golden . Continue this way until all the batter is used up, stacking the crepes on a plate as you go.
You are ready to assemble the dish: spread each crepe with the pumpkin cream , add some mushrooms , and roll it up .
Trim the edges of the roll and divide it into pieces about 1 1/2 inches wide ; with these quantities, you will get about 20 pieces. Place the spirals obtained in a baking dish previously greased with oil, placing them upright next to each other . Finally, add a small mozzarella on top of each nest .
Drizzle the surface with a little oil and sprinkle with grated Grana Padano PDO . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 10 minutes, then switch to grill mode at 464°F for another 4-5 minutes. Your mushroom nests, pumpkin cream, and mozzarella are ready to be served !
The mushroom nests, pumpkin cream, and mozzarella can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
Dried mushrooms can be replaced with fresh ones.
If you wish, you can enrich the filling of the mushroom nests, pumpkin cream, and mozzarella with slices of cooked ham!
