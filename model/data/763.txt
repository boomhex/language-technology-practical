instructions:
To prepare the pizza swirls, start with the dough. Sift the flour into a large bowl, add the sugar and the yeast .
Mix to combine the ingredients . Gradually pour in the water , kneading directly in the bowl .
As soon as you've incorporated all the water and obtained a homogeneous dough, add the salt and knead with your hands until absorbed . Now transfer the dough to a work surface and add the oil .
Continue kneading until the dough becomes smooth and homogeneous . Transfer it to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap .
Let it rest in a place protected from drafts until it doubles in size . With these amounts of yeast, it will take about two hours. When the dough has doubled, transfer the peeled tomatoes to a bowl, season with salt, oil, and oregano; then mash them with a fork . Then transfer the dough to a floured surface .
Dust it with a little flour and roll it out with a rolling pin . You should obtain a rectangle 10.5 inches wide, 15.75 inches long, and 0.16 inches thick. Now spread the tomato almost all over the surface of the rectangle, leaving a 0.4-inch border .
Place the slices of provolone and the pitted sliced olives on top. Gently roll up from the longer side .
Make sure to keep the seam of the roll facing down . Now, using a knife, cut 11 swirls about 1 inch wide . Gently transfer them onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper and lightly dusted with flour .
Let them rise for another 30 minutes . At this point, bake in a preheated convection oven at 392°F, on the middle shelf for 15 minutes. When they are nicely golden, remove from the oven and serve your swirls .
The pizza swirls can be stored for 2 days in a food bag. Alternatively, they can be frozen after baking, once cooled.
Choose the filling you love most: ricotta and spinach, olive pâté and provolone, or pesto and smoked cheese.
