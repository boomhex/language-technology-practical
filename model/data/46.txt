instructions:
To prepare the veal roast with Marsala, first peel and chop the garlic along with the sage leaves and rosemary needles . Take the already tied roast, salt it , pepper it, and coat it with the aromatic mixture .
Massage the meat well with your hands to flavor it on all sides . In a saucepan, heat the butter along with a drizzle of oil .
When the butter is melted, place the meat in the pan and brown it well on all sides ; it will take 5-10 minutes. Once the meat is well browned, transfer it to a baking dish and collect the cooking juices in a bowl . Removing the fat part will give you a lighter sauce.
Deglaze the pan with the Marsala and white wine . Let it cook for a few minutes until the alcoholic part has evaporated .
Pour the cooking juices over the meat , cover with aluminum foil , and bake for an hour and a half in a preheated static oven at 356°F, or until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 158°F-167°F. At this point, remove the roast from the oven .
Transfer the meat to a platter and let it rest for 5 minutes, covering it with a sheet of aluminum foil. Strain the cooking juices directly into a saucepan. In a separate bowl, pour the cornstarch and water .
Stir well to dissolve the starch , add it to the cooking juices , and cook for a few more minutes until it reaches a boil .
You should get a thicker sauce, but still quite liquid . If you plan to serve the roast immediately, remove the string from the meat and slice it , then serve with the sauce.
If you want to serve it the next day, transfer the roast slices back to the pan and sprinkle them with the reheated sauce to make it liquid again . Cover with a sheet of aluminum foil and heat everything in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 15-20 minutes. After this time, all that's left is to serve your veal roast with Marsala, perhaps accompanied by some Roasted potatoes !
The cooked veal roast with Marsala can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. The best way to keep it tender is to separate the meat from its sauce, let it cool completely, and then place it in an airtight container. You can also freeze it for 1-2 months this way.
Once you've massaged the meat with salt, pepper, and herbs, if you have time, you can leave it in the fridge for up to 12 hours. Choose dry Marsala, not sweet, and always combine it with white wine. One will give the aromatic part, the other the acidity. Otherwise, if you don't want to use alcohol, you can use beef broth and orange juice.
