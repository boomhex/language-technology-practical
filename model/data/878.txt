Fagottini with broccoli and ricotta? It's a Southern Italy classic, and let me tell you, it’s really something special. I mean, all the goodness of Italian stuffed pasta without the fuss of complicated shapes. Instead, they use puff pastry (or pasta sfoglia) to wrap up this creamy, savory mix. And what’s in it? Tender broccoli, fluffy potato, and smooth ricotta —really, it’s a dreamy combo. Oh, and here's the thing, they sneak in some sautéed sausage with aromatic rosemary and a dash of nutmeg. Super tasty. So, so good. These aren’t just your everyday antipasti. Nope, they stand out. People in places like Puglia and Campania just love turning local ingredients into something magical. And listen, the smell of fresh rosemary and sausage? Fills your kitchen—seriously good.
For party spreads or weekend get-togethers, these little parcels are a hit. Really. You won’t believe how easy they are to make. The ricotta and broccoli pasta filling is a crowd-pleaser. Trust me, you get that golden, crispy crust from the puff pastry, and the filling stays nice and tender. Unlike other complicated homemade pasta with ricotta recipes, fagottini can be prepped ahead. Perfect for busy days, right? Or any festive table. Plus, it showcases how Southern Italians use seasonal ingredients—like broccoli in winter—and mix them with cheeses like ricotta. Whether you’re searching for a new antipasto or want to bring traditional Italian cooking into your weeknight routine, these easy Italian recipes are the way to go. Everyone at the table will reach for them. The combo of creamy, rich filling and flaky crust? Tough to beat, honestly. And look, you can switch up the herbs or sausage depending on what’s around. That’s the spirit of real Italian kitchen creativity—making something special out of everyday stuff. Pretty simple. Can’t go wrong.

To prepare the broccoli and ricotta parcels, start by cleaning the broccoli. Cut them into small florets , which will weigh about 150 grams in total. Now move on to the potatoes: peel them and cut them into 1-2 cm (about 0.5-0.75 inch) cubes . Immerse broccoli and potatoes in lightly salted boiling water and cook for about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, take the sausage, remove the casing, and cut it into pieces . When the broccoli and potatoes are soft, drain them well in a bowl and mash them with a fork .
You should obtain a homogeneous puree . At this point, pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, a sprig of rosemary, and a clove of garlic . Add the sausage and let it brown until it is well golden. Then remove the aromas .
Add the broccoli and potato puree and cook for a few more moments . Turn off the heat, transfer to a bowl, and let cool. As soon as the mixture is lukewarm, add the ricotta .
Season with nutmeg , salt, and pepper. Mix well until you obtain a homogeneous mixture . Unroll the puff pastry roll and, placing the long side towards you, cut out 4 rectangles of the same width .
Fill them halfway, placing the filling in the center and leaving 1 cm (about 0.5 inch) from the edges and then fold the pastry to cover the filling . Pinch first with your fingers and then with a fork, to seal the edges well .
Score the surface, creating 3 V-shaped cuts and transfer onto a baking tray with parchment paper. Brush the surface with the egg yolk and bake in a static oven, preheated to 392°F (200°C), for about 20/25 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve your parcels still hot !
We recommend consuming the parcels within a few hours. Alternatively, you can store them in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
In both cases, we recommend lightly reheating them before serving!
Instead of sausage, you can use bacon or anchovies in oil!
