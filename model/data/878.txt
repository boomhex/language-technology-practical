instructions:
To prepare the cuddura cull'ova, place the flour in a large bowl, add the sugar , the sifted yeast , and the grated lemon zest .
Add the lard and the slightly beaten eggs . Start mixing in the bowl with your hands .
Work the dough very well to mix the ingredients well. Then transfer it to a work surface and knead it further until you get a smooth dough . The dough's consistency won't be hard; in fact, it will be quite soft but not sticky. Take 90 g of dough , keeping the rest covered to prevent it from drying out.
Divide it into 3 parts . Take the first portion and, using a little flour, form a stick .
Do the same with the other two. They should be about 3/8 inch (1 cm) thick and all the same length . Join the three ends together and form a braid .
Gently press to close the end of the braid. Lift it gently and transfer it to a baking sheet, closing it into a circle and gently pinching one end over the other . Wash the eggs for decoration well, dry them, and place one in the center of the cuddura, pressing gently .
Take a small portion of dough and form a stick . Divide it in half and place it over the egg to form a cross . Then gently press the dough to make it adhere well
Continue this way until you finish the dough; you will get 10 cuddura . As you go, place them on the baking sheet, spacing three of them. Brush with the egg and decorate with colored sprinkles . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F (200°C) for about 20-25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool before serving!
They can be stored for about 5 days under a glass dome, at room temperature.

If you want to glaze your cuddura, bake it without brushing with the beaten egg, and prepare a glaze this way: beat an egg white until stiff, then add 10-12 tablespoons of granulated sugar, one tablespoon at a time and slowly, continuing to beat with the mixer. Then gradually add one or two tablespoons of lemon juice, still beating; the mixture should be very dense and fall heavily from the spoon. As soon as you remove the cuddura from the oven, on the same baking tray where you baked it, cover it with the prepared glaze and sprinkle it with colored sprinkles, let it cool, and then enjoy!
