Start the preparation of the olive bread by making the pre-fermented dough. Place the crumbled yeast, lukewarm water , flour, and salt in a small bowl: knead for a few seconds and then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise for about 1.5 hours at room temperature.
The pre-fermented dough should double in volume . Meanwhile, crumble the brewer's yeast in a small bowl and dissolve it with a little lukewarm water (taken from the recipe's dose) along with the malt (or honey) ; put the flour in the mixer bowl fitted with a paddle attachment, start it at speed 1, and add the yeast mixture
the remaining water, in which you have dissolved the salt and oil . Knead for about 10 minutes, add the pre-fermented dough, and when the mixture becomes homogeneous, remove the paddle, replace it with the dough hook, and continue kneading (another 10 minutes) until the dough wraps around it (you may need to add a little flour on the sides of the bowl). During the process, at least a couple of times, stop the machine and use a spatula to clean the sides of the bowl and flip the dough. One minute before finishing kneading, add the roughly chopped olives (8-9) and pat them with absorbent paper.
Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface , work it for a few seconds to give it a spherical shape , then flatten it slightly, roll it up on itself to give it a long shape (like a loaf), and then let it rise in the turned-off oven with the light on, on a baking tray lined with parchment paper until it doubles in volume. Before baking the olive bread in the preheated oven at 356°F for at least 40 minutes, make diamond-shaped cuts (not too deep) on the surface with a smooth, very thin, and sharp knife . When the surface of the olive bread is nicely golden, take it out of the oven and let it cool on a rack.
Store the olive bread at room temperature, closed in a plastic or paper bag, for about 4-5 days. This bread can be frozen once cooked; when ready to serve, let it thaw in the refrigerator and warm it up in the oven for a couple of minutes.
