To prepare friselle with tomato and anchovies, first moisten the friselle with cold water , and place them on a plate . Wash the cherry tomatoes under running water and cut them into small pieces .
Pour the freshly cut cherry tomatoes into a bowl and season them with oil , salt, oregano , and black pepper. Cut the Marinated Anchovies into small pieces ,
and add them to the tomato salad . Also add half the garlic clove, after crushing it , and the basil leaves, torn with your hands .
Mix well to combine all the ingredients and set aside. Lightly salt your friselle and rub them with the remaining garlic part .
At this point, place the tomato and anchovy salad on the friselle, using a spoon . Remove the seeds from the chili pepper, cut it into strips , and place it on the friselle with cherry tomatoes and anchovies .
It is advisable to consume friselle with tomato and anchovies as soon as they are ready. The tomato salad alone can be stored for up to 1 day in the refrigerator and used to season the friselle when needed.
If the idea intrigues you, enrich your friselle with tomato and anchovies with pieces of mozzarella or black olives! Alternatively to marinated anchovies, you can also use those in oil!
In the past, friselle, due to their long shelf life, replaced bread during times of famine; fishermen would take them to sea and, to soften them, dunk them in sea water.
