instructions:
To prepare the Greek yogurt, start by placing a sieve in a bowl and line it with a sterile cheesecloth (or alternatively, a very clean kitchen towel) . Pour in the plain yogurt and cover with plastic wrap .
Store everything in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (you can leave it for 6-8 hours if you prefer a thicker and creamier consistency). After the time has passed, lift the cheesecloth , and you will notice that some whey has dripped from the yogurt into the bowl . Then put the obtained Greek yogurt (about 12 oz) into a bowl . Your homemade Greek yogurt is ready!
Greek yogurt can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days: it is important to keep it in a sealable glass container! Remember, the longer you let the yogurt drain, the creamier and denser it will be: naturally, the weight will also be less.
Greek yogurt can be enjoyed plain to savor its good taste! But if you prefer, you can flavor it with grated citrus zest, grated ginger, seeds from a vanilla bean, or a stick of cinnamon added to the draining yogurt. If you wish to make fruit-flavored Greek yogurt, simply follow the same procedure using whole fruit yogurt to start with. You could also opt for an original variant: flavor your yogurt with chopped chives, mint, or basil for "gourmet" versions.
Not much is known about yogurt, but it seems that even in ancient Greece, it was a commonly enjoyed product. Over the years, it has become a staple in our diet and is even recommended for cases of mild lactose intolerance. People often mistakenly distinguish between traditional yogurt and Greek yogurt: in reality, it's quite the opposite. Our traditional yogurt does not adhere to the traditional method of whey straining.
