instructions:
The picanha in the oven is a succulent and flavorful main course, perfect for a special dinner or a family gathering. This cut of beef, typical of Brazilian tradition and known in Italy as codone or punta di sottofesa, is characterized by a triangular shape and a generous layer of fat on the surface that, during cooking, gives flavor and tenderness to the meat. The picanha is first seared in a pan to get a golden, flavorful crust, then slowly cooked in the oven to enhance its natural tenderness and release its intense and enveloping flavor.
The meat is accompanied by a side of roasted vegetables: zucchini, eggplant, and bell peppers, which add freshness and color to the dish. It is all enriched with a chimichurri sauce, an Argentine condiment made with parsley, garlic, red wine vinegar, and chili pepper, that provides a perfect contrast to the flavorful meat. The picanha in the oven is a dish that will conquer everyone, with its rich flavor and inviting presentation.
Enrich your menu with other typical Brazilian dishes:

To prepare the picanha, salt the meat on both sides . In a skillet, heat a swirl of olive oil and sear the picanha over medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes on each side , to get a golden crust.
Cut the garlic head horizontally , place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper along with rosemary, thyme, and sage. If you prefer, you can heat the herbs with a blowtorch to intensify the flavor . Place the picanha on a rack positioned above the herbs so that the fat can drip onto the sheet below .
Char the meat with the blowtorch for a smoky effect . Cook in a preheated fan oven at 356°F for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the side dish: trim the zucchini and cut them in half lengthwise , then slice into half-moons .
Trim the eggplants and cut them into slices about 0.4 inches thick , then slice into sticks of the same thickness , and finally cut into cubes .
Clean the bell peppers and cut them into sticks of 0.4 inches . Now gather the vegetables on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and season them with oil, salt, and pepper . Also, put the vegetables in the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the chimichurri sauce: in a container, pour the parsley and chili pepper .
Add the garlic , red wine vinegar , and olive oil .
Salt , pepper , and finally add dried oregano .
Blend with an immersion blender to obtain a smooth sauce . When the picanha is ready, take it out of the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing it ; this will help keep the juices inside the meat.
Meanwhile, the vegetables will also be ready , slice the meat , and serve your picanha in the oven with the vegetables and chimichurri sauce .
We recommend enjoying the picanha in the oven while hot.
The vegetables can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days.
You can store the chimichurri in an airtight jar in the refrigerator for about 3-4 days, adding more oil if necessary to ensure it is completely covered. If you don't have a blowtorch, you can omit that step.
If you wish to vary the picanha in the oven recipe, you can experiment with different side dishes, like roasted potatoes or a fresh mixed salad. For the chimichurri sauce, try adding some roasted garlic for a more intense flavor or replace the red wine vinegar with balsamic vinegar for a sweeter note. If you prefer a spicier touch, add some smoked paprika to the meat before cooking!
