To make the savory basil cookies, first place the washed and dried basil leaves in a tall glass, add an egg and blend everything with the immersion blender to obtain a cream that you will set aside. In a bowl, pour the flour and grated cheese .
Add the cold butter cut into cubes . Crumble the mixture with your fingers , then pour in the previously prepared basil cream .
Knead by hand, gathering all the ingredients, then transfer the dough to a work surface and compact it well. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. After the resting time, take the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured work surface .
When you have obtained a sheet about 1/4 inch thick , cut out the cookies with a cutter approximately 2 inches in diameter : we used a cutter with fluted edges . By re-kneading the scraps, you will get a total of about 35-36 cookies.
Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 25 minutes. Once baking is complete, remove the savory basil cookies , let them cool, and then serve them !
Savory basil cookies can be stored for 4-5 days in a tin box. You can freeze the raw dough or the baked cookies.
If you wish to add a fresh note, try flavoring the dough with lemon zest!
