instructions:
To prepare the zebra cake, place the butter into chunks, sugar , and the vanilla bean seeds in a bowl. Beat with an electric mixer to combine.
Now add the eggs and continue beating with the mixer until you obtain a smooth mixture . Sift the flour , potato starch, and baking powder into the mixture using a sieve.
Continue mixing with the mixer , and once the dry ingredients are absorbed, pour in the milk and mix one last time with the mixer .
Divide the batter into two bowls of equal weight , add the cocoa to one of the bowls , and mix again with the mixer to incorporate it.
You will thus have a light and a dark batter . Grease a 9-inch diameter pan, pour a ladle of light batter in the center , and then a ladle of dark batter .
Continue pouring the alternating batters in the center, allowing them to spread naturally across the pan, until all the batter is used . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 55-60 minutes. Once baked, remove the zebra cake from the oven , let it cool, then remove it from the pan .
Store the zebra cake at room temperature, preferably under a glass dome, for up to 2-3 days. You can freeze it after baking.
The two mixtures should have the same consistency and density; if not, thin out the thicker one with one or two tablespoons of milk (usually the cocoa one) to achieve the same consistency as the other batter.
