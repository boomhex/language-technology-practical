Turn on the oven and preheat it to 400°F. Take the Luganega sausage, roll it into two spirals, then secure them by skewering with two skewers in a 'cross' shape . Once skewered, cut off the protruding parts of the skewers (2-3).
Clean the vegetables and cut them into pieces of the same size so they cook evenly, proceeding as follows: Wash the eggplants and zucchini, remove the green top and cut them into not too small cubes. Remove the stem from the peppers, then open them and remove the seeds and inner filaments: cut them into squares. Peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes, then wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them into quarters. Sprinkle the baking sheet with the olive oil , then lay the chopped vegetables on it , salt, pepper, add a bit more oil , and add enough hot water to cover the baking sheet without drowning the vegetables.
Place the sausage spirals on the oven rack . Bake the vegetables on the lower part of the oven , while baking at 400°F for about 45 minutes, checking from time to time to ensure there is always water among the vegetables, so they don't burn during baking. Only in the last minutes of baking will we allow the vegetables to dry up, always being careful not to let them burn. After 45 minutes, take the dishes out of the oven, then serve the sausage with the vegetables .
