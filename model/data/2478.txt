To prepare the baked rice croquettes, start by making the broth to cook the rice. Wash, peel, and chop the celery, carrot, and onion , place the water in a large pot, add the vegetables and the black pepper . Bring everything to a boil and then add the salt. Cover with a lid and cook for about an hour and a half. Once cooked, adjust the salt and strain the broth with a sieve. After this time, peel the shallot and chop it finely, pour the oil into a large saucepan and heat it, then add the chopped shallot .
Sauté it for 10 minutes on low heat, adding a ladle of hot broth . At this point, add the rice and toast it briefly while stirring. Then, deglaze with 100 ml of wine and continue cooking.
Add broth gradually as the rice absorbs the liquids (it will take about 20 minutes). When cooked, turn off the heat . Transfer the risotto to a large baking dish and spread it evenly with a spatula ; cover the dish with plastic wrap and let it cool .
Meanwhile, cut the ham into cubes . Steam the peas for 2 minutes and also cut the smoked provolone into small cubes .
When the rice is cold, divide it into 26 portions of 50 grams each ; Take one, flatten it slightly with your hands into an oval shape and fill the center with ham , peas, and finally the smoked provolone .
Then close the croquettes with the rice, giving them the typical elongated croquette shape . Bread the croquettes by first dipping them in beaten egg and then in breadcrumbs. Repeat the same operation by dipping the already breaded croquette in the egg again and then in the breadcrumbs .
At this point, place the croquettes on a baking sheet and drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 30-35 minutes until the croquettes are golden brown . Serve the baked rice croquettes hot to preserve their crispness .
It's recommended to consume the croquettes immediately; alternatively, you can freeze them raw.
To make the croquettes, keep a bowl of room temperature water nearby to rinse your hands after shaping each croquette. You can vary the filling of your baked rice croquettes to taste, perhaps using excellent ragù or simply sautéed greens with a clove of garlic.
