instructions:
To prepare the flower chocolate cupcakes, start by sifting the flour, unsweetened cocoa , and baking powder into a bowl. In another small bowl, add the softened room temperature butter cut into pieces, and add the sugar .
Work the butter and sugar with an electric mixer (or a hand whisk) , and when you have obtained a soft and creamy mixture, also add the egg . Work the mixture further to combine the egg, then add the salt and continue to mix.
Gradually add the dry ingredients , mixing until completely absorbed ; also add the room temperature milk in a thin stream .
Finally, add the extra dark chocolate chips , mix with a spatula, and fill a piping bag without a nozzle with the mixture . At this point, butter 6 disposable aluminum molds with softened butter (or you can use a muffin mold with paper liners) .
Fill the molds 3/4 full (so that during baking, they'll reach the edge) , place the molds on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , then bake in a static preheated oven at 350°F (180°C) for 35 minutes (or in a fan oven at 320°F (160°C) for about 25 minutes). Once baked, remove them from the oven, let them cool slightly, then remove from the molds and let them cool completely on a rack .
To decorate the flower chocolate cupcakes, you will need to temper the chocolate: melt the 70% dark chocolate in a double boiler (the water in the pot should not touch the bottom of the bowl in which you placed the chocolate) ; when the chocolate reaches a temperature of 129°F (54°C) (measure with a kitchen thermometer), dry the bottom of the pot and pour 2/3 of it onto the marble slab placed on a work surface and begin spreading the chocolate on the marble slab with a spatula and scraper, spreading it over the surface . When it reaches 82°F (28°C) (always measure with a kitchen thermometer) , transfer it to the bowl where you left the remaining 1/3 of the chocolate and mix: the chocolate should reach 88-90°F (31-32°C). If during these phases the temperature drops too low, always keep the double boiler with hot water on hand to slightly warm the chocolate. Conversely, if it's still too hot, repeat the spatulation process on the marble with a small portion of the chocolate.
For the chocolate decorations: place an acetate sheet on the marble surface, then pour a small amount of dark chocolate over it and spread with a spatula (4-5) and create uniform lines with a baker's comb .
Fold the sheet onto itself (7-8) so that the edges touch and remain sealed; place it in the refrigerator to set. For tempering the white chocolate, you can follow the same procedure: melt it in a double boiler and work 2/3 on the marble surface, but the temperature in this case should be 81°F (27°C). The white chocolate will be used to fill the chocolate petals. Dip the now cooled cupcakes in the tempered chocolate left in the bowl and let them set on the rack.
Melt the dark and white chocolate (in the microwave, stirring occasionally until fully melted, or in a double boiler, making sure the water doesn't touch the bottom of the bowl where you placed the chocolate). Take a printed sheet with the decorations you want to make; we chose butterflies; place an acetate sheet on it and, with the piping bag with melted white chocolate to which you've made a small hole, trace the outlines of the design and fill the figure with dark chocolate . Once finished, place the butterflies (wings and body) in the refrigerator to solidify . Remember to keep the chocolate left on a pot with hot water to maintain the tempering temperature (81°F for white chocolate and 88-90°F for dark chocolate, checking with a kitchen thermometer).
When they have solidified, you can assemble the butterflies: squeeze a bit of melted white chocolate at the point where the butterfly's wings should be placed and gently attach one wing , then repeat the same operation for the other; to secure, place it for a few seconds between two pastry rings with the wings slightly elevated (you can also use glasses). Once the chocolate petals have solidified, carefully detach them from the acetate sheet and place them on a tray lined with parchment paper. Then decorate them with white chocolate and place them in the refrigerator. Squeeze a bit of melted white chocolate also on the edge of the crème brûlée chocolate and place the butterfly as if it were landing on a flower .
When they have adhered well, squeeze a bit of melted white chocolate also on the edge of the crème brûlée chocolate and place the butterfly as if it were landing on a flower . Keep in the refrigerator; meanwhile, when the chocolate petals have solidified, gently detach them from the acetate sheet and place them on a tray lined with parchment paper. Then decorate them with white chocolate and place them in the refrigerator.
When all the decorations are well solidified, proceed to decorate the cupcakes: assemble 6 petals to form a corolla on the surface of each cupcake, with a red currant berry in the center ; then add the crème brûlée chocolate and the butterfly next to it and further decorate the flower chocolate cupcakes with the red currant berries !
Store the decorated cupcakes in the refrigerator along with the other decorations for 1-2 days.
Without decoration, the cupcakes can be stored under a glass dome for 2-3 days.
They can be frozen if you used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
