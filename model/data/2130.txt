instructions:
To prepare baked trout, first, gut the fish if necessary, then remove the fins and slice the flesh parallel to the work surface to obtain fillets . For more information on cleaning fish, you can consult our cooking school on How to Clean Salmon Trout . Once you have obtained 4 fillets, remove the bones with kitchen tweezers .
Rinse the cherry tomatoes and leave them whole , then rinse the capers to remove excess salt. Grease a baking dish with oil and place the trout fillets inside, salt and pepper to taste, then add the whole garlic cloves, whole cherry tomatoes ,
pitted olives , desalted capers , room temperature water ,
oil , and thyme sprigs . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 15 minutes, turning on the grill for the last 3-4 minutes. Your baked trout is ready to be served !
You can store the baked trout in the refrigerator for one day in an airtight container. If necessary, it can be frozen for up to 3 months.
If you wish to accompany your baked trout with some slices of bread, you can add tomato sauce to the baking dish to create a delicious Mediterranean dipping sauce, perfect for mopping up! Alternatively, adding potato wedges will be a tasty variation. To make this dish even more aromatic, just grate some lemon zest to taste.
