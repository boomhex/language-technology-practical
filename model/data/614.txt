instructions:
For the sourdough colomba, start with the first dough by pouring into the mixer the first block of ingredients: 40 g of cold water , 75 g of sugar , and 85 g of sourdough in pieces (refreshed as advised).
Also add 50 g of egg yolks and 170 g of flour . Mix at medium speed with the hook for about 15-20 minutes (the dough should not exceed 79°F). After the working time, the dough should be elastic and resistant when stretched with your hands (make sure to grease your hands with butter before touching the dough).
Now it's time for the second block of ingredients: add 50 g of egg yolk fresh from the fridge , let it absorb well by mixing at the lowest speed. Add 20 g of cold water and work until completely absorbed. Then add in three times 100 g of cold butter, reduced to small cubes . Adding it little by little will make absorption easier and prevent the dough from overheating, which should not exceed 79°F.
Once the butter is absorbed , transfer the dough onto a table lightly greased with butter and give it some reinforcement folds by taking the dough from the base, lifting it, and laying it back on the surface with decisive movements . Then close the dough, rotating it with the closure facing down on the work surface: you can help yourself with a dough scraper. Place the dough in a high greased container .
Add some small butter pieces on the surface to keep it hydrated . Cover with plastic wrap and let it mature at around 82°F-86°F (ideally in the turned-off oven with the light on) for about 20 hours. After 20 hours, when the dough has tripled in volume, transfer it to the fridge for another 12 hours .
After 12 hours in the fridge, pour the matured and cold first dough into the mixer bowl . Add 65 g of flour and mix everything again with the hook for about 45 minutes (at the lowest possible speed), until you obtain a well-bonded dough. When the dough is well-bonded, add 30 g of cold egg yolk and let it absorb.
Add 20 g of sugar , 15 g of honey , let it absorb, and then add the seeds of a vanilla bean, 5 g of salt, and 40 g of cold butter cut into small cubes .

Work the dough until all ingredients are completely absorbed . Finally, add 50 g of orange paste, also cold . Add 150 g of orange candied fruit, also well cold , and restart the mixing machine for a maximum of 1 minute.
At this point, the dough will be smooth and well-bonded , transfer it to a work surface well greased with butter, give some reinforcement folds , and then let the obtained dough rest for 30 minutes in a greased container, greasing the surface with butter .
Transfer the rested dough to the work surface , gently seal the dough giving it an elongated shape, like a loaf that is higher in the middle and thinner on the sides . Transfer the dough into a 1 kg colomba mold .
With your hands, widen the central part creating the wings of the colomba , it doesn't matter if it doesn't perfectly fill the space, this will happen during leavening. Close the colomba in a leavening bag and let it mature at 82°F for 12 hours or until the dough has almost reached the mold's edge.
In the meantime, make the glaze: pour into the mixer equipped with a paddle the almond flour, sugar , salt , corn starch, and egg white .
Flavor with the seeds of a vanilla bean and mix all the ingredients at medium speed for about 3 minutes, stopping the mixer during the process to collect the ingredients deposited on the bowl's edge. Transfer the glaze into a piping bag and let it rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes.
When the dough has matured correctly, distribute the glaze on the surface , then gently even it out with a spatula and decorate with almonds .
Distribute also sugar pearls and powdered sugar . Bake the colomba in a static oven for 1 hour at 302°F (after 60 minutes, if the colomba is still pale, increase to 320°F for about 5 minutes). With a digital thermometer, you can check before removing from the oven that the core temperature of the colomba should be 201-204°F.
Once baking is complete, remove the colomba from the oven, pierce it with the special skewers in the center , and let it cool at room temperature for at least 8 hours upside down . The sourdough colomba is ready to be served .
Pack in nylon bags and store at room temperature away from humid places, consume your colomba preferably within 3-4 days.
After the 45 minutes of working in the mixer, the dough will have overheated, so it is important that the ingredients added afterward are very cold.
Place a glass of hot water in the turned-off oven to ensure the right humidity and never open the oven during leavening.
If the glaze is viscous, add almond flour; conversely, if it is too hard, add more egg white.
The sourdough must be refreshed 3 times at intervals of 3 hours between each refreshment.
It is not recommended to make separate loaves to join in the mold as they could compromise the growth and the colomba could split during baking.
