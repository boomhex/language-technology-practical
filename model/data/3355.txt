Caponata su sfoglie alle olive is a classic Sicilian appetizer that really brings a taste of southern Italy to any table. I mean, this dish comes from the heart of Sicily, where folks have been crafting caponata with all kinds of tender fried vegetables for ages. And here's the thing, what truly makes caponata stand out is that special agrodolce sauce—it’s got this sweet-and-sour kick that just wakes up your taste buds. Really does. The mix of eggplant, tomatoes, celery, and sometimes capers gets cooked until everything is moist and packed with flavor. Then, it all gets scooped onto olive pastry squares, which are a bit crispy and super aromatic. These olive bites? Not just for show—they add a crunch and a salty, rich edge that works perfectly with the tangy caponata. Honestly, so so good.
In Sicily, people treat this as a vegetarian appetizer that’s awesome for sharing at parties or even before a big meal. Families have their own takes on caponata, but the combo of fried veggies and agrodolce never changes. Those puff pastry bites topped with olives really make it feel more special, kinda turning traditional Italian finger food into something fancy yet super casual to eat. And look, it’s pretty common to see caponata at Sicilian get-togethers. People love how those golden, flaky bites with the colorful, sweet veggie topping make the plate look just as good as it tastes.
Even if you’ve only had eggplant caponata on its own, this version with the olive pastry totally takes it up a notch. Seriously does. It brings in that extra layer of flavor and crunch. And truthfully, it’s the kind of food that shows how Mediterranean cuisine does simple, fresh, and bold all at once. Perfect for anyone wanting something that feels both traditional and kinda new. This dish is sure to impress with its colorful flavors and inviting presentation, making it a must-try for any gathering.
Wash and cut the eggplants into small cubes and place them in a colander, sprinkling with coarse salt. Let them rest like this for about an hour, so they lose their moisture . In the meantime, cut the celery stalks into thin strips and blanch them in salted water, then drain, dry, and sauté them in oil over low heat . Slice the onion and cut the tomatoes into cubes .
In a pan, sauté the onion in oil, and when it is wilted, add the capers, pine nuts, and olives, browning everything for 10 minutes . At this point, add the tomatoes and cook over high heat for 20 minutes. Drain and rinse the eggplants, taking care to dry them with paper towels. Now, in a non-stick pan, add oil and fry your eggplant cubes until golden. Add the celery stalks, the tomato mixture, and mix everything together . Now sprinkle with sugar and vinegar, cooking again over moderate heat until the vinegar has completely evaporated. Once cooking is complete, place your caponata on the classic olive sheets “La Bottega di Olivia & Marino,” sprinkling everything with flakes of salted ricotta.
