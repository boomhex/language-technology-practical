instructions:
To prepare the mushroom lasagna, start with the béchamel. In a saucepan, heat the milk , in another saucepan, melt the butter over low heat, and then add the flour all at once . Quickly whisk to obtain a roux, a compact mixture .
After about 1 minute, pour the milk in a thin stream while whisking . Continue to cook and stir until the béchamel becomes creamy. Then turn off the heat, season with salt and nutmeg , stir and let it cool, covering with plastic wrap in contact .
At this point, move on to the How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms . Porcini and button mushrooms should be cleaned the same way. Scrape the dirt off the stem , then wipe the surface with a cloth . If they are very dirty, you can briefly rinse them under running water and pat them dry very carefully. Slice the porcini mushrooms ,
then the button mushrooms . Scrape off the dirt, then also slice the chanterelles and the oyster mushrooms .
In a pan with a drizzle of oil, add the porcini and button mushrooms , the oyster mushrooms, and the chanterelles . After a moment, deglaze with white wine .
When the alcohol has evaporated, season with salt, pepper, fresh thyme, and cook for a few more minutes . Meanwhile, prepare the taleggio sauce. Clean the leek and cut it into rings , also cut the taleggio and move to the stove .
Place the cream in a saucepan and add the leek . Season with salt, pepper, and cook everything for about ten minutes over low heat. Once the leek is softened, turn off the heat and add the chopped taleggio . Stir well until it's completely melted .
Now that you have everything, you can assemble your lasagna. Spread a generous spoonful of béchamel on the bottom of a 8x12 inch baking dish . Place the lasagna sheets, thus creating the first layer and continue by adding the taleggio fondue with leeks, more béchamel, and the pancetta .
Then add the mushrooms and the béchamel . Repeat from the beginning, starting again with the sheets ,
the layer of leek and taleggio fondue, the béchamel, the pancetta, and the mushrooms and continue like this until you finish the ingredients. On the last layer, the surface, also add fresh thyme and proceed to baking: the mushroom lasagna cooks in a preheated oven at 350°F for about 40 minutes + a few minutes under the broiler to brown the surface .
Mushroom lasagna can be stored for 3-4 days in the refrigerator, cover them before storing in the fridge.
Add some saffron to your taleggio and leek fondue for a truly aromatic and tasty touch!
