Bocconcini di quinoa are these moist little bites that blend the best of South American tradition with a twist of global flair. And quinoa? It's got a pretty cool backstory. It comes straight from the ancient Inca fields in the Andean highlands. Super interesting, right? People there have been growing it for, like, thousands of years. It's not your regular grain, but a pseudo-cereal, and what's awesome is all the good stuff packed in: essential amino acids, tender texture, and yeah, it's totally gluten-free. So, these quinoa bites are perfect not just for folks wanting healthy quinoa snacks , but also for those watching out for gluten. And you know what happens when you mix in zucchini, Grana Padano cheese, a bit of ginger, and some lemon zest? You get this really tasty combo that’s a little zesty, a little savory, and just all-around fresh.
On a hot day, these quinoa appetizers hit the spot—seriously, they do. Especially when you crave something light yet satisfying. People are usually surprised at how the Andean quinoa pairs with those familiar cheese flavors, making every bite a little adventure. No fuss needed. These are the kind of baked quinoa bites you can throw together for a party or a quick snack. And guess what? They'll be gone before you know it. They’re crispy on the outside, a bit soft inside, and that hint of lemon? It just lifts everything up. Even if someone isn’t usually into quinoa, the mix of textures and flavors in these healthy quinoa snacks makes them really, really easy to love.
So when you need ideas for easy quinoa recipes or want to try something new for summer, these bites are always a hit. Plus, you get to share a cool story about the Incas and how South American tastes come together in one bite. Whether you're hosting friends or just chilling at home, these bites are the perfect go-to snack. Seriously good, no question.
To prepare the quinoa bites, start by placing the quinoa in a bowl and rinsing it under cold water until the water runs clear. This way, you will remove traces of saponins (the thin layer of external resin) present on its grains, which give it a bitter taste . Then, boil the quinoa in a non-stick pan with salted water for the time indicated on the package (about 15-20 minutes) , until the grains have absorbed most of the cooking water, softening and swelling .
Proceed by draining the quinoa and running it under cold water to stop the cooking . At this point, carefully wash the zucchini and trim them . Then peel and trim the fresh ginger as well .
Grate the zucchini and place them in a large bowl , where you will add the grated lemon zest and the grated fresh ginger .
Add the boiled quinoa to the grated zucchini, ginger, and lemon zest , also add the grated Grana Padano and the egg . Adjust with salt and pepper to taste and mix the ingredients until you obtain a homogeneous mixture.
Proceed by placing the mini paper baking cups (with a diameter of about 1.5-2 inches and about 1.2 inches high) on a baking tray and fill them with the mixture ; you can also use a non-stick mini muffin mold. Keep in mind that each baking cup in the picture contains about 0.7 oz. Compact the mixture inside the baking cups using the back of a spoon to better define the shape of the bites . Now just bake them in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 25 minutes (if using a convection oven, bake at 320°F for 20 minutes), until the surface reaches a pleasant golden color . At this point, the quinoa bites are ready to be plated and served warm!
The quinoa bites can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two days in an airtight container or well covered with plastic wrap. Freezing is not recommended.
The year 2013 was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly as the International Year of Quinoa. Native to the Andes, it is an herbaceous plant belonging to the Chenopodiaceae family (which also includes spinach and beets), it is not a cereal but can be used as one. Bolivia is the main quinoa-producing country. It can be purchased in supermarkets, found next to cereals even though it is not a cereal, or in fair trade stores or shops specializing in the sale of organic products.
The flavor is never enough for you? You can make your bites even more tantalizing by adding a few teaspoons of Tzatziki , fresh and delicate. Alternatively, replace the Grana Padano with Pecorino: delicious!
