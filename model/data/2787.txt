instructions:
The Tarte Tropézienne is a dessert with a really cool backstory. Originating in sunny Saint Tropez, this isn’t just any cake. It’s a soft, pillowy pan brioche sliced in half and packed with a special chiboust cream. And the cream? It's a wild mix of pastry cream and Italian meringue, giving you a light yet rich bite. Dusted with sugar and sometimes with a splash of orange blossom, it’s sweet and a bit floral. Created by Alexandre Micka in 1955, this treat became a hit. And look, legend has it that actress Brigitte Bardot fell for this Saint-Tropez dessert while filming nearby. She even helped name it, linking it forever to the carefree, glamorous vibe of Saint Tropez.
Not many desserts can claim both Brigitte Bardot's approval and legendary status in French bakeries, but this French brioche cream tart totally does. People in Saint Tropez still rave about it—no question—and it’s a staple in almost every bakery there. Each has its own slight twist. Some add more orange blossom, others go heavy on the sugar, and some keep it really moist and tender inside. Although the original recipe is closely guarded, many home bakers use a simpler version of the chiboust cream. For real, you still get that creamy feeling. This style fits right in with classic French pastries, but the Tarte Tropézienne stands out because of its fluffy brioche base and the way the flavors feel so delicate yet kinda luxurious. Serve it at a dinner party, or maybe just a lazy weekend. Everyone will think you’ve got a secret link to the South of France. Really, nothing else tastes quite like this traditional French dessert , and it’s a fun way to bring a little bit of Saint Tropez legend to your table. Pretty simple.
To make the Tarte Tropézienne, start with the starter: in a bowl, place the sifted flour (alternatively, you can use all-purpose flour), the dry yeast (or 0.4 oz of fresh yeast), and the milk , knead the ingredients by hand until you get a soft mixture. Place the starter in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rise for an hour in a warm place, like the oven turned off with the light on.
After the rising time, place the starter in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, add the whole egg , and start the machine, then pour in room-temperature milk , gradually add the sifted flours (as an alternative to manitoba, you can use all-purpose flour) ,
the salt and sugar . Once all the ingredients are absorbed, replace the paddle with the dough hook, add the softened butter, one piece at a time , waiting for it to be absorbed before adding another piece, continue kneading until all the ingredients gather around the hook .
Transfer the dough onto a floured work surface, shape it into a ball, place it in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature, then place it in the refrigerator to rise for 12 hours. In the meantime, prepare the cream: extract the seeds from the vanilla bean and infuse them in the hot milk along with the bean for about half an hour and let the milk cool. Soften the gelatin sheets by placing them in cold water for 10 minutes .
Meanwhile, beat the sugar and egg yolks with a whisk and then incorporate the sifted flour . Extract the vanilla bean from the milk using kitchen tongs, which has cooled .
Pour the milk into the egg yolk and flour mixture , transfer it to a saucepan, and bring to the heat. Thicken the cream over low heat, stirring with a whisk ; when the cream is thick, incorporate the softened and well-squeezed gelatin , stir to dissolve it in the cream. Turn off the heat and transfer the cream to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap in contact and let it cool at room temperature, then place it in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap in contact.
Meanwhile, whip the cream and when it is semi-whipped, add the powdered sugar and continue to whip for about 1 minute . Gently fold the whipped cream into the pastry cream with a spatula . Transfer everything to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and store the cream in the refrigerator.
Take the risen dough , let it come to room temperature for a couple of hours before working it. Place the dough on a floured work surface, shape it into a ball , then take a sheet of parchment paper and draw the outline of a 9.5-inch diameter disc, roll out the dough on the outline and flatten it slightly; it should be about 1.2-1.6 inches thick. Transfer the disc onto a baking sheet , wrap it with plastic wrap, and let it rise again for an hour.
After the necessary time, take the brioche disc, brush the surface with the egg white, and cover it with granulated sugar . Bake the Tarte Tropézienne in a preheated static oven at 320°F for 50 minutes (in a convection oven at 280°F for 40 minutes); if it becomes too dark during baking, cover it with a sheet of aluminum foil. When baking is complete, remove it from the oven, and let it cool completely on a wire rack . Once cooled, cut it in half and fill it with the cream. The Tarte Tropézienne is ready to be enjoyed !
Store the Tarte Tropézienne in the refrigerator for a couple of days. You can store the cream separately in the refrigerator and the unfrosted brioche base under a glass dome for a couple of days. The dough can be frozen before rising in the refrigerator.
With the leftover egg whites, you can make delicious meringues, angel food cake, or even egg white-only omelets.
You can also fill the Tarte Tropezienne with a delicious Mousseline cream as an alternative to chiboust cream.
