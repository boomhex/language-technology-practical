instructions:
To prepare microwave chestnuts, first choose the best chestnuts, without holes. Wash them well under water, and drain them . Score them with a knife and place them in a bowl. Cover with water and let them rest for about ten minutes .
Drain them again and transfer them to a microwave-safe baking dish . Cook the chestnuts in the microwave with the combined function (microwave + grill) at 1000 W or at the maximum power for 5 minutes. Finish cooking by using the grill only for another 2 minutes .
Once ready, let them rest for about ten minutes, then peel them . Place the microwave chestnuts in a small bowl and enjoy!
We recommend consuming microwave chestnuts immediately, while still warm.
During cooking, you can add a sprig of rosemary to make them more flavorful and aromatic!
