Vegetarian gyoza are these amazing Japanese dumplings that really bring people together. And look, when everyone gets involved in folding them, it’s even better. These little bites of joy came from Chinese traditions and have really found a home in Japan with all sorts of tender fillings—like meat, fish, tofu, and veggies.
This vegetarian gyoza version? Light and moist. It’s got crunchy cabbage, carrots, and little tofu bits. Super tasty! The dough’s just water and flour, pretty simple, so you can totally make it at home. Folding them? Yeah, it might be tricky at first, but it quickly becomes fun and satisfying. Plus, dipping them in a sauce made of half soy sauce and half rice vinegar gives a tangy kick that just works great with the gentle flavors inside. And if you’re up for vegan gyoza or just feeling adventurous, this homemade recipe is a fantastic place to start.
Vegetable gyoza often kick off dinners as appetizers, perfect when you crave something crispy and unique. These plant-based dumplings are a hit in Japanese restaurants, but homemade ones have a special charm, really. You can play around with different fillings and shapes. Some regions in Japan add mushrooms or greens like spinach for a sweet and earthy vibe, while others go simple with just cabbage and tofu. Making a big batch for friends? It makes any meal feel festive. Fits right in with an oriental-themed dinner or just a cozy night in. Vegan potstickers like these are super easy to share, and dipping them in that sharp sauce makes every bite pop.
Here’s the deal, the beauty of these meatless gyoza is how simple ingredients can turn into something so golden and satisfying—even for folks who aren’t vegetarian. Whether you call them Japanese dumplings or vegetarian potstickers, the whole process is relaxed and gets easier each time you try it. So, no pressure—just good food and good company. Really, really fun!

To make the vegetarian gyoza, first prepare the dough: in a bowl, mix the flour with the salt , then add the water slowly while you blend the mixture with a spoon .
Knead the dough for a few minutes first in the bowl and then on the work surface until you get a smooth and homogeneous consistency. Form a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature .
In the meantime, prepare the filling. Clean and chop the cabbage , the carrots , and the garlic cloves, removing the core .
Do the same with the green onion , mushrooms , and tofu .
Finally, chop the fresh ginger into pieces . Transfer all the ingredients into a mixer and blend to finely chop them .
Heat a little sunflower oil in a pan, then add the chopped mixture and sauté over medium heat for 10 minutes. After this time, turn off the heat and add the soy sauce and sesame oil .
Also add the sriracha sauce . Mix well , then let it cool down. Once the filling is cold, form balls weighing about 10 g each and place them on a tray .
Take the dough again and divide it into two parts from which you will make logs . Cut the logs into pieces weighing about 15 g and form balls .
Lightly flour the work surface and roll out each ball with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 1 mm , then cut the dough with a cutter of 8 cm diameter . Place a filling ball in the center .
Fold the disc into a half-moon shape , then pinch one of the two edges to form small pleats starting from the center towards the ends ; to help yourself, you can spray the edges of the dough with a bit of water. As you seal the gyoza , place them on a lightly floured tray.
You are ready to cook: heat a pan with a little sunflower oil , then place the gyoza and brown them over medium heat without ever turning them, so that only the bottom is colored; it will take about 4-5 minutes . At this point, pour the water into the pan .
Lower the heat and cook with the lid on for about 10 minutes ; cooking time varies depending on the thickness of the dough. Once cooked, remove the lid , turn off the heat and add the sesame oil .
Pour the soy sauce and rice vinegar into a bowl , mix , and serve your vegetarian gyoza with the accompanying sauce !
The vegetarian gyoza can be stored in the refrigerator for one day after cooking.
You can freeze them raw and cook them directly from frozen, increasing the cooking time.
We chose to roll the dough very thin, but you can decide to increase the thickness to get a dough that is more resistant to the bite: in this case, it will be easier to seal the dumplings, but the cooking times will be longer. Keep in mind, moreover, that the dough amount will suffice for fewer pieces.
If you prefer, you can chop the filling ingredients with a knife instead of using a mixer.
