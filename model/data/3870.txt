First, prepare the potato gnocchi according to the recipe you will find by clicking Potato gnocchi . Once ready, place them on a tray covered with a lightly floured cloth and keep them in a cool place. Meanwhile, lightly pound the meat slices (if they are too large, cut them in half) and on each, place a piece of bacon , a piece of cheese , two sage leaves , and pepper.
Roll them up, closing the rolls on the sides and then also at the ends with toothpicks . Sauté the finely chopped onion over low heat , then when it becomes transparent (after 10-15 minutes), add the rolls .
Make sure the rolls brown on both sides , then pour wine over them , spreading it well in the pan .
When the wine has evaporated, add the tomato sauce ; add enough hot water to cover them. Cover the pan with a lid and cook, adjusting salt and pepper and stirring occasionally. Once the rolls are cooked and the sauce has thickened, boil the potato gnocchi in plenty of salted water , drain them well, and add them to the sauce . Then remove the toothpicks from the rolls and serve your gnocchi with useleti to the guests.
