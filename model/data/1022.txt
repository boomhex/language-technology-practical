instructions:
To prepare the spatzle salad, first make the dough following our Spinach Spätzle with Speck and Cream recipe; once ready, keep it in the refrigerator. Wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them into quarters lengthwise . Also, cut the primosale into cubes .
In a large bowl, add the cherry tomatoes , the primosale , and the olives .
Season with basil leaves , lemon zest , pepper, and salt, mix everything, and set aside. Put a pot full of water on the burner, salt it, and bring to a boil. When the water boils, cook the spatzle with the appropriate tool (or a potato masher): they will be cooked when they rise to the surface. At this point, drain them into a bowl , drizzle with a bit of oil, and let them cool.
When the spatzle are cool, add them to the dressing , mix everything , and serve the spatzle salad with some basil leaves .
We recommend consuming the spatzle salad immediately. If there are leftovers, you can store them in the fridge for a couple of days.
Vary your salad with fresh and appetizing ingredients you prefer: provolone, sun-dried tomatoes, roasted peppers, grilled eggplant...summer vegetables will be an inspiration!
