instructions:
To prepare the semi-frozen cake, start with the meringue. Pour the water and sugar into a saucepan, leaving a couple of tablespoons aside . Heat over medium heat and always monitor the temperature with a kitchen thermometer . The syrup should reach 250°F.
When it reaches 239°F, you can start whipping the egg whites. Pour them into a bowl, add the remaining sugar , and whip them with electric beaters until they are very stiff. When the syrup reaches 250°F, pour it slowly into the egg whites, still beating .
Continue whipping with the beaters until the mixture cools down. Now clean the beaters and whip the cream; it should be semi-whipped . Soften the mascarpone in a large bowl by working it with a spatula .
Then gradually add the meringue , mixing gently from bottom to top . Finally, add the semi-whipped cream in three batches, being careful not to deflate it .
You should get a smooth and well-whipped mixture . Cover with plastic wrap and transfer it to the fridge until needed. Now take care of the chocolate: coarsely chop 14 oz of chocolate and melt it in a double boiler or microwave .
Meanwhile, line an 8-inch springform pan with parchment paper on the base and a strip of acetate on the sides. Pour 4 tablespoons of chocolate inside and spread it over the entire base with the back of a spoon . Put it in the fridge. Now prepare the other discs; you will need a total of 5. Draw 5 circles of 7 inches on parchment paper with a pencil, using a pastry ring as a guide . Flip the parchment paper onto a baking tray and pour 2 tablespoons of chocolate for each circle. Spread the chocolate using the back of a spoon .
Once you have obtained 5 chocolate discs, transfer them to the fridge and wait for them to set well . When the chocolate has solidified, take the pan again and transfer a layer of cream inside .
Place a chocolate disc and continue this way, alternating your cream with the discs. Make sure to finish the dessert with a layer of chocolate . Cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for at least 6 hours.
Grate the remaining 3.5 oz of chocolate . If there's any leftover chocolate, drizzle it over the dessert with a fork; if it has solidified, you can melt it again. Add the grated chocolate , unmold the dessert, transfer it to a plate, and serve the semi-frozen cake .
You can store the semifreddo in the freezer for 4 days.
It should be consumed shortly after serving.
Want to give your semifreddo an extra boost? You can flavor the cream with the seeds of a vanilla bean and the pod, the night before in the fridge, in a bowl covered with plastic wrap. When you need to use it, just remove the pod, and your cream will have taken on a pleasant vanilla aroma!
