Focaccia della Befana is a really tasty treat from Piedmont , Italy. You know, it adds a special touch to those January mornings. This daisy-shaped, tender, and moist bread isn’t just a breakfast staple. It’s really, really a slice of family tradition. On Epiphany morning, while kids eagerly check their stockings, everyone looks forward to tasting this golden, slightly sweet bread. Families across Northern Italy gather around the table, sharing laughs as they search for that hidden coin or dry bean inside. It’s pretty much a playful tradition, giving the Epiphany focaccia recipe an extra layer of fun. And the best part? The lucky finder is said to receive good fortune. The enticing aroma of citrus and vanilla fills the kitchen, inviting everyone to gather and enjoy.
And look, unlike the savory focaccias found in other parts of Italy, this traditional Italian dessert is celebrated for its softness and gentle sweetness. Plus, those scattered bits of candied fruit are just awesome. Some families in Piedmont like to add extra candied orange or sprinkle pearl sugar on top for a crispier finish. The margherita shape—crafted with a few simple cuts before baking—ensures each slice resembles a petal. Looks pretty special, right? This sweet focaccia bread pairs perfectly with a warm drink—making it a versatile choice for breakfast or a snack. Seriously good stuff.
For those who cherish festive Italian baking , Focaccia della Befana keeps that holiday spirit alive even after New Year’s. Its soft and fluffy texture almost melts in your mouth, with a mild sweetness. Really, it’s a favorite among Piedmontese desserts. Whether you’re in Italy or want to bring a bit of this tradition into your home, this recipe promises to bring smiles and a touch of Italian magic to your table. And here's the thing: can't go wrong with that.
To prepare the Epiphany focaccia, first pour the flour into the bowl of a stand mixer equipped with a hook , add the sourdough starter , and gradually pour in the milk while the machine is running at moderate speed.
Once the milk is completely absorbed, also add the previously beaten egg , sugar , and salt .
Knead the dough for a few minutes, increasing the speed of the machine to medium. Then add a small piece of butter and wait for it to be well absorbed before adding the next piece. Continue this way until all the butter is used. Add the candied fruit and continue kneading to incorporate them. Then transfer the dough to a bowl .
and cover with plastic wrap . Leave the dough to rise overnight at room temperature, or for 7-8 hours, until it doubles in volume. At this point, transfer it to a low baking tray of 12 1/2 inches , lined with parchment paper, placing it in the center .
Stretch the dough with your hands to cover the entire surface . Move the focaccia to a work surface and place a small bowl with a diameter of about 4 inches in the center.
Using a sharp knife or cutting wheel, cut strips around the bowl , you should get 16 petals of the same size . Twist each petal with your hands until they are all finished.
Cover again with plastic wrap and let it rise for another two hours. After this time, brush the focaccia with milk and decorate with sugar granules. Bake the focaccia in the center rack of a preheated fan oven at 355°F for about 20 minutes. At this point, take it out of the oven , let it cool slightly, and serve it.
You can store the Epiphany focaccia for 2/3 days at room temperature under a glass dome.
