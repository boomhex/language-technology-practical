Barchette di pane ripiene are super popular at gatherings across Italy . Seriously, they're everywhere—especially during those laid-back dinners and lively buffets. And you know what? These stuffed bread boats turn simple panini ai cereali (those multigrain rolls you spot in every bakery) into something way way special. Hollow out the middle and boom, you've got cute little boat shapes ready for filling. And the sauce? Typically, you'll find a mix of tender veggies, gooey cheese, and salty prosciutto. So so good, right? After baking, they get all moist inside and crispy around the edges. Plus, in regions like Emilia-Romagna or Lombardy, fillings vary based on what's in season—pretty much anything goes.
Don't be shocked if these cheesy stuffed bread boats disappear fast. They look impressive, but really, they're pretty simple to make. That's why home cooks often go for this easy bread boat recipe when they want to please a crowd. Seriously good stuff. The blend of golden baked bread with tangy cheese? Perfection. You can switch up the fillings with whatever's lying around, like leftover roast veggies or bits of ham and olives. Both kids and adults just love them. The outside is crispy, while the inside stays all gooey. It's kind of perfect.
Here's the deal: no need for any fancy tricks—just decent bread, some simple ingredients, and a bit of oven time. For group dinners or spontaneous hangouts, these homemade bread boats are a smart pick. They're not just tasty, they're easy to share too. People all over Italy keep making them because they're just really really fun and savory every time. Honestly, can't go wrong with these.
To prepare the boats start by hollowing out the bread using a knife , being careful to leave a firm base because the bread will tend to become heavier with the addition of the filling (2-3).
Take a non-stick pan, heat 2/3 tablespoons of oil and sauté the zucchini and eggplant cut into cubes for about 10 minutes . Once cooked, let them cool. In a bowl, put the beaten eggs and add the ricotta .
Then add the cooled vegetables , the chopped chives , and the Parmesan .
Finally, incorporate the cooked ham and the diced bacon, then add a pinch of salt and pepper (11-12).
With the help of a ladle, fill the rolls to the brim (make sure to take a well-balanced ladle of vegetables and liquid: do not take too much liquid otherwise the roll will become too soggy) (13-14). In a bowl, beat the egg and with the help of a brush, brush the rolls with this mixture . Now place the stuffed bread boats in a preheated convection oven at 350°F and bake for 25 minutes, so that the filling of the roll becomes firm and well browned on the surface. Remove from the oven and serve your stuffed bread boats warm or cold, whole or sliced.
The stuffed bread boats can be stored for up to two days in the refrigerator, or frozen once cooked. When you fancy them, just defrost them in the oven or microwave for a few minutes.
The most suitable rolls for this are cylindrical multigrain buns (they are usually about 4 inches long). The shape is perfect, so the dish will be nice to present at the table, and the grains make everything tastier and more enjoyable.
