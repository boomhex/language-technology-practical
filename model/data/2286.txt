instructions:
To prepare the nduja and cacio silano timbale, you can start by cooking the pasta in a pot of salted boiling water . Then proceed with the seasoning: cut the cacio in half to make it easier to slice , and with a knife, remove the tougher outer rind .
Cut into strips , then into cubes . Then take the nduja and do the same, slicing it first, then cutting it into strips
and finally into cubes . Remember to set aside 1.5 oz of nduja and 1.5 oz of cacio silano to add before baking. Take a baking dish, grease it with a kitchen brush , and sprinkle it with breadcrumbs .
When the pasta is ready, drain it and transfer it to a bowl , add the nduja and diced cacio , and add the oregano .
Add the grated cheese , mix well to incorporate all the ingredients , and transfer the mixture to the baking dish .
Add the diced nduja and cacio that you had set aside for decoration, and cook in a preheated static oven at 450°F for 10 minutes until a crust forms on the surface. Your nduja and cacio silano timbale is ready to be enjoyed!
You can store the nduja and cacio silano timbale in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to one day. You can freeze it once cooked, storing it in an airtight container. To defrost, place it in the fridge the night before, and once defrosted, heat it in the oven.
The decisive spiciness is the leitmotif of this recipe! But if you prefer something milder, you can use classic salami and, instead of cacio, try with provola!
