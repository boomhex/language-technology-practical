Celeriac velouté, a classic from Northern Italy , is all about showcasing this humble root in style. Folks in Lombardy and Piedmont have been making creamy celeriac soup for, like, generations. Seriously, it's the go-to when the weather gets chilly, and you just want something comforting after those holiday feasts. This dish has a velvety texture and subtle celeriac flavor—it's like a knobby turnip but, you know, way more delicate.
Leeks add an aromatic punch to this celeriac soup , while toasted hazelnuts and sage bring a nutty, woodsy vibe. Perfect for Italian winter cooking, for sure. People love how it’s smooth and rich but doesn’t weigh you down. Super tasty for big Sunday lunches or cozy weeknights. Toasted hazelnuts on top? They add a crunchy contrast to the creamy celeriac soup . And look, in some Italian kitchens, you might find pancetta or crispy sage sprinkled for a fun twist.
It works great as a starter at family gatherings or even as the main course when you want something light yet warming. Thing is, it's like a little reset for your body—celeriac is packed with nutrients. Really nice, right? Its gentle, almost sweet flavor gives everything an elegant touch without any fuss. Northern Italians have seriously mastered making the most out of their winter veggies, and this celeriac soup recipe proves it.
And the soup? It’s steaming, silky—plus, those hazelnut bits pop in every bite. Really, really good. It's one of those dishes that makes you feel both full and happy, deserving a spot at any winter table. Enjoy this taste of Italy; let it bring warmth to your home during the chilly months. Pretty much perfect.
To prepare the celeriac velouté, first, clean the vegetables: rinse the leeks under running water, remove the green part and the root part found at the opposite end, then make a longitudinal incision with the knife and remove the tougher outer leaves ; finally, cut the leek stem into chunks about an inch thick . You should obtain approximately 10 oz of cleaned leek.
Now move on to the celeriac: wash it thoroughly under running water to remove soil residues, then remove the peel with the sharp blade of a knife and cut it first into slices and then into chunks about an inch thick . You should obtain approximately 2.5 lbs of cleaned celeriac.
Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the sage leaves (save a couple of leaves for the final garnish) and let them flavor the oil for about 5 minutes over medium-low heat , then remove them with kitchen tongs . At this point, add the leek chunks
and the celeriac , increase the heat and toast them for another 5 minutes, then pour in cold water , cover with a lid and let it cook over medium heat for about 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, arrange the peeled hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast them in a preheated fan oven at 375°F for about 15 minutes or until golden brown ; once toasted, coarsely crush the hazelnuts by pressing them with the flat side of a knife blade .
Finally, finely chop the sage leaves you set aside . After the cooking time for the vegetables, turn off the heat and blend everything with an immersion blender until you get a creamy mixture .
Pour the cream into a sieve and strain it with a spatula to obtain a velvety texture . Add the fresh cream and grated nutmeg and mix well.
Now you can transfer the velouté to a deep dish , garnish the surface with toasted hazelnuts , add a bit of chopped sage, and a grind of pepper: your delicious celeriac velouté is ready to be enjoyed !
The celeriac velouté can be stored in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to 2 days. It can be frozen without the hazelnuts and sage if you have used fresh ingredients.
Velouté is usually a simple dish, but with a bit of creativity, it can be transformed into a gourmet dish! Some examples? Garnish the celeriac velouté with Parmesan wafers, walnuts, pistachios, or pine nuts and season it with a drizzle of raw oil... you will surely make a great impression!
