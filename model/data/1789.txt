instructions:
To make the lemon sorbet without egg whites, pour 200 ml (6.8 oz) of water into a saucepan, add 200 g (1 cup) of sugar , stir and bring to a boil: you will obtain a rather liquid syrup. Let it boil for 3 minutes , then let it cool in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
Squeeze the lemon to obtain 100 ml (3.4 oz) of juice and strain it. In a pitcher, pour 315 ml (10.6 oz) of now cold water and sugar syrup , 85 ml (2.9 oz) of water
and the lemon juice . Blend the mixture with an immersion blender until you get a light and frothy mixture .
Pour the obtained mixture into the bowl of the previously cooled ice cream maker (follow the instructions on your ice cream maker to check how to proceed) . Let the sorbet churn for about 30-40 minutes until completely cooled. Once you have a smooth and shiny cream , your sorbet will be ready to be served!
Store the lemon sorbet without egg whites in the freezer for up to 3 days.
To speed up the churning process, you can prepare the syrup the day before, so you can use it already cold.
