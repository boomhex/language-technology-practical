To prepare the warm rice salad with three broccolis, first clean and cut the broccolis: remove the base and leaves of the Romanesco broccoli , then separate the florets , dividing the larger ones into smaller pieces .
Do the same with the cauliflower and the broccoli . Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the rice for the time indicated on the package .
Pour a drizzle of oil into a large pan and flavor it with 2 cloves of garlic , then add the cauliflower and the broccoli .
Also add the Romanesco broccoli , thyme sprigs , salt, and pepper .
Pour in 2 ladles of the rice cooking water and stir gently . Cover with a lid and cook over a low flame for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally .
Once the rice cooking time has elapsed, drain it and set it aside in a bowl, dressed with a drizzle of oil . While the broccolis are cooking, take care of the chicken: cut the chicken breasts in half horizontally , then season with salt and pepper.
Place the chicken breasts on a well-heated grill and cook on both sides for a total of 10-15 minutes (the time may vary depending on the thickness of the meat) . Once cooked, keep the chicken aside for the moment .
After the 20 minutes of cooking the broccolis, remove the lid and discard the garlic cloves, then raise the heat and sauté them briefly to make them golden; it's preferable not to stir but to just move the pan . At this point, cut the chicken breast into slices and add it to the rice, which you have mixed with the broccolis . Your warm salad with three broccolis is ready to be enjoyed !
The warm rice salad with three broccolis can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
For a vegetarian version, you can omit the chicken and add dried fruits like hazelnuts or cashews!
