instructions:
To prepare the rice salad with fruit medley, first cook the rice in boiling water, salted to taste , for about 10 minutes. After the cooking time, drain the rice and cool it under cold water. Transfer the rice to a bowl , season it with a drizzle of oil , and let it cool.
Take the watermelon, remove the rind , and cut it into 1/2 inch cubes , trying to remove the seeds as well. You will get about 8 oz. Slice the cucumber into 1/2 inch slices, without peeling it .
Cut these slices into 1/2 inch cubes . Move on to the melon, remove the rind and seeds , and cut it into 1/2 inch cubes .
Take care of the strawberries, wash them well and remove the stems . Cut them into small wedges , or if they are very large, make cubes. Also, wash the grapes well and cut the grapes in half .
Wash the cherries well, pit them by dividing them in half , and cut them into wedges . Also, cut the primosale cheese into 1/2 inch cubes .
Prepare the citronette. Inside a kitchen squeeze bottle or a glass jar, pour the oil , the lemon juice , and the mint leaves .
Shake until you get an emulsion . Take the rice and add the grapes, strawberries , cherries, cucumbers, and primosale cheese .
Add also the melon and watermelon . Mix well and dress with the freshly prepared citronette .
Add more mint leaves , mix again , and place in the refrigerator until ready to serve .
