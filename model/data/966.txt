instructions:
To make the savoy cabbage lasagna, start by preparing the ragù. Finely chop the celery, peeled and trimmed carrot, and peeled onion with a knife . Pour the oil into a pot and add the chopped vegetables for the sauté along with the crushed garlic . Sauté for about ten minutes over low heat, stirring occasionally.
When the sauté is well browned , add the minced beef . Slowly brown it for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally. Deglaze with red wine .
As soon as the alcohol evaporates, season with rosemary , pour in the tomato sauce and the water .
Add a pinch of salt, stir, cover with the lid , and let it cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, then lower the heat and continue cooking for 2 hours. In the meantime, prepare the béchamel. Heat the milk in a small pot , separately melt the 7 tbsp of butter over low heat .
Turn off the heat and add the 3/4 cup of flour to the melted butter, stirring with a whisk to prevent lumps . Then place it back on low heat and stir until it turns golden. Flavor the milk with nutmeg and a pinch of salt, pour a little warm milk onto the mixture to temper it, then add the rest , vigorously mix everything with the whisk. Cook for 5-6 minutes over low heat until the sauce thickens and starts to boil.
Set the béchamel aside . Now deal with the savoy cabbage. Peel off 16 leaves from the cabbage. Remove the inner core to get two less curved leaves .
Boil them a little at a time in salted boiling water . Depending on the thickness of the leaves, the cooking time varies from 5 to 10 minutes. Once they're tender, drain them and transfer them to a tray lined with a kitchen towel and let them dry .
Cut the provolone cheese into cubes . Meanwhile, the ragù will also be ready , and you can start assembling the lasagna. Take a rectangular baking dish of 8x12 inches, pour a layer of béchamel on the bottom .
Lay down 4 savoy cabbage leaves , spread the ragù over them and top with the provolone and grated cheese .
Continue with another layer of cabbage leaves, then the béchamel , ragù, and cheeses. Continue this way until you use up all the ingredients; you should get 4 layers. For the last layer, distribute the savoy cabbage , ragù, and béchamel .
and sprinkle only with grated cheese . Bake in a preheated static oven at 390°F for 30 minutes, then continue for 5 minutes with the grill. Remove the savoy cabbage lasagna from the oven , let them cool slightly before serving .
The savoy cabbage lasagna can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. You can freeze them after cooking if you used fresh ingredients.
The ragù and béchamel can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days and can be frozen after cooking.
Make sure to select leaves of the same thickness for even cooking and a better final result.
