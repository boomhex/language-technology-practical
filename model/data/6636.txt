instructions:
To prepare tomato bruschetta , first wash the tomatoes, divide them in half and then cut them into cubes . Pour the cut tomatoes into a bowl and add basil leaves, previously washed and dried .
Season with a pinch of oregano , salt , pepper and oil . Stir well and let the flavors blend for about 30 minutes. This step is optional, but we recommend it to enhance scents and flavors.
Meanwhile, cut the bread into slices . After the resting time, heat a grill and place the slices of bread on it . Grill them on both sides until toasted .
Now top the bread slices with your tomato salad , drizzling a little more oil . Let rest for a couple of minutes, then serve your tomato bruschettas !
Tomato bruschettas taste best as soon as ready.
You can flavor the slices of bread by rubbing a clove of garlic on freshly toasted slices or enrich the tomato salad with well-drained tuna in oil!
