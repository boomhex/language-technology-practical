Sfoglie alle olive con polpettine di radicchio e crema di yogurt really captures the essence of Veneto's culinary wonders. Imagine this: you start with a base of olive puff pastry that bakes into a crispy, golden delight. Honestly, it's hard to resist. Then, you've got these tender radicchio meatballs. They're made with radicchio trevigiano from Treviso. And look, this radicchio's bitterness perfectly balances the savory pastries and the sharpness of Grana cheese. For real, the cheese does more than just enhance the flavor—it binds those meatballs together like magic, bringing that special touch of northern Italian cuisine.
And the breadcrumbs? Yeah, they add this subtle crunch, making a nice contrast with the soft insides. Pretty simple. These bites are just perfect as an Italian appetizer or a snack to enjoy with friends over drinks—no question about it.
Plus, there's a fresh yogurt sauce recipe that ties it all together beautifully. The yogurt mixed with thyme and marjoram introduces tangy, herby notes that balance out the cheese's richness and radicchio's boldness. This fresh yogurt cools things down, giving a balanced experience of contrasts—bitter and sweet, soft and crispy, sharp and mellow. Seriously good.
People in Veneto often switch things up, maybe by changing the herbs or using a different cheese, but the classic combo of radicchio and Grana? It's a favorite. If you're hunting for a gourmet finger food that feels both special and casual, this dish is a winner. I mean, whether you call it a radicchio meatballs snack or one of those healthy snacks perfect for an aperitivo, it just nails that blend of originality and deliciousness. It's ideal for anyone wanting a taste of Veneto, offering a slice of Italian hospitality and tradition. For sure.
To prepare the pastries with radicchio meatballs on yogurt cream, start with the yogurt cream: in a small bowl, gather the Greek yogurt, add the chopped thyme and marjoram, and salt to taste. Mix, transfer the yogurt to a piping bag, and set aside to chill. Then proceed to prepare the meatballs: wash the Treviso radicchio leaves, slice them thinly, then let them wilt in a pan with a drizzle of oil and a peeled garlic clove. It will take just a few minutes to wilt them. Then remove the garlic,
Pour the radicchio into a small bowl and add the ground meat. Then also pour in the egg yolk, salt, and pepper to taste, and start kneading with your hands.
Add the Parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs, mix to combine the ingredients, and then start creating meatballs weighing about 0.14 oz (4 grams) each, rolling the meat and radicchio mixture between the palms of your hands. Then, in a large pan, heat plenty of peanut (or olive) oil and fry the meatballs, not too many at a time so as not to lower the oil temperature too much:
Complete the cooking of the meatballs and then let them drain from the excess oil by placing them on a tray lined with paper towels. Now you can start assembling the pastries: put a dollop of yogurt on each pastry, then place a meatball and garnish with a thyme leaf. Continue until the ingredients are used up and serve your pastries with radicchio meatballs and yogurt cream!
You can store the olive pastries with radicchio meatballs and yogurt cream in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of ground meat, you can use potatoes to prepare the radicchio meatballs.
