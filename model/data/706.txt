instructions:
To prepare baked black olives, choose well-ripened olives, preferably those that have already fallen from the tree but do not have any particular imperfections. Wash the olives very well to remove any dirt or soil residue. Fill a pot with water and put it on the stove; as soon as it reaches a boil, immerse the olives and boil them for about 5 minutes, then drain them .
Transfer the olives onto a towel and dry them well . Transfer them to a bowl and season them with a drizzle of oil .
Add two tablespoons of oregano , a pinch of salt , and two minced garlic cloves .
Mix well , then place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 320°F for about 35/40 minutes. Once they are ready, remove the olives from the oven and let them cool completely . Drizzle the olives with a little oil to soften them before serving.
Store the baked black olives in a glass jar in the refrigerator for up to one month.
If you like, you can add some chili pepper pieces to your olives to make them spicy. Or give them a citrus note by adding a few orange slices.
