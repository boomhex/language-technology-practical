instructions:
To prepare the egg white pancakes, pour the egg whites and sugar into a large bowl , then beat the mixture with electric whisks .
When the egg whites are stiff, add a pinch of salt , sifted flour , and vegetable oil . Blend the mixture again with the electric whisks until you get a rather thick batter.
At this point, pour in the milk in a steady stream while keeping the whisks running . After the milk has been fully absorbed, sift in the baking powder and mix one last time with the whisks to combine .
Heat a non-stick skillet with a dash of oil , removing any excess with a paper towel . Pour a ladle of batter into the center .
Cook over moderate heat for about 2 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface . Then, flip the pancake and cook the other side for another 2 minutes, or until golden brown . Continue in the same way until the batter is finished, stacking the pancakes on a plate; with these quantities, you'll get about 12 . Serve your egg white pancakes with maple syrup, honey, or fresh fruit as you like!
The egg white pancakes can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer, you can replace the vegetable oil in the pancake batter with the same amount of extra virgin olive oil or a knob of butter.
