If you're craving something light yet packed with flavor, these cheese puffs —or gougères as they're known in France—are a total must-try. Seriously good. The magic? It lies in the delicate choux pastry made with water, butter, flour, and eggs. And look, when baked, these airy, hollow pastries come out looking fancy, but they're actually pretty simple to munch on. The thing is, what sets this version apart is the blend of Grana and Fontina cheeses, giving it a tangy, nutty kick. Way, way better than just the usual cheddar.
While this recipe is a twist with its unique cheese combo, it's all about keeping that classic French touch. Plus, these savory pastries are perfect for parties or as a pre-dinner snack. They're just as delicious solo or with a bit of savory cream on the side. And you know, you'll often find regional variations with different cheeses or herbs for an extra punch.
The outside turns golden and slightly crispy, while the inside stays moist. That's what makes this cheese puff recipe such a hit—it offers texture and flavor that makes you want more. Really, really more. Pair these homemade cheese puffs with a glass of wine, and you've got a winner for any spread of French appetizers . They're also great for brunch, picnics, or any gathering where you want something special yet relaxed.
Even if you're familiar with cheddar cheese puffs, this take with Grana and Fontina brings a rich taste and a tender bite. Can't go wrong with good choux pastry. It’s the kind of snack that disappears quickly, so don’t be surprised if you find yourself whipping up a double batch next time. Whether you're hosting or just indulging at home, these gougères are bound to impress and satisfy every time.
To prepare the cheese puffs, grate the Grana and Fontina. Then, put the butter pieces in a large saucepan, add the water slowly , and turn on the low heat; while the butter melts, add a teaspoon of salt .
When the butter has melted, turn off the heat and sift the flour into the saucepan through a fine mesh sieve and mix quickly with a whisk to avoid forming lumps. Once the liquids have been absorbed, turn on the very low heat and continue mixing with a wooden spoon until you obtain a soft, homogeneous dough that easily detaches from the sides of the saucepan. At this point, turn off the heat.
Transfer the mixture to a stand mixer bowl with a paddle attachment and add one egg at a time , incorporating the previous one before continuing (if you use large eggs, you may decide to add only three depending on the fluidity of the mixture). Once the eggs are incorporated, add the grated Grana and Fontina .
Once the dough is ready, pour it into a piping bag with a rather large plain nozzle . Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and form about 30 dough mounds spaced apart (you can bake the puffs in multiple batches) and bake them in a preheated static oven for 15 minutes at 428°F, avoiding opening the oven during baking. After the first 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 374°F and bake the choux pastry for another 10 minutes. If you want to bake your puffs in a preheated convection oven, set it to 347°F and bake the puffs for 30 minutes. At this point, turn off the oven and leave the puffs inside for another 30 minutes with the door slightly open (place a wooden spoon between the door and the oven); this will help dry the inside of the puffs thoroughly. Once the puffs are completely cooled, you can remove them from the oven and serve them filled, for example, with cream cheese, gorgonzola, or cold cuts.
Cheese puffs should be well dried to be stored best in an airtight container or a tin box kept in a cool, dry place for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Simple or filled, for example, with spreadable cream cheese and cooked ham, or with gorgonzola and cold cuts to your liking... cheese puffs will go fast because you can't stop at just one!
