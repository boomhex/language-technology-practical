Scallops and pears in Grana Padano pastry is that kind of seafood appetizer that just pops at the table. Really, it makes a statement. In Northern Italy, they love playing with contrasts, and honestly, this dish does it in a way that’s both elegant and fun. So here’s the deal: you get the tender texture of fresh scallops —especially with the orange "coral" attached—which adds a pop of color and a bit of briny flavor. And the pears? They’re sweet and sliced just thick enough to hold their own next to the shellfish. Pretty simple.
All of this gets wrapped up in flaky pastry , usually a puff style, with plenty of Grana Padano cheese grated inside. That cheese? It’s a classic from Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, known for its rich taste that’s a bit salty, but never sharp. Really nice. The whole thing bakes until the pastry is golden and crisp.
What really, really stands out is the way this scallop and pear recipe uses a red currant sauce for that tangy kick. It’s not just about sweetness or cheese—there’s a real back-and-forth between flavors. The sauce? Drizzle it over or serve it on the side, and taste a little with each bite. And for special dinners, when you want a gourmet appetizer that people remember, this dish feels refined and creative. For sure.
In places like Milan or Lake Garda, you’ll find different takes on this kind of baked scallops and fruit pairing, but using Grana Padano pastry definitely brings out the Italian side. What you get is a shellfish dish all about balance: moist scallops, crispy puff pastry, and that hit of sweet fruit and cheese. Seriously good. It’s the sort of food you want to slow down for and really enjoy, especially as an elegant starter with good company. So... Whether it’s a holiday gathering or an intimate dinner party, this dish will leave a lasting impression, inviting everyone to savor each delicious bite.
To make the scallops and pears in Grana Padano pastry, first prepare the pears: wash and cut the pear in half, then divide one of the halves into 6 wedges and remove the core with a small knife . Grate the Grana Padano PDO with a coarse grater and heat a non-stick pan. When it is very hot, pour a tablespoon of grated Grana Padano PDO in the center and shape it into a circle, then add a pinch of pepper .
When the wafer forms a light crust on the bottom, place a pear wedge in the center and wrap it with the edges of the wafer, lifting them gently with the help of a spatula (5-6): it will take a couple of minutes in total, keeping the flame medium-low. Repeat the operation to make a total of 6 pears in pastry.
Now separate the roe from the scallop muscle and set the latter aside. Heat another small pan and add both the roe and the currants , pour the water , and add salt
and sauté everything over medium heat for a couple of minutes as the liquid should not reduce too much . Transfer the mixture to a tall and narrow glass and blend with an immersion blender , helping if necessary with a tablespoon of olive oil: you should obtain a consistency similar to mayonnaise .
In another small pan, heat a thread of oil with clarified butter and sauté the scallop muscles over high heat for 1 minute on each side, until golden . Transfer them to a cutting board and cut 2 scallops in half horizontally .
At this point, divide the grape berries in half and remove the seeds, then you can proceed to plate the dish: start with a few strokes of currant sauce, then place 2 pears in pastry per person and garnish with a couple of grape berries .
Finally, add 3 scallops per plate , drizzle with a little oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, and decorate with some fresh currants: your scallops and pears in Grana Padano pastry are ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the scallops and pears in Grana Padano pastry immediately.
If desired, you can replace the currants with raspberries and add some aromatic herbs to flavor the dish, such as mint, thyme, or chives!
