instructions:
To make the chia seed cookies, first put the eggs in a pot of cold water and boil for 8 minutes once the water comes to a boil . Then drain them, let them cool, and peel them. At this point, take only the yolks , the egg whites will not be needed for this recipe, but you can use them to make stuffed eggs, like the Spring Eggs .
Cut the cold butter into cubes and place it in a food processor with blades ; add the flour and cornstarch and blend until you get a crumbly mixture .
Then add the Parmesan , hard-boiled yolks, and chia seeds . Blend again until the ingredients are combined .
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead briefly . Then wrap it in plastic wrap . Let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 40 minutes. Take the dough and roll it out on a floured surface !
You should achieve a thickness of 3/8 inch . Using a fluted cookie cutter with a diameter of about 2 inches, cut out the cookies (14-15)
and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F, on the lower rack for about 25/28 minutes, then take them out and let your chia seed cookies cool before moving them to a tray.
Store the cookies out of the fridge, under a glass dome or inside a paper bag, and consume them within 6 days. If you prefer, you can freeze the dough.
Flavor the cookies with a mix of chopped herbs!
