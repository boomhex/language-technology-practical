It's a reminder that the most basic foods can carry the biggest stories, making every meal just a bit more special. From festive gatherings to everyday meals, unleavened bread remains a beloved staple, keeping traditions alive while satisfying taste buds with its simple yet meaningful presence.
To make unleavened bread, start by preheating the oven to 480°F, then place the sifted flour in a bowl , pour in the cold water slowly, and begin kneading vigorously at a steady speed for 2-3 minutes to combine the ingredients.
Then continue kneading by hand on a pastry board with firm and rapid movements, folding the dough over itself for another 2-3 minutes (the time may vary depending on your familiarity with hand kneading). You should obtain an elastic dough ball , divide it into 4 equal pieces, and roll them out with a long and narrow rolling pin . For best results, it is advisable not to let the dough rest but to roll it out immediately.
Roll each piece to a thickness of about 1/8 inch, it doesn't need to have a defined shape, it should result in a disk with a diameter of approximately 9 inches . With these quantities, you will obtain 4 sheets of unleavened bread. Use the prongs of a fork or a toothed wheel to pierce the entire surface of the bread . Bake the bread disks in a static oven at 480°F, placing them directly in contact with the bottom part of the oven for 7 minutes, then flip them and continue baking for another 7 minutes (you can bake them one at a time). Once baked, take the unleavened bread out of the oven and let it cool before serving.
Unleavened bread can be stored in a paper bag away from humidity for about 1 month. Freezing is not recommended.
Enjoy unleavened bread as an alternative to classic bread bruschetta; light and crispy, it will pair with many delicious and enticing ingredients, creating the right balance of flavors!
