Zuppa di mais is a really, really delightful way to show how corn soup can be both creamy and fun. And you know what? In Italy, they take fresh corn right off the cob and cook it with carrots and leeks—creating this fragrant base. The result? A zuppa di mais that's full of color with a smooth, rich texture. Everything gets blended into a thick, velvety soup. Not your usual corn chowder. What's extra special are the croutons dusted with spicy paprika, giving it a sweet and slightly spicy kick. Seriously good. Perfect for a cool night or when you want something interesting on the table.
Italian corn recipes don't stop at soup. Nope, there are corn fritters with tomato chutney and fried corn cobs in some regions, showing creativity with this ingredient. The Italian corn soup really stands out because of its balance. Fresh corn gives a natural sweetness. Plus, those paprika croutons add a crispy crunch, making it feel like a restaurant dish—pretty much. It's a great first course when you want to impress friends or switch things up from the usual pasta or minestrone. This easy corn soup recipe doesn’t need much fuss, yet gives you those classic homemade vibes.
Whether you're diving into more authentic Italian recipes or just after something quick and a bit fancy, zuppa di mais is perfect for nights when you crave something that mixes creamy and spicy in a fun way. And look, it's super tasty.
To prepare the corn soup, start by shelling the steamed pre-cooked cobs: place them on a cutting board and slice them lengthwise with a knife , otherwise, you can also shell them by hand. Continue by cleaning and cutting the vegetables that will make up the sauté: peel the carrots with a peeler , then cut them into thin sticks and finally into cubes .
Then place the leek on a cutting board and remove both ends (4-5), then slice it into rounds .
Transfer the diced carrots and sliced leeks into a large, high-sided pot, drizzle them with a little extra virgin olive oil, and sauté over medium heat for a few minutes .
When the sautéed vegetables are nicely golden, add the corn kernels and let them flavor for 5-6 minutes over low heat. Then salt and pepper to taste , add enough vegetable broth to cover the mixture , and let it cook for about 35 minutes. To find out how to best prepare the vegetable broth, consult the Cooking School: Vegetable broth .
Stir occasionally and when the mixture has softened and absorbed part of the broth , insert the immersion blender into the pot and blend until you obtain a thick and homogeneous mixture , adding broth if needed. Let it cook for about 5 minutes and finally turn off the heat.
In the meantime, prepare the croutons to accompany the corn soup: cut 4 slices of durum wheat bread and place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, then drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil on each slice . Then salt to taste and sprinkle each slice with ground spicy paprika . Once the bread slices are seasoned, bake in a preheated static oven at 482°F for 5 minutes in grill mode, until they are slightly toasted and crispy . If using a convection oven, bake at 464°F for 2 and a half minutes in grill mode.
After this time, remove everything from the oven and let the bread slices cool on a wire rack, then place them on a cutting board and cut them in half lengthwise, forming sticks or cubes. Plate the corn soup and accompany it with the croutons . Sprinkle everything with a pinch of pepper and finish by drizzling a little oil : all that remains is to serve and enjoy the corn soup with the croutons hot!
You can store the corn soup for up to 2 days in the fridge in an airtight container or well covered with plastic wrap. Corn soup can be frozen.
Softness or crunchiness, that is the question. If you are looking for a method to make the soup even creamier, add a bit of cream or mascarpone during preparation; if instead you want to perfect it with some more solid bites, go for the cubes! Bacon is perfect, but also cutting the croutons and scattering them in the soup could be a good idea.
If you can't find pre-cooked corn cobs, don't worry and reach for that can of corn at the back of the pantry: it's time to use it!
