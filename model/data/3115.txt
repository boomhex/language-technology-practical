Bocconcini di tacchino e pancetta from Lombardy are those perfect turkey bacon bites that hit the spot. Really good stuff. When you need something tender, flavorful, and quick, these bites deliver. They get their zing from mustard and sage layered on the turkey before wrapping in thin slices of smoked pancetta . The sage? It pairs beautifully, creating a moist and savory center. Plus, the pancetta crisps up nicely, which gives that crispy finish everyone loves. In Lombardy, they're often served as an easy second course, but honestly, they make excellent turkey bacon appetizers for any event. You get those classic Italian vibes—simple, quick, and just bursting with flavor.
What sets these apart among other turkey bacon recipes is how the flavors blend. I mean, the mustard adds a tangy kick, making each bite exciting, and the sage keeps it aromatic. When these bites hit the pan, the butter turns everything golden, making the turkey and pancetta even better. It’s the kind of dish where you can bet the plate will be empty by the end of the night. For sure. In Lombardy, people love pairing them with a bright, fresh salad or some golden roasted potatoes, which makes the meal feel balanced. Really balanced.
These turkey and bacon snacks are perfect for a quick dinner or as a party plate of turkey bacon hors d’oeuvres or turkey bacon finger foods . No matter how you serve them, you enjoy that mix of tender turkey and crispy pancetta in every bite. Keeping things simple and delicious. Whether you're hosting or just want a quick meal, these bites are bound to impress with their straightforward yet rich flavors. And here's the thing, they’re pretty much irresistible.
To prepare the turkey and bacon bites, start by cutting the turkey breast into regular chunks about 0.39 inches thick . Prepare the other ingredients on a cutting board: the mustard, cleaned sage leaves, and bacon slices , then proceed to assemble the rolls. Spread a scant teaspoon of mustard on the upper surface of each turkey chunk and
place a small sage leaf on top . Wrap the turkey bite with a couple of slices of smoked bacon until it is completely covered (5-6).
Continue like this until all the turkey chunks are covered. Put the butter in a non-stick pan and let it melt along with a dash of oil, so the butter doesn't burn, add about ten sage leaves and let them brown for a couple of minutes on low heat so that they don't burn. At this point, add the turkey bites to the pan ,
let them brown for a couple of minutes and then deglaze with red wine . Finish cooking on high heat for about 10 minutes, remembering to turn the bites halfway through so that they are well browned on the other side . Taste and add salt only if necessary; your turkey and bacon bites are ready to be served!
The turkey and bacon bites can be stored in a tightly sealed container in the refrigerator for no more than two days. Warm them up for a few minutes in a pan by adding a dash of hot water to revive them. Freezing is not recommended.
Very tasty, these bites will be a huge success with the family (as they were with mine, extended to grandparents and uncles, so I can assure you they work!). Remember to salt only at the end of cooking, and lightly, because the combination of ingredients is already very flavorful! If there's any component you don't like, know that you can compose the dish according to your taste, substituting turkey with chicken breast, classic mustard with whole grain mustard (bolder, which will create a stronger contrast with the smoked bacon), or bacon itself with regular bacon (you'll only need one slice).
