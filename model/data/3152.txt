instructions:
To prepare the Nutella cream, pour the milk into a saucepan , turn on the heat and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, in another pot, work the egg yolks with the sugar until you get a clear, fluid, and homogeneous mixture.
Add a pinch of salt , also incorporating the sifted cornstarch , alternating it with about a glass of hot milk, taken from the one on the stove . Stir with a whisk to achieve a smooth and homogeneous consistency.
As soon as the milk reaches a near-boil, pour it all into the yolk mixture and transfer it back to the stove over moderate heat. Continue stirring until the cream has thickened .
Remove the pot from the heat and immediately incorporate the Nutella while the cream is still hot. Stir vigorously to make it fully absorbed . Pour the ready cream into a shallow, wide dish and cover with plastic wrap at contact. Let the cream cool completely at room temperature before using it: simply remove the plastic wrap and revitalize it by stirring vigorously with the whisk for a few minutes. The Nutella cream is ready for your preparations.
Nutella custard can be stored in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 5 days. It can also be frozen for about 1 month.
For a smoother cream on the palate, you can use half the amount of cornstarch and half rice starch.
You can prepare the cream the day before, storing it in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, until the next day. Before using it, revitalize it with the whisk.
With these quantities, you can fill a 9.5-10 inch cake with 2 layers of cream.
