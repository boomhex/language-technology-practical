If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for about 30 minutes to prevent burning while grilling.
In a bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon zest, minced garlic, minced ginger, dried oregano, salt, and pepper.
Add the shrimp to the bowl and toss to coat them evenly in the marinade.
Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 20-30 minutes.
In another bowl, mix all the ingredients for the yogurt sauce: Greek yogurt, sour cream, chopped dill, mint, lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Stir well and refrigerate until serving.
Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.
Assemble the skewers by alternating shrimp and zucchini pieces onto the skewers.
Grill the skewers for about 2-3 minutes per side or until the shrimp are cooked through and the zucchini is slightly charred.
Once the skewers are cooked, serve them hot with the yogurt sauce on the side for dipping.
Shrimp and zucchini skewers can stay in the fridge up to 48 hours.
Perfect for a party, the skewers and the sauce can be made in advance: just cook the skewers a few minutes before you are going to serve them.
