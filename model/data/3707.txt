instructions:
To prepare the berry milkshake, start by cleaning the fruit. First, gently separate the red currants , and place them in a colander along with the other berries: blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries. Then wash them well under running water . At this point, pour the ice into a blender .
Once this is done, also add the previously washed berries , the cold milk , and the sugar .
Turn on the blender and blend until the fruit and ice are completely blended, resulting in a smooth, creamy mixture . Pour the berry milkshake into glasses and garnish with a few mint leaves . Enjoy the berry milkshake well-chilled!
It is advisable to consume the berry milkshake immediately to prevent the fruit from oxidizing. Freezing is not recommended!
To make the berry milkshake creamier, you can add 1 or 2 scoops of berry ice cream. If it turns out too thick, add a bit more milk!
