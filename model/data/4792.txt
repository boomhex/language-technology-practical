We love meatballs in all forms, and even vegetable balls are very tasty. Today we propose to prepare some super crispy spinach meatballs! A perfect appetizer or main course that can be fried (or baked as suggested at the end of the recipe!), a treat that everyone at the table will agree on, vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike! To prepare them, it will be very simple, just 4 basic ingredients: fresh spinach wilted for a few minutes in a pan, grated cheese, an egg to bind the mixture, and breadcrumbs that will add a crunchy touch to the coating. Choose your favorite cheese to flavor them, the herbs you prefer, and unleash your creativity by maybe adding a gooey center!
