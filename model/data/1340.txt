instructions:
To prepare whole wheat shortcrust pastry, first, cut the cold butter into cubes. Place it into the bowl of a stand mixer equipped with a paddle attachment, add the sugar and salt . Mix the ingredients until you get a cream .
Then add the eggs , cinnamon , and mix until completely absorbed. Meanwhile, mix the whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour in a bowl .
Reduce the speed of the mixer and also add the flours . Let the powders absorb as well .
When you get a homogeneous mixture, transfer it to a surface and work it for a few moments, just the time to compact the pastry and get a dough . Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before using it to make tarts and cookies!
Whole wheat shortcrust pastry can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Alternatively, it can be frozen for up to 1 month.
Instead of cinnamon, you can flavor your whole wheat pastry with the zest of one lemon.
If you prefer a crumblier texture, you can add a pinch of baking powder, as in our recipe for Soft Shortcrust Pastry !
