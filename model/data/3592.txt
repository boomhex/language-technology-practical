instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Cut the carrots into very small pieces and place them in a non-stick pan with the oil ; slice the zucchini and the spring onion thinly ; cook the carrots for a few minutes over medium heat
then add the zucchini, spring onion, and zucchini flowers , cook for about 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are tender but not mushy. In a bowl, sift the flour with the baking powder and grate the cheese , mix well; add the corn and stir it in so it gets lightly coated with flour;
also chop the chives and add them to the bowl ; pour in the cooked vegetables and mix everything together again;
Pour the oil into the mixture and in another bowl pour the milk, cream, and two eggs and lightly beat them,
pour this mixture into the one with the flour , adjust the salt and pepper and mix everything with a spoon. Prepare the plumcake mold with a capacity of 1 quart by lining it with parchment paper that you have dampened under running water and then wrung out (this helps it adhere better to the mold) use it now while still damp to cover the mold making it stick well to the sides;
Now pour the plumcake mixture and then brush the surface with milk; sprinkle with poppy seeds , pine nuts, and sesame seeds (20-21). Bake in the hot oven for 35 minutes; check the cooking with a toothpick. Then let it cool for about ten minutes in the mold and then turn it out onto a rack or tray so that it cools completely.
This savory plumcake can also be prepared using Gruyere instead of Edam or Fontina, all cheeses that are not too aged but give a strong flavor to the plumcake itself. It is best consumed within three days by storing it in a paper bread bag so that it does not dry out or become soggy if stored in a plastic fridge bag. It would be advisable to wait a few hours before slicing it so the internal moisture has time to escape and the slices remain firm.
