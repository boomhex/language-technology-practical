instructions:
To prepare the rice timbale with eggplants and tomatoes, first wash the eggplant and slice them into pieces about 1/8-1/4 inch thick . Grill the eggplants on a hot grill and set them aside .
Finely chop the shallot . Pour the oil and shallot into a wide pan and stew on low heat for about 5-6 minutes .
Pour in the rice and toast it for a few minutes. Add the tomato sauce and mix . Start cooking the rice with hot vegetable broth, adding 1-2 ladles as needed .
Add salt, sprinkle the thyme leaves, and cook the rice . At the end of cooking, remove from heat and stir with Parmesan and oil. Now take a tapered mold with a base diameter of 9.5 inches, 8 inches at the top, and a height of 2 inches. Oil the mold and arrange the grilled eggplants in a radial pattern .
You need to cover all empty spaces . Pour the rice in the center and distribute it evenly. Cut the fresh cheese into cubes .
Stuff with the cheese cubes ; then place more slices of eggplant to cover the entire filling , fold the eggplants to completely wrap the rice and form a cake , pressing with your hands or a plate.
Oil and salt the eggplants . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 15 minutes. Let it cool at room temperature. In the meantime, prepare the cherry tomatoes. First, wash them and cut them into quarters .
In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil with garlic and thyme . Pour in the tomatoes , salt, and cook for about 8-10 minutes on medium heat .
Once the timbale is cold, turn it upside down on a serving plate and remove the mold . Once cut into slices, serve it with the cherry tomatoes .
It can be stored for 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Choose large eggplants that can wrap the rice better.
