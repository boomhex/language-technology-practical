So, let's dive into pain perdu , shall we? This French toast recipe is a staple in French kitchens, and for real, it's something special. You start with day-old pan brioche. Why? Well, it’s sweet and already soft—making it perfect. And listen, after soaking in eggs with vanilla and cinnamon, the bread is fried up in butter until it gets that golden, crispy crust. Inside, though, it's tender—like, super comforting.
Many say pain perdu is the classic French toast , the OG version. And in France, you see it at breakfast, snack time, even fancy brunches. Always brings that sweet, cozy vibe. Want to make it even better? Top it with a berry sauce. A bit tangy, you know, balancing out the rich bread. That fruity touch? Really, really elevates it. Not just another easy French toast .
Globally, you’ll find variations, but with brioche and berries? It's got that French flair. Pain perdu's about not wasting stale bread, turning it into a treat. Some call it New Orleans French toast when adding a twist, but the heart stays the same: a moist, custardy middle with a crispy edge and a hint of spice.
If you’re scouting for brunch ideas or curious about a true pain perdu recipe , this dish is the one. You’ll want to make it again and again—no question. Plus, if you're exploring French breakfast classics, croissants or pain au chocolat are great, but, honestly, nothing hits the sweet spot like pain perdu. Which is great. Really.

To prepare the pain perdu, first crack the eggs into a bowl, then add the soy milk , the sugar , and the cinnamon .
Also add the vanilla extract and mix with a whisk to combine the ingredients. Cut the brioche bread into fairly thick slices, about 1-1.2 inches . You should get 10 slices.
In a non-stick pan, melt the butter , then dip the slices of brioche bread into the milk and egg mixture and transfer them to the hot pan .
Cook over medium heat for 1-2 minutes per side , until golden brown and set aside. While you cook all the slices of brioche bread, focus on the sauce: in a pan, place the berries .
Add the sugar , the lemon juice , and cook over medium heat for 5-7 minutes .
For serving, pour the berry sauce into a small bowl, place it in the center of the serving plate, then arrange the slices of brioche bread in a circular pattern. Complete with maple syrup and powdered sugar . Your pain perdu is ready to be served .
The pain perdu should be enjoyed as soon as it's prepared, but if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator in a closed container for up to 1 day. When serving, we recommend warming it slightly in a pan or in the oven at a low temperature.
Instead of using brioche bread, you can use stale bread, as tradition dictates. Instead of berries, you can use strawberries, peaches, or caramelized apples. To make it even more delicious, you can accompany it with custard, chocolate ganache, or a simple crème anglaise.
