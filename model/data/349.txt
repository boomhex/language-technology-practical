instructions:
To prepare sarmale, first peel and finely chop the onions , then combine ground beef, veal, and pork in a bowl . Finely chop parsley and dill .
In a pan, sauté the onion with seed oil for a few minutes , then add the rice and cook for about 2 minutes. Now add the ground meat mix , mix well, and cook for 20 minutes.
At the end of cooking, season with chopped parsley and dill . Transfer everything to a bowl and let cool completely to room temperature. Meanwhile, remove the larger leaves from the cabbage, being careful not to break them, and set them aside . Remove the central core .
Julienne the rest of the cabbage . Blanch the intact cabbage leaves in salted boiling water for 5-8 minutes, then drain and immerse them in cold water . Meanwhile, cut the smoked bacon into strips about 1/2 inch thick .
Drain the cabbage leaves well, remove the central rib , and divide them into 3 parts . Place a teaspoon of filling in the center .
Fold one side inward , then the bottom part , and then the other side .
Roll to close the rolls , then lay them with the seam side down on the bottom of a non-stick pot where you have spread the julienned cabbage . Form a first layer of rolls .
Add the smoked bacon strips and cover with a second layer of rolls. At this point, pour the tomato puree and the water ; make sure the liquid completely covers the rolls.
Cover with the lid and cook on low heat for about 3 hours. When cooking is complete , gently plate the rolls and finish with sour cream. Your sarmale are ready to be served !
Sarmale can be stored in the refrigerator, in a sealed container, for 2-3 days.
As with any traditional recipe, every family has its version: for example, you can make a sauté of onions and carrots and replace the tomato puree with tomato paste.
Try to fill the pot to the brim so that the lid helps press the rolls down during cooking; this way, they won’t open.
