To prepare the mussels with orange and ginger, start by cleaning the mussels: place the mussels in a bowl and rinse them under fresh running water . Using a knife, remove any impurities from the mussel shell , then pull off the beard (or byssus) with your hands , and scrub the mussels one by one vigorously under running water with a stiff brush and set them aside.
Carefully peel the orange using a vegetable peeler , and take only the zest, which you will then cut into julienne strips . Cut the orange in half and squeeze it, keeping the juice aside .
Now place the mussels in a non-stick pan and let them open over high heat , covered with a lid . When the mussels start to open, drizzle them with the white wine
and the orange juice , and continue cooking, still over high heat, until all the shells of the shellfish have opened. Once the mussels are ready, set them aside and keep them warm, then peel the ginger and strain the cooking liquid , which you will return to the heat
adding the grated ginger , the orange zest , the chopped parsley, and, if desired, some black pepper for seasoning . Cook everything for a few minutes over low heat until the mixture thickens.
Now remove the half shell from the mussels without the mollusk attached and place them on a serving dish, then sprinkle them with the prepared sauce and serve immediately. The mussels with orange and ginger are ready .
It is preferable to consume the mussels with orange and ginger as soon as they are ready, but if you wish, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one day. It is advisable not to freeze the mussels with orange and ginger.
If you like, you can make the same recipe by replacing the orange with lemon.
