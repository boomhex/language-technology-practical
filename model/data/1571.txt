instructions:
To make the leeks with ham, first trim the leek, then cut it lengthwise to remove the outer leaves . Cut them into 3 equal parts , wrap a slice of ham around each piece , and set aside.
Meanwhile, prepare the Parmesan cream: in a saucepan, place the butter and melt it over low heat , then add the sifted flour all at once and stir vigorously with a whisk .
Then pour the heavy cream at room temperature in several additions , salt , and pepper .
and add 25 g (0.88 oz) of grated Parmesan , setting aside the remaining 5 g (0.18 oz) for garnish at the end. Stir well, keeping the heat on medium until the cream has thickened: this will take about 4 minutes in total . Pour the cream onto the bottom of a baking dish that fits the leeks : we used a square pan measuring 8x8 inches.
Then place the leeks , garnish with the remaining grated Parmesan set aside , and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 18 minutes, switching to grill mode at 464°F for the last 2 minutes. Once a crust has formed, the leeks with ham will be ready to be served .
The leeks with ham can be stored in the refrigerator for one day, covered with plastic wrap. We do not recommend freezing.
Try adding aromatic herbs like fresh oregano or thyme to give a touch of fragrance and color to the dish. For a more indulgent result, add more Parmesan cream on top of the leeks, so as to envelop them completely. If your leeks are quite large or if you prefer them less crunchy, peel them a lot to obtain only the inner soft core.
