instructions:
To prepare baked eggplants with potatoes, first boil the potatoes for about 20 minutes : they should remain quite firm. In the meantime, trim the eggplant and cut it into slices about 1/4 inch thick .
Once the potatoes are cooked, peel them and also cut them into slices about 1/4 inch thick . At this point, grease a baking dish and arrange a first layer of eggplants, slightly overlapping the slices. Continue with a layer of potatoes, partially overlapping the eggplants, and keep alternating the two ingredients until they are used up .
Drizzle with a little oil , salt , pepper, and a few thyme leaves , then bake in a preheated convection oven at 356°F for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, slice the scamorza cheese . After 20 minutes of baking, remove from the oven and add the scamorza slices on top , then put back in the oven for about 5 minutes, until the cheese melts. Your baked eggplants with potatoes are ready to be served !
Baked eggplants with potatoes can be stored in the refrigerator for one day. Freezing is not recommended.
You can replace the mild scamorza with smoked scamorza, or you can choose another type of cheese like bitto, casera, or mozzarella.
