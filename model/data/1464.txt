To make the water muffins, first pour the brown sugar and water into a bowl, mix with a whisk to combine , and then gradually add the vegetable oil , still mixing.
Now incorporate the dry ingredients by sifting them through a sieve: add the flour , the baking powder , and the baking soda .
Mix the batter with the whisk until smooth and homogeneous, without lumps. Add the chopped chocolate , flax seeds
And finally the chia seeds . Stir one last time to evenly distribute the seeds, then pour the batter into muffin cups with a diameter of 2.36 inches and about 1.97 inches high, using a ladle . Decorate the surface with more seeds
and when you have filled all the muffin cups , bake them in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 20 minutes and then continue for another 20 minutes in convection mode. Once cooked, remove your water muffins from the oven, let them cool slightly, and then serve them .
Water muffins can be stored at room temperature for one day covered with a glass dome. It is possible to freeze them after baking.
