To prepare the wild red rice with artichokes and stracchino, start by placing a pot on the stove for the Vegetable broth . Meanwhile, peel the shallot and slice it thinly . Then proceed with the How to clean artichokes : remove the toughest leaves . When you reach the more tender part, make a clean cut on the surface .
Then divide them in two; if you find the choke in the center, remove it, and finally cut into thin strips . Sauté the shallot in a pan with a drizzle of oil for a few minutes and add the artichokes ,
a ladle of hot broth and let it cook for 5 minutes on low heat . Now it's time for the red rice. Dip it in the pan, stir for a few moments , and continue cooking, moistening as needed with the hot broth .
