To prepare mussels in saffron sauce, start by cleaning the mussels: place the mussels in a bowl and rinse them under cold running water . Using a knife, remove impurities from the mussel shell , then remove the beard (or byssus) by pulling it off with your hands . Then, with a stiff brush, scrub the mussels quickly and vigorously under running water and set them aside.
In a non-stick pan, sauté the finely chopped onion with a little oil , add two bay leaves and the chopped parsley, keeping some aside for the final garnish .
As soon as the onion has softened, add the mussels and let them open over high heat, deglaze with the white wine . Once all the mussels have opened, remove them from the pan, discard the shell part that does not contain the shellfish, and keep them aside, warm.
Now reduce the cooking liquid by adding a sachet of saffron previously dissolved in a little mussel liquid , until you obtain a thick sauce, then remove the bay leaves . Place the mussels on a serving dish and sprinkle them with the sauce, finally garnish with finely chopped parsley. The mussels in saffron sauce are ready, serve them immediately.
It is preferable to consume the mussels in saffron sauce as soon as they are ready, but if you wish, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one day. It is recommended not to freeze the mussels in saffron sauce.
If you like, you can use a clove of garlic instead of the onion.
