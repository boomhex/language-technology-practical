To make the savory rice puddings, start by preparing the pastry. Follow our recipe Easy Shortcrust Pastry : place the flour, cold chopped butter , and a pinch of salt in a food processor and blend until you get a sandy and floury mixture. Place the obtained mixture on a work surface in the classic fountain shape and knead quickly, gradually adding cold water until you get a compact and fairly elastic dough. Once ready, wrap your pastry in a sheet of plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 40 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the risotto. In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil and add finely chopped shallots ; let the shallots soften and then add the rice , allowing it to toast for a few minutes. Deglaze with white wine
and then add a ladle of vegetable broth (for the best result, follow our guide Vegetable broth ), stir and separately dilute a tablespoon of triple tomato concentrate in 50 ml of broth and pour it into the rice . Cook the rice, gradually adding vegetable broth and stirring occasionally.
Halfway through cooking, add the peas . Continue cooking by incorporating the broth little by little until the rice is ready; it should be very al dente because it will continue cooking in the oven. When the rice is ready, cream with taleggio cheese and also add the diced cooked ham .
Let the risotto cool and roll out the pastry to about 1/8 inch , cut out circles using a pastry cutter with a diameter of about 4.75 inches
and line a greased muffin tin with these casings . Fill the pastry with the risotto and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 60 minutes. Once done, take the puddings out of the oven and let them cool slightly, then remove them by turning the mold onto a tray or removing them one by one from the mold. Your savory rice puddings are ready to be enjoyed .
Store the rice puddings in the refrigerator for a couple of days at most. It's possible to freeze the puddings if you've used fresh ingredients.
You can vary the risotto ingredients according to your taste or the season's availability: potatoes, asparagus, zucchini, fava beans, or beans are just a few of the countless variations you can try. To cream the risotto, you can replace taleggio with a milder cheese like brie. Alternatively, you can use mortadella or smoked bacon instead of cooked ham.
