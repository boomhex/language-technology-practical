instructions:
To prepare the barley and salmon salad, first rinse the barley under running water , then cook it in boiling water for 20 minutes or as indicated on the package. While the barley is cooking, prepare the accompanying sauce: place the yogurt in a bowl, season with the grated zest of an orange
and add the juice as well , salt , and pepper. Remove the fronds from the fennel
and chop them finely , then slice the fennel and set aside. Flavor the yogurt sauce with the fennel fronds
and olive oil , mix and set aside. Meanwhile, the barley will have finished cooking, drain it and let it cool in a bowl . Once the barley is cool, add the washed and dried baby spinach and the sliced fennel .
Now prepare the salmon: remove the bones with tweezers , then heat the olive oil in a pan , place the salmon fillets, salt, pepper , and cook them for 2 minutes on one side and 1 minute on the other.
Once cooked , transfer the salmon to a plate and cut it into small pieces . Add the salmon pieces to the barley salad .
Now handle the avocado: cut it in half (19-20), remove the pit, and score the flesh by making horizontal and vertical cuts :
this way you'll obtain squares to add to the preparation . One last touch of flavor is missing: the orange sauce prepared earlier . The barley and salmon salad is ready to be enjoyed .
The barley and salmon salad keeps for a maximum of one day in the refrigerator. Freezing is not recommended.
