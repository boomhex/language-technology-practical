instructions:
To prepare the fried lamb chops, start by cutting 8 chops from the rack using a knife and set them aside. Now focus on the breading: in a shallow and wide bowl that can hold the chops, place the whole eggs, beat them with a fork , and season with grated Parmesan cheese
salt and pepper , and mix again for a homogeneous mixture. In another bowl, pour the breadcrumbs. Take one chop at a time, dip it in the beaten egg leaving the bone uncovered ;
roll it in the breadcrumbs , again in the egg , and finally coat it thoroughly in the breadcrumbs again ,
to achieve a double breading that will make the fried lamb chops even crunchier. Now you can proceed with the cooking: pour the olive oil into a high-sided pan, heat the oil, and with a thermometer ensure the temperature reaches and does not exceed 340°F (170°C) for a perfect and dry frying. Fry the chops for about 4-5 minutes, immersing them while holding the bone with your hands or kitchen tongs. It's recommended not to cook more than one or two at a time, so as not to lower the oil temperature (11-12). The cooking time may vary based on the size of the chops.
Once cooked , transfer them to a tray lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil . Serve the fried lamb chops while still hot to enjoy them nice and crunchy !
It's best to consume the lamb chops immediately; if any are left over, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. Freezing after cooking is not recommended.
Want to flavor the breading? Just add a chopped blend of parsley, rosemary, or thyme, the choice is yours!
