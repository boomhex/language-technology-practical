instructions:
To make the deconstructed cheesecake, first place the cookies in a food bag and crush them with a rolling pin or wooden spoon . They should be roughly crumbled .
Set the cookies aside and prepare the cream: in a small bowl, pour in the well-drained ricotta , yogurt , and sugar .
Flavor with the lemon zest and mix with a fork to combine the ingredients . Store the cream in the fridge and take the cherries: wash, dry, and pit them with the appropriate tool .
Pour the cherries into a saucepan , add the sugar and the lemon juice filtered through a sieve to hold back the seeds .
Cook the mixture for 10 minutes on medium heat , stirring occasionally. Once the cooking is finished, turn off the heat and compose the dessert. Place the cookies on a single-serving plate ;
cover them with the yogurt cream and finally flavor with the cooked cherries . Your deconstructed cheesecake is ready to be served .
The deconstructed cheesecake can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 days. We do not recommend freezing it.
For those with a sweet tooth, chocolate cookies can be used as a substitute.
