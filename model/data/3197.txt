To prepare lorighittas with eggplants and mushrooms, first cut all the vegetables. Wash, dry, and dice the eggplant ; clean the mushrooms and slice them ; remove the outer leaves of the leek and cut it into rings .
Sauté the eggplant cubes in a non-stick pan with a drizzle of olive oil , stirring with a wooden spoon until they are well browned . Season with salt and pepper.
Sauté the champignon mushrooms now, placing them in a pan with oil and two whole garlic cloves (so you can remove them at the end of cooking). Cook over low heat until they are tender, and season with salt and chopped parsley (8-9).
At this point, stew the leek in a pan with a drizzle of oil and half a cup of water for 10-12 minutes. When cooked, transfer the leek to a blender and blend until creamy .
In the meantime, cook the lorighittas in plenty of salted boiling water for the time indicated on the package. In a large pan, combine the other ingredients: the leek cream, the eggplants, and the sautéed mushrooms (14-15).
Drain the lorighittas, setting aside a ladle of cooking water to better mix everything, and add them directly to the pot with the other preparations . Toss the pasta to mix all the ingredients well and finish with a sprinkle of chopped parsley and pepper (17-18). The lorighittas with eggplants and mushrooms are ready!
You can store the lorighittas with eggplants and mushrooms in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for a couple of days. Freezing is not recommended.
And if all this still isn't enough, why not add some tomato sauce?
