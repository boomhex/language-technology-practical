instructions:
To prepare the baked saffron rice with speck and brie, first bring a pot of water to a boil that you will use to cook the risotto. Heat the oil in a pan , then add the rice and toast it for a few minutes, stirring frequently, until it feels hot to the touch .
Salt and cook the rice by adding a ladle of hot water at a time . Always make sure that the liquid is absorbed before adding the next ladle .
Meanwhile, cut the taleggio first into slices and then into cubes . Cut the speck into strips .
After 10 minutes, add the saffron and mix well, then finish cooking the rice. When the risotto is ready, turn off the heat and stir in cold cubed butter and grated Parmigiano Reggiano PDO .
Let it rest for a minute before mixing everything well . If it turns out too dry, you can add a little more water. At this point, add the taleggio and speck .
Mix well , then transfer the risotto to a 9.5x9.5 inch baking dish and level the surface .
Dust the surface with plenty of grated cheese and cook in a preheated static oven at 450°F for about 20 minutes. When the crust becomes crunchy and golden, remove from the oven and let the casserole rest for a few minutes. Your baked saffron rice with speck and brie is ready to be served !
The baked saffron rice with speck and brie can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days, in an airtight container.
If you don't like taleggio, you can replace it with diced scamorza or provola!
Instead of speck, you can use pancetta.
