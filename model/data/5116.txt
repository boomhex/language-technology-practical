and the chopped rosemary and let them sauté for a few minutes, being careful not to burn them. Now add the diced potatoes and cook them, stirring often
and adding a ladle of boiling water at a time as needed ; it will take about 20 minutes. When the potatoes are almost cooked, adjust the salt and pepper. In the meantime, the water for cooking the pasta will have come to a boil, so cook it , then drain it al dente directly into the pan with the potatoes ,
mix well and finish cooking by adding some of the pasta cooking water as needed: by combining pasta and potatoes in the same pan, a delicious cream will form thanks to the starch released by the pasta and potatoes. Finally, season with some thyme leaves and pepper to taste, turn off the heat, and drizzle with a bit of raw extra virgin olive oil . Your pasta and potatoes are ready to be enjoyed while still hot !

Depending on your taste, you can choose to make the pasta and potatoes dry or rather brothy by adding more or less cooking water during preparation.

As is well known, potatoes were unknown in Europe until the discovery of the Americas. What perhaps not everyone knows is that even after being imported to the Old World, potatoes did not immediately become part of the European diet because they were considered even poisonous. It was Louis XVI, king of France from 1774 to 1792, who legitimized the use of this tuber thanks to an ingenious stratagem: he ordered his guards to guard a mysterious cultivated field, thus arousing the curiosity of the peasants; convinced that a refined ingredient destined for the court was there, they broke into the field at night and found... a handful of potatoes! Since then, the potato has become a staple of our diet due to its high carbohydrate content.
