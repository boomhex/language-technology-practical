And here's the thing, Chef Michelangelo Mammoliti has done something way cool by letting earthy celeriac (yeah, that’s celery root) soak up these rich, savory notes.

Really, it’s more than just another root vegetable recipe . It’s layers and layers of moist, fragrant flavors. Makes you rethink what a simple celeriac dish can be.
And listen, the thoughtful details here are pretty much what set this celeriac recipe apart. There's a crunch from toasted hazelnuts—Piedmont’s famous nuts, for sure—and a hint of coffee that adds a nutty, deep edge. These flavors work beautifully with the soft celeriac and the subtle tang of the sauce. And the golden color of the finished dish? Seriously good.

To prepare the celeriac with bagna cauda infusion, first wash and peel the celeriac, then remove imperfections with a paring knife. Cut the celeriac into slices 0.8-1 inch thick : you will need 4 uniform slices each weighing about 7 oz . Use a round cutter to shape the slices into a regular form .
Prepare the other ingredients as well: cut the unpeeled garlic cloves in half lengthwise , then wash and dry the ginger and cut 4 slices . Now place 2 sheets of aluminum foil side by side and attach them by overlapping and folding one of the edges .
Place the celeriac discs on one of the aluminum sheets and generously season with oil , salt , and pepper .
Add the ground coffee , half a clove of unpeeled garlic , and a slice of ginger .
Finally, add aroma with a sprig of rosemary . Cover with the other sheet of aluminum foil and seal all sides well, then transfer the parcel to a baking sheet . Bake in a fan oven preheated to 356°F for 15-20 minutes: note that once the parcel puffs up, it will take about ten minutes. Once cooked, remove the parcel from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the bagna cauda: cut the garlic in half and remove the core, then place it in a saucepan along with the anchovies and the oil . Turn on the heat and simmer gently.
When the anchovies are not yet completely dissolved, pour in the milk at room temperature and bring to a boil. From that moment, let it simmer for 7-8 minutes, stirring occasionally , then blend with an immersion blender .
Finally, strain the mixture through a sieve and pour it back into the saucepan to keep it warm. Place the hazelnuts in a pan, turn on the heat, and toast them for 4-5 minutes . Coarsely crush the hazelnuts with a pestle or a meat tenderizer, adding a pinch of salt .
After the resting time, open the parcel, being careful not to burn yourself with the steam, remove the seasonings , and check the cooking with a toothpick: the texture should be tender. Cut the celeriac slices into 4 parts and garnish with the crushed hazelnuts .
Flavor with fresh herbs and complete the dish with the bagna cauda infusion . Your celeriac with bagna cauda infusion is ready to be served !
