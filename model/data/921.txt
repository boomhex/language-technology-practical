instructions:
To prepare the gluten-free pancakes, first, beat the egg with the sugar in a bowl using a whisk, then gradually pour in the milk while continuing to mix . Add the flour and stir to eliminate all lumps , then add the baking powder .
Mix again until you obtain a smooth, homogeneous batter . Grease a non-stick pan with a little oil and remove the excess with a paper towel , then pour a ladle of batter and cook over low heat.
When bubbles start to form on the surface , flip the pancake with a spatula and continue to cook until it turns golden on the other side; it will take about 1-2 minutes per side . Continue in this way to cook all the pancakes, stacking them as they are ready. Your gluten-free pancakes are ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the gluten-free pancakes immediately or store them in the refrigerator for up to one day. Freezing is not recommended.
The batter can be stored in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for up to 12 hours.
For a lactose-free version, you can substitute cow's milk with rice milk or another type of plant-based milk!
