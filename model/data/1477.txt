To prepare the rustic lemon cookies, pour the all-purpose flour , cornmeal flour , and baking powder into a bowl.
Mix everything and pour both the egg and the yolk into the center.
Add a pinch of salt , the pieces of soft butter , and the sugar .
Add the grated lemon zest and the lemon juice . Knead with your hands .
The dough will be slightly hard, also add the water to soften it. Knead again , then form a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap . Let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Then roll out the dough to a thickness of a quarter inch . Using fluted cutters of 2.5 inches, cut out the cookies , and using the tip of a piping bag or a round cutter about 1 inch, create a hole in the center of each cookie .
Gradually transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and knead the scraps again to form more cookies. If the dough becomes too warm, you can transfer it to the refrigerator for a few minutes. Bake the cookies in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 15 minutes. Then take the cookies out and let them cool at room temperature before dusting them with powdered sugar and serving them .
The rustic lemon cookies can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week.
