So, here's the deal with this caffellatte ghiacciato . It's basically Italy’s way of making summer super fun and refreshing. I mean, instead of just the usual hot coffee, Italians, you know, really mix it up when it's hot outside. You get this strong arabica coffee blended with chilled milk and a scoop of gelato. Yep, all whirled together with ice. Seriously good, right? The result is this creamy, super cold caffè freddo cremoso that’s like a frozen coffee milkshake but still has that classic Italian vibe. Perfect for when you need a break from the heat. Which is great. And listen, pairing it with homemade cookies shaped like coffee beans makes it feel special and, frankly, fun.
No matter where you are in Italy, you’ll find someone enjoying a ricetta caffellatte veloce like this on a lazy afternoon or, you know, during a chat with friends. It’s all about making the usual coffee break smooth, sweet, and a bit different. Really, the high-quality coffee ensures you still taste those deep, slightly bitter notes, while the gelato adds the perfect creamy sweetness. Sometimes, folks switch out the gelato for fancier flavors or try almond milk. Keeps it interesting.
What’s cool is that this kind of caffè freddo fatto in casa is pretty simple to whip up, so you can surprise friends when they come over or just treat yourself after a busy day. And you know what? Pairing the drink with coffee-flavored cookies is a classic move. That whole crispy and cool combo is hard to resist. Next time you want a beverage al caffè estiva that’s way, way fancier than your usual iced coffee, this Italian favorite has your back. It’s all about embracing those little joys and adding a touch of Italian flair to your summer coffee routine. Can't go wrong.
For this recipe, start with the coffee bean cookies that will accompany the iced latte: in a stand mixer (or a large bowl), place the butter in pieces, add the sugar , and start whipping until you get a fluffy mixture. Then add the liquid coffee and the coffee powder and mix well with the beaters.
In a separate small bowl, add the sifted cocoa powder and flour . Mix and pour the mixture along with the other ingredients into the stand mixer (or a large bowl using an electric beater) , mix again with the beaters and then continue kneading with the paddle attachment. (If you don't have a paddle attachment, you can finish kneading directly with your hands on the work surface). Transfer the dough to the work surface, and knead with your hands to obtain a homogeneous and pliable dough .
Form a dough ball and cover it with plastic wrap . Place it in the refrigerator to rest for at least two hours. After the necessary time, cut the dough ball into small logs and cut them into pieces of 0.5 oz each .
Work each piece of dough with your hands to give it the oval and elongated shape of coffee beans . With these quantities, you can make 30 coffee bean cookies. Use a small knife to create a "S" incision on each one . Then place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and, before baking, put them in the fridge for another 30 minutes so the dough firms up and holds during baking. After half an hour, take them out of the fridge and bake them in a preheated static oven at 340°F for at least 20 minutes (if using a convection oven, 300°F for 15 minutes). When they are cooked, take them out and let them cool .
While the coffee bean cookies are cooling, you can focus on the iced latte. Start by preparing the coffee with the moka pot: put cold water, preferably low in calcium, in the boiler up to the safety valve (otherwise you will get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee and level it with each added teaspoon by tapping the filter on the table with decisive movements , until reaching the edge of the filter.
Do not press with the teaspoon, nor make holes, and screw the coffee maker tightly (to avoid coffee escaping from the sides while rising), then place it on a low and constant flame, to get a rich coffee. As the coffee rises, a dense foam will form ; we recommend not letting the coffee sputter for too long, to maintain its aroma and sweetness. Then turn off the heat and your coffee for use in the preparation is ready: mix it directly in the moka pot with a teaspoon, to make it more homogeneous .
For each glass, in a container pour 1.7 oz of coffee , add 2 teaspoons of sugar , and mix. In a blender add 6-7 ice cubes, 5 oz of ice cream (3 scoops), 1.7 oz of milk, and the sweetened coffee .
Blend all the ingredients until you get a smooth cream. Before transferring the cream to the glass, prepare the whipped cream. You can consult this procedure by consulting the cooking school card: How to Whip Cream . Then pour the well-chilled fresh liquid cream into a large bowl and with cold beaters of an electric mixer, whip the cream to stiff peaks . At this point, add the sifted powdered sugar and incorporate it into the cream with a spatula mixing from the bottom up to avoid deflating.
At this point, you can assemble your iced latte: take the iced coffee cream and pour it into a medium tumbler glass (or a tall glass) up to 1.5-2 inches from the top . Then add enough whipped cream to garnish the surface and sprinkle as desired with cocoa powder and brown sugar mixed together . Repeat the same procedure to prepare the other glasses. Meanwhile, the coffee bean cookies will have cooled and will be excellent to serve as an accompaniment to this tasty iced latte .
It is recommended to consume the iced latte as soon as it is made. The coffee bean cookies can be stored for 1 week at room temperature in a closed airtight container.
