instructions:
To prepare the apricot crumble cake, start with the apricots, cutting them into not too small cubes . Extract the seeds from a vanilla pod and set them aside. Take a large bowl and grate the lemon zest into it .
Add the all-purpose flour, corn flour , vanilla seeds from the pod , and coarsely chopped raw almonds .
Also add the sugar and mix the dry ingredients with a whisk . Now add the apricots .
Also add the butter cubes , lard , and egg yolks .
Finally, add the salt and start kneading first with a spatula and then with your hands . The mixture should not be perfectly smooth, but the ingredients should be well blended. Transfer the mixture into a previously greased and floured 9.5-inch mold .
Spread the crumbs well, without pressing them down . Bake in a preheated static oven at 338°F for 35-40 minutes . Once it is golden brown, remove it from the oven and sprinkle with a little granulated sugar . Let it cool, remove from the mold, and serve .
The apricot crumble cake can be stored at room temperature for 2-3 days.
You can also flavor the dough with a pinch of cinnamon! If you prefer to replace the lard, you can use the same amount of butter. For an extra touch, you can flavor the sugar used to sprinkle on the crumble cake with some lemon zest.
