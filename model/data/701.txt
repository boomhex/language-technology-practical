It is recommended to consume the nachos with meat immediately, otherwise the chips will absorb the moisture from the toppings and become soft.
The meat and bean topping can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days in an airtight container, or it can be frozen.
For a crunchy result, it is important that the meat and bean mixture is not too watery, so make sure the liquid in the pan has evaporated.
If you want, you can further enrich the recipe by adding guacamole or pickled gherkins.
You can use packaged chips or make them yourself starting from the dough of corn tortillas: follow our nachos recipe!
