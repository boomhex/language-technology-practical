instructions:
To make the risotto with bacon, peas, and marjoram, slice the smoked bacon , then cut it into strips , and brown the bacon in a pan without adding any additional fats
when it is crispy, transfer it to a bowl . Peel and chop the shallot , heat the olive oil in the same pan used for the bacon, and then add the chopped shallot
let it wilt over low heat for at least 5 minutes. In the meantime, blanch the peas in boiling water for 3-4 minutes then drain them . When the shallot is soft, add the rice and toast it, stirring with a wooden spoon.
Deglaze with white wine , add a couple of ladles of hot vegetable broth , and let it cook by adding the broth as needed, one ladle at a time, for 10 minutes. It is important not to add too much broth at once; it should be added as the rice absorbs it. Meanwhile, wash, dry, and chop the marjoram .
When there are a few minutes left to the end of cooking, add the peas and the bacon , season with marjoram , and adjust the salt and pepper.
Turn off the heat and stir the risotto with butter and grated cheese . Your risotto with bacon, peas, and marjoram is ready to be enjoyed hot .
It is recommended to enjoy the risotto with bacon, peas, and marjoram while it's hot. You can store it for up to 1 day in the refrigerator in an airtight container and reheat it with some hot broth. Freezing is not recommended.
For an even creamier risotto, instead of stirring with butter, use crescenza or another soft fresh cheese of your choice.
