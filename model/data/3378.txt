instructions:
To prepare the scallops with wine, start by washing and drying the mushrooms very well. Chop them finely and brown them in a pan where you have melted the butter, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and crushed garlic (2-3).
Deglaze with white wine , add a sprinkle of parsley , and add the cream , let it cook until it reaches a creamy consistency.
The filling of the scallops with wine should not be too dry . Adjust with salt and pepper, if necessary. Now take a baking sheet and cover it with parchment paper. With strips of aluminum foil, form circles (8-9) that, placed at the base of each shell, will serve as support for the scallops with wine.
Place the scallops on their supports, salt, and pepper them lightly to flavor them , proceed by putting the previously prepared filling on the scallops , and bake at 392°F for 20 minutes in a static oven. For the last 5 minutes, turn on the grill to get a nice gratin. The scallop tapa with wine is ready to be enjoyed!
Consume the scallop tapa with wine as soon as it is made.
