Cocoa and almond diamonds. They’re the kind of treat that makes any day feel a little more special. Really. These classic cocoa almond cookies come straight out of Italian pastry traditions—where folks know how to turn simple ingredients into something tender and just a tad crispy around the edges. Each bite? A nice mix of chocolate almond cookies flavor with a touch of cinnamon and sugar. So... So cozy.
Using almond flour in the dough does wonders. It not only brings out a deep nutty taste but also creates that friable texture Italians just love in their best cookies. Across Italy, bakers use this dough technique to get that contrast between a soft bite and a golden finish. And look, these little cookies are perfect with morning coffee or afternoon tea—shared with friends and family around the table. Which is great.
What sets these almond cocoa bars apart from other almond flour cookies? It's the attention to detail. The dough is shaped into diamonds—a style you’ll see in pastry shops all over Italy. Sometimes in different flavors or with powdered sugar dusting instead of cinnamon. Really, what makes these special is how the homemade chocolate almond cookies keep that gentle almond taste while still giving you a moist, chocolatey finish. It’s easy to see why people love this kind of easy almond cookie recipe . It’s just the right mix of simple and fancy, without being too heavy or too sweet.
Plus, the way the cinnamon sugar on top melts into the surface? Seriously good. It makes each bite a bit sweet and a bit crunchy. Whether you’re after gluten-free almond cookies or just a fresh idea for cocoa powder desserts, these cookies bring out that Italian knack for making food that’s all about sharing, comfort, and those little moments of indulgence. So, next time you want something special but not too fussy, these almond chocolate treats are perfect. They offer a taste of Italy’s love for simple yet flavorful creations. Pretty much.
To prepare the cocoa and almond diamonds, start by adding the cold butter cut into pieces and 1 ¾ cups of all-purpose flour into a mixer . Blend until you get a sandy dough and set it aside in a large bowl. Take another small bowl to mix the powdered sugar and almond flour ,
then sift them together into the bowl where you collected the sandy mixture of butter and flour , mixing the ingredients quickly with your hands . Then add the eggs and continue kneading quickly with your hands to obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough.
Divide the dough into two different small bowls : in one add the cocoa powder and start kneading with your hands until you get a homogeneous dough ball.
In the other, add the remaining 2 tbsps of all-purpose flour and knead it into the dough with your hands until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough ball .
At this point, you will have two dough balls: wrap each in transparent food wrap and refrigerate for at least 2.5 hours. After the resting time, divide each dough ball into two equal parts and start creating a long roll using your hands , until forming a cylinder of about 1 ¼ inches in diameter. Repeat the operation with all 3 remaining dough balls .
Now take a cocoa cylinder and a plain flour cylinder and place them next to each other: intertwine them by overlapping one roll on the other until you reach the end of the rolls : roll the two-color roll obtained, pressing and stretching it slightly with your hands to obtain a new roll about 1 ¼ inches in diameter . Repeat the operation with the other two rolls.
Brush the obtained rolls with a little room temperature water . Then in a small bowl, combine the cinnamon with the sugar and mix the ingredients .
Sprinkle the rolls with the sugar and cinnamon mix obtained and cut the cylinders into slices of ¼ inch thick which you will place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in a preheated static oven at 320°F for 20 minutes (for these cookies, we do not recommend using a convection oven or at most suggest trying the baking of a few pieces as a first batch to check the time and temperature for subsequent ones). Once baked, remove your cocoa and almond diamonds from the oven , let them cool slightly, and enjoy!
Cocoa and almond diamonds can be stored in a tin container for up to 7 days.
They can be frozen if you have used only fresh ingredients: you can store the wrapped dough balls or the intertwined roll in the freezer for up to 1 month. To complete the preparation, you can then thaw and cut them, to bake them according to the recipe.
Do you want to achieve a swirl of flavor? Flavor the dough with untreated orange zest in the cocoa shortbread and cinnamon in the white shortbread!
