instructions:
To prepare the chicken strips with radicchio, take the chicken breast, cut it in half removing any fat parts and the central bone; with a knife, cut thin strips . In a baking dish, pour the oil ,
add the thyme and marjoram leaves and season with salt and pepper .
Grate the zest of an untreated lemon and then place the chicken strips side by side in the baking dish so that the marinade is distributed evenly ; cover with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours .
Wash the radicchio with plenty of fresh running water; remove the base , cut it in half , remove the hard rib and
then cut it into strips lengthwise . Clean and finely chop the onion , let it wilt over low heat in a large non-stick pan with oil for 5 minutes .
Add the water , the brown sugar , cooking for another 5 minutes. Also add the sliced radicchio and cook for 2 minutes, raising the heat .
Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and add it to the vegetables . Cook for 2-3 minutes, and when the chicken browns, turn off the heat . Finally, you can serve and enjoy your chicken strips with radicchio .
It is recommended to eat the chicken strips immediately. Freezing is not recommended.
You can give the chicken marinade an extra boost of flavor by adding balsamic vinegar or soy sauce. Moreover, if you want to opt for a finger-food twist, you can grill the radicchio leaves and use them as "boats" to hold the chicken strips: a simple yet impressive idea!
