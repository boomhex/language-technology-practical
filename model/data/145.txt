instructions:
To prepare the cake with mascarpone in the batter, start by pouring the eggs and sugar into a bowl . Use the beaters for about ten minutes or until the mixture is well risen and frothy .
At this point, you can add the mascarpone one tablespoon at a time . Turn off the beaters and add the vanilla and, through a sieve, pour in the flour ,
the cornstarch and the baking powder . This way, you won't have lumps; turn the beaters on again at low speed and incorporate well .
At this point, you can transfer the mixture into a 9-inch pan, previously buttered and floured . Move on to baking the cake, in a static oven at 340°F for about 50 minutes . When the cake with mascarpone in the batter is cold, sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired .
The cake with mascarpone in the batter can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
You can freeze it already portioned.
To flavor the cake with mascarpone in the batter differently, you can grate orange or lemon zest. Replace part of the cornstarch with almond flour for a delicate taste, or hazelnuts if you prefer a more rustic flavor.
