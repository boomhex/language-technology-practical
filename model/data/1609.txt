instructions:
To prepare the cucumber salad, first clean the spring onions and cut them into very thin slices , then transfer them to a bowl filled with ice water : this way they will have a less pungent flavor and remain crispy. Wash and quarter the yellow cherry tomatoes
and the red cherry tomatoes . Now wash the cucumbers and cut long, thin strips using a vegetable peeler ; once you reach the seed-filled center, turn the cucumber and cut slices from the opposite side as well. Finally, cut the remaining cucumber core into cubes . You will need about 3.5 oz of cucumber strips for the salad and 5.3 oz of cucumber cubes for the dressing.
Place the cucumber cubes in a tall, narrow container, season with salt and pepper, then add the oil , Greek yogurt , and apple cider vinegar .
Blend with an immersion blender until you get a smooth and homogeneous sauce . At this point, you can assemble the salad: arrange the baby spinach leaves on a plate, add the drained spring onions and the colored cherry tomatoes .
Complete the dish by arranging the cucumber strips in a nest shape and dressing with the yogurt dressing : your cucumber salad is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the cucumber salad immediately after preparation.
You can add croutons or walnut kernels for a crunchy note, or some crumbled Roquefort cheese for an extra flavor boost!
