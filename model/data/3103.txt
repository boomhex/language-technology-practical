instructions:
To prepare the coffee pancakes, first separate the egg yolk from the white and set aside the latter. Add the sugar to the yolk, a pinch of salt , and mix with a whisk.
Also add the milk and seed oil , then mix again. Add the instant coffee and stir to dissolve it evenly.
At this point, add the sifted flour and baking powder and mix until you get a smooth, lump-free batter. Set aside and whip the egg white with electric beaters in a clean bowl .
Once whipped to stiff peaks , incorporate it into the coffee mixture , gently folding from bottom to top to avoid deflating it .
Grease a non-stick pan with seed oil , drop spoonfuls of batter into the pan , and cook for 2-3 minutes, until bubbles appear on the surface .
Flip the pancakes and finish cooking on the other side . Transfer them to a serving plate and dust with powdered sugar . For the accompanying sauce: chop the dark chocolate with a knife and heat the cream in a saucepan.
Pour the chocolate into the hot cream and stir to melt it until you obtain a smooth sauce .
Stack the pancakes and let the chocolate drip over the surface . Your coffee pancakes are ready to be enjoyed !
Coffee pancakes are perfect freshly made, but you can store them in the refrigerator in a closed container for up to 2 days. Before consuming, you can quickly reheat them in a pan or microwave.
If you wish, you can add a pinch of unsweetened cocoa to the batter to enhance the coffee flavor.
For an even more indulgent touch, serve the coffee pancakes with whipped cream or mascarpone cream!
