instructions:
To prepare the salad with scrambled eggs, first remove the frozen peas from the freezer and leave them at room temperature for at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the scrambled eggs: crack the eggs into a bowl, add salt and pepper to taste , then lightly beat with a whisk ; the yolks and whites should not be completely mixed. Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan and add the beaten eggs .
Cook for a couple of minutes over medium-high heat until the eggs start to set, then break them up with a whisk, spatula, or fork to achieve the scrambled effect . The eggs should be still soft but not dry . Remove the pan from the heat, transfer the scrambled eggs to a container and set aside .
Cut the cooked ham into cubes and sauté them in a pan with a drizzle of oil for a few minutes . When they are golden , transfer the cubes to a bowl and set aside.
Pour the peas into the same pan used for the ham, adding another drizzle of oil if necessary , and cook for a few minutes, taking care not to let them break down . Set the peas aside and cut the cherry tomatoes in half, after washing them .
Finally, prepare the basil dressing: wash and dry the basil leaves, then put them in a container with the oil and lemon juice and blend with an immersion blender .
Season the dressing with salt and lemon zest and mix well to combine everything. Lastly, toast the slices of bread in a pan with a drizzle of oil .
Now you are ready to assemble your salad: place the mixed greens in a large bowl and add the peas , cannellini beans , cherry tomatoes, and cooked ham .
Add the scrambled eggs and dress with the basil dressing : your salad with scrambled eggs is ready to be served accompanied by slices of toasted bread !
It is recommended to consume the salad with scrambled eggs immediately.
Instead of serving the toasted bread on the side, you can make croutons to add directly to the salad!
