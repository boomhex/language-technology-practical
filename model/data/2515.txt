To prepare the mini quiches with bacon, leeks, and asparagus, start by cleaning and cooking the asparagus. Wash them and dry them thoroughly, laying them on a towel and using a paper towel , then remove the tougher white end, trimming them to promote even cooking . Begin peeling them with a vegetable peeler or a small knife, proceeding vertically from top to bottom, removing the green fibrous part until the stem appears white .
Now tie the asparagus with kitchen string and immerse them in an asparagus pot filled with boiling water . Cook them for 8-10 minutes. If you don't have an asparagus pot, you can cook the asparagus horizontally in a large pot filled with a few inches of boiling water. Once cooked, drain them and gently dry them, then cut the tips and stems into small rounds . Set the asparagus aside.
Now clean the leeks by removing the tougher outer leaves, then slice them into thin rounds . Cook them in a non-stick pan drizzled with extra virgin olive oil over low heat for 4-5 minutes until they are well wilted . Once ready, set them aside.
Cut the bacon into strips and fry it in a non-stick pan, without any additional fat, over medium heat for 3-4 minutes . When ready, set this aside as well, without the cooking fat .
Now beat the eggs with a whisk, seasoning with salt and pepper and adding the cooked leeks and asparagus , keeping some tips aside.
Mix everything well, and finally add the Grana Padano cheese . Now take the pastry discs from the package , remove the paper they are on, and place them in mini quiche molds of 3 inches in diameter placed on a baking sheet .
Fill each pastry disc with a generous amount of the asparagus and leek mixture , then distribute some bacon strips on top and complete with the asparagus tips . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 10 minutes (if using a fan oven, at 356°F for 5 minutes). Once cooked, gently remove them from the molds and place them on a serving plate . Your mini quiches with bacon, asparagus, and leeks are ready, enjoy them hot.
You can store the mini quiches in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, once cooked and cooled, in an airtight container. You can also freeze the mini quiches, always in an airtight container.
If you like, you can make the base of the mini quiches with homemade or ready-made shortcrust pastry: roll it out and cut out thin discs of 4 inches in diameter, using a circular cutter.
