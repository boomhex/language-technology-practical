instructions:
To prepare the omelet rolls, first crack the eggs into a bowl, add salt , pepper, and flavor with some fresh thyme leaves . Beat the eggs with a whisk .
Once the mixture is combined , heat a small amount of oil in a 9.5-inch diameter pan, add the eggs .
Cover with a lid and cook over moderate heat for about 5 minutes or until the omelet is set enough to flip . At this point, place a flat plate the same circumference as the pan on top of the omelet .
Flip the pan and slide the omelet back into the pan to cook the other side for a few more minutes . Transfer the omelet to a cutting board and let it cool slightly .
Drain and chop the mozzarella . Place the slices of speck and the chopped mozzarella evenly over the omelet.
Roll up the omelet . Cut your roll into slices to obtain eight rolls and secure each with a toothpick .
In the same pan where you cooked the omelet, brown the rolls on both sides until a golden crust forms . Remove the toothpicks from the rolls and serve them hot and cheesy .
The omelet rolls can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Freezing is not recommended.
To make your rolls even more succulent, try cooking them with tomato sauce after browning them.
