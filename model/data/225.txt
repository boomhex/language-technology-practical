instructions:
To prepare the easy asparagus pasqualina, start with the dough: in a bowl, combine all-purpose flour and bread flour, then add the yeast and almost all the water . Work with your hands until the dough starts to come together, then transfer to the work surface and add the remaining water a little at a time, continuing to knead .
Once all the water is absorbed, add the salt and knead for about 5 minutes. Gradually add the oil, continuing to work until it is completely absorbed . When the dough is smooth and homogeneous, transfer it to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap . Let it rise at room temperature for about an hour.
Move on to the filling: finely chop the spring onions and set aside. Now, focus on cleaning the asparagus: remove the hard and woody parts , then cut the stalk into slices and halve the tips lengthwise.
In a pan, pour the oil, add the spring onions , and sauté over medium heat for 5 minutes, then add the asparagus . Season with salt and cook over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, boil the eggs for 7 minutes . In a bowl, place the ricotta and soften it with a spoon, add salt and pepper, then pour in the oil .
Add the grated Parmesan cheese and the eggs and mix until you get a homogeneous mixture . Finally, add the spring onions and asparagus , mix again, and set aside.
After the rising time, take the dough and divide it into 2 parts, one about 1 lb (500 g) and the other 10.5 oz (300 g) . Roll out the larger part to obtain a sheet about 0.2 inches thick. Line a 10-inch diameter pan, previously greased, allowing the dough to hang generously over the edges .
Pour the filling into the pan and level the surface , then create 7 hollows with the back of a spoon .
Place the hard-boiled eggs in the hollows . Roll out the second piece of dough and cover the pan .
Trim the excess dough and fold the edges to seal them and form a rim . Brush the surface with oil .
Finally, make 4 cuts with scissors ; this way, the steam created during baking will have escape routes and won't puff up the surface of the pie. Bake in a static oven at 350°F (180°C) for an hour on the middle shelf, then move the pie to the lower shelf, not in contact with the oven base, and continue baking for another 15 minutes. After the baking time, remove from the oven and let it cool slightly . Your easy asparagus pasqualina is ready to be enjoyed !
The easy asparagus pasqualina can be stored in the refrigerator, closed in an airtight container or wrapped in plastic wrap, for 2-3 days.
If you prefer, you can prepare the savory pie dough with a stand mixer instead of by hand.
With the leftover dough, you can create nice decorations to embellish the surface of your easy asparagus pasqualina!
