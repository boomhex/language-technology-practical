Pinza Triestina is a special treat that shines bright during Easter in Trieste—such a beautiful city in Friuli Venezia Giulia. I mean, locals have been making this Italian Easter bread for ages. It's got that community spirit vibe. The dough? Well, it gets worked for quite a while, which gives it that dense yet soft texture. Everyone loves that in traditional Italian bread . And look, what makes Pinza Triestina unique is its not-too-sweet taste—kinda like a tender brioche but with its own character.
You’ll see big, round loaves with three lines scored on top. Pretty much, they pop up in bakeries and homes across Trieste right before Easter. And the aroma? Oh, it's amazing—warm and slightly buttery, just begging you to dive in. But, tradition holds that you wait until Easter morning to share it with family and friends. Honestly, the beauty of Pinza Triestina is its versatility. And it pairs well with just about anything. That's why it’s a hit on tables before and after Easter Sunday. People love to slice it up and enjoy it with local salami, mild cheeses, or even a sweet homemade jam. The combination of flavors—savory meats and the moist, subtly sweet bread—is a classic in Trieste cuisine. Blending tastes is the norm here.
Making this sweet bread recipe is more than just a kitchen task; it’s like a community ritual. Neighbors swap loaves—so so fun—and families pass down their unique twists on the dough, keeping cherished memories alive. While Pinza Triestina is the Easter staple in the north, in Umbria, you might find the ciaramicola. Also, it highlights the diversity in regional Italian baking . There’s something about sharing a thick slice of this festive bread recipe that brings people closer, even after all these years. Whether you’re enjoying it with cheese or savoring that last piece with jam, Pinza Triestina is all about celebrating together and keeping traditions bright.
To prepare the Triestine pinza, the first thing to do is to start with the starter, so in a bowl pour the sifted flour and the dry yeast , then pour the water and knead briefly
after obtaining a somewhat sticky dough cover with plastic wrap and let it rise until it doubles in size , about one to two hours.
After the time has passed, pour the starter into the bowl of a stand mixer , then the egg and 120 grams of sugar ,
then pour 200 grams of sifted flour and start kneading with the hook and as soon as it begins to bind add the salt and 65 grams of butter at room temperature and continue kneading.
Work the dough on a work surface for a few minutes until smooth then place it in a bowl , cover with plastic wrap, and let rise for another 2 hours. After the time has passed, start with the second dough, then transfer the risen dough into the bowl of the mixer ,
add the yolks , the remaining 40 g of sugar, the grated orange and lemon zest , and the remaining 100 grams of flour and knead again for 5 to 10 minutes,
just long enough to make the dough bind well , you'll notice that the bowl of the mixer will stay clean; then add the remaining 75 grams of butter little by little and, when incorporated, transfer the dough to a work surface and divide it into two halves of about 400 grams each .
Using your hands, round the dough well, obtaining two tight spheres , place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , and let rise for another 2 hours. Once the dough has risen well, make Y-shaped incisions with a sharp knife, pushing the knife completely into the sphere until it touches the baking sheet. Perform this operation carefully without dragging the dough while cutting it, so fully submerge the knife into the sphere, entering and exiting each time with the blade.
Brush the surfaces of both pinzas with beaten yolk and milk and bake them both at 329°F for 35 minutes in a preheated oven in fan mode or in static mode at 356°F for 35 minutes. At the end of baking, it is advisable to do the toothpick test in the center of the Triestine pinza before serving it.
The Triestine pinza can be stored covered for 2-3 days; perhaps warm it slightly before slicing it.
The Triestine pinza is already good as it is, but it can become even tastier by adding chocolate chips or rehydrated raisins in water or rum (in this case, they should be added during the last rise). If you have a dome mold, you can also bake it there, always lining with parchment paper and extending the baking time a bit.
The original recipe for Triestine pinza calls for up to 100 grams of yeast for 1 kg of flour, but we chose not to fully adhere to tradition. On the pinzas, you can create various types of cuts: cross, Y, or without following a precise sense, legend has it that these incisions represent the martyrdom of Jesus and that the pinza itself is the sponge from which Jesus drank. It is a not very sweet bread but very rich in eggs, a persistent symbol of Christianity as it recalls the resurrection of Christ, but it is also linked to the ancient tradition of celebrating the arrival of spring, thus having overcome the lean period experienced in winter.
