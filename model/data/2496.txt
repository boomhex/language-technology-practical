To prepare the savory pie with mushrooms and radicchio, start with the How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms : with the help of a sharp knife with a smooth blade, begin by removing the earthy part from the stem, gently scraping it until all traces of dirt are gone . Remove any remaining residues with a brush or a cotton cloth , or if the mushrooms are still very dirty, quickly rinse them under a stream of cold running water. Slice the cleaned mushrooms horizontally into fairly thin slices and set aside.
First, slice the leek into thin rings and then cut the radicchio into strips ; place a large non-stick pan on the stove with a drizzle of oil, together with the leek and let it stew for 5 minutes.
Add the mushrooms, cooking for 4-5 minutes, then add the radicchio . Finely chop the thyme and add it for flavor ;
stir with a kitchen spatula , finally adjust with salt and pepper; cover with a lid and cook for another 4-5 minutes.
Once ready, turn off the heat and let it cool . In a separate bowl, place the ricotta together with the whole egg and grated nutmeg .
Add the finely chopped chives and adjust with salt and pepper to taste . Finally, add the grated cheese and milk (17-18) (set aside a small amount as you will need it later) and mix well with a spatula.
Add the now cooled radicchio and mushrooms to the mixture ; mix everything to blend the ingredients well , then line and oil a 9.5-inch diameter pie pan with a sheet of puff pastry .
Press down on the base and edges with your hands so that they adhere well to the pie pan , then pour in the filling you have prepared , leveling the surface with a spatula .
Fold the outer edges over themselves, creating a small decorative pattern , which you will brush with the remaining milk . Bake in a preheated static oven at 390°F for 40-50 minutes (or at 355°F for 30-40 minutes if using a fan oven). When the pie is ready, turn off the oven and let it cool: finally, you can serve your savory pie with mushrooms and radicchio !
You can store the savory pie with mushrooms and radicchio for up to 2 days in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container. You can freeze it only if you have used fresh, not defrosted, ingredients.
If you like, you can replace the radicchio with spinach and the Grana Padano with grated Pecorino Sardo: what a taste!
