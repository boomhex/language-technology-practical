instructions:
To prepare baked gratinated calamari, start by cleaning the calamari, then cut them into 1-inch rings . Take the bread and roughly chop the crumb. Place it in a blender and add oil , salt , and pepper.
Add parsley , basil , and thyme .
Continue with lemon zest and juice . Blend until you obtain a homogeneous breadcrumb mixture .
Coat the rings in the breadcrumb mixture and place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper . Bake in a static oven at 350°F for 20 minutes, then switch to the fan setting and bake for another 5 minutes. Your baked gratinated calamari are ready to be enjoyed .
Baked gratinated calamari should be consumed immediately, but if there are leftovers, they can be stored in the refrigerator in a closed container for 1-2 days. To reheat, use the oven at 300°F for 10-15 minutes: this way, the breadcrumb coating will regain some crispiness without drying out the calamari.
If you like it spicy, you can add paprika to the breadcrumb coating. For an even crunchier texture, add chopped walnuts, pistachios, or almonds to the coating. For a fresh note, try serving the calamari with a yogurt sauce or a light mayonnaise.
