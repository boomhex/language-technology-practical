instructions:
To prepare the vermicelli with lime and pink pepper, start by cooking the vermicelli in plenty of boiling water, salted to taste . Meanwhile, place the mascarpone in a non-stick pan and, without turning on the heat, add salt and pepper . Wash the lime, extract its juice, and strain it .
Then pour the lime juice into the pan and mix with a spatula to incorporate it into the mascarpone. Drain the pasta al dente, keeping the cooking water aside .
Transfer it directly to the pan with the mascarpone , add a ladle of cooking water and continue stirring so that the mascarpone, with just the heat of the water, softens and becomes a cream .
Add more freshly ground pink pepper and the finely grated lime zest and finish mixing everything. Plate your vermicelli with lime and pink pepper and finish the dish with a sprinkle of grated grana cheese .
Consume your vermicelli with lime and pink pepper immediately. Alternatively, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a maximum of 1 day.
Replace the mascarpone with another spreadable cheese or ricotta.
