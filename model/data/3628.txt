To make the rice fritters, first heat the milk in a pot. Once it reaches a boil, add the orange zest , the sugar , and the rice .
Cook over low heat for 30 minutes, stirring often . Remove the orange zest, transfer everything to a bowl , and let it cool slightly. Meanwhile, beat the eggs with the sugar . You can use a hand whisk or an electric mixer.
Add the sifted flour and baking powder , then mix vigorously until you have a smooth, lump-free batter . Add the rice cream and mix again .
In a pan, heat the oil to 320-340°F and drop a few tablespoons of batter into the oil . Fry the fritters, a few at a time to not lower the oil temperature too much, for 1-2 minutes per side, until they are golden. As you fry them, place the fritters on paper towels to remove excess oil. Once warm, sprinkle with powdered sugar . Your rice fritters are ready to be enjoyed !
Rice fritters are delicious freshly made when they are still warm and fragrant. However, if there are any leftovers, you can store them in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap, for up to 1 day.
For an even more intense aromatic touch, you can add a pinch of cinnamon, vanilla, or nutmeg to the batter. For an even more indulgent variant, add dark chocolate chips to the batter. Instead of dusting with powdered sugar, you can coat the fritters in granulated sugar, preferably citrus-flavored.
