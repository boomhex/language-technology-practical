instructions:
To prepare the peanut butter muffins, start by placing the softened butter cut into pieces at room temperature and the sugar in a stand mixer (or bowl), turn on the beaters to blend the mixture, add the peanut butter and continue to whip the cream until a homogeneous dough is obtained .
Separately, beat the egg with the vanilla extract and half a teaspoon of salt and add them to the peanut butter mixture . Sift the flour together with the baking powder .
Finally, add the milk and the sifted flour together with the baking powder to the dough little by little, alternating them, while stirring with a spatula . When the dough is homogeneous , pour it into the muffin cups, place them in a muffin tin , and bake in a preheated convection oven at 356°F for 20 minutes. Once cooked, take the peanut butter muffins out of the oven and let them cool.
If you only have sweetened peanut butter available, reduce the sugar dose to 180 grams and taste the dough at the end: if it seems not sweet enough, add a bit more.
