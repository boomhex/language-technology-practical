instructions:
To prepare canned pasta and beans, first take care of the vegetables. Slice the carrots and then dice them into 1/2-inch cubes . Do the same for the celery .
Dice the onion into 1/4-inch cubes . Finely chop the chili pepper . In a pot, heat the oil and add the garlic cut in half and the chili pepper . Sauté for 1 minute over medium heat.
Add the onion , the carrots , and the celery .
Add the rosemary , season with salt , and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, place a pot of water on the stove. Deglaze with white wine and let all the alcohol evaporate.
In the meantime, open the can of beans and drain them , rinse them to completely eliminate the canning liquid. Add the beans to the pot and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring well. Remove the garlic and rosemary, then add the tomato puree to the pot .
Cook for 20 minutes, adding hot water to prevent it from getting too thick. Add the uncooked pasta and add hot water to cover it completely. Cook the pasta, adding hot water as needed and stirring occasionally.
Once the pasta is cooked, adjust the salt and turn off the heat. Add a sprinkle of pepper , the Pecorino Romano , and mix well. Your canned pasta and beans are ready to be enjoyed .
Canned pasta and beans can be stored in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for up to 2 days. Before serving it again, reheat it with some hot water to restore the right consistency, avoiding it becoming too dry.
Add more hot water during cooking to achieve a consistency similar to a soup. If you want a richer touch, replace the dry pasta with fresh pasta, such as broken tagliatelle or maltagliati. If you prefer a bolder taste, add crispy bacon or pancetta to the sauté, browning them with the garlic and chili pepper. Instead of water, you can use vegetable broth.
