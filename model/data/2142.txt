instructions:
To prepare strawberry risotto at home, start with the preparation of the Vegetable broth . Boil the vegetables (carrots, celery, tomatoes, and onions) in plenty of salted water for about an hour , then strain the broth through a sieve and set it aside .
Then prepare the risotto: peel and finely chop the shallot , heat the olive oil in a saucepan over low heat, then add the chopped shallot and let it soften for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally; add the rice and toast it for another 2-3 minutes, stirring often.
Once it has changed color, deglaze with the white wine , then let it evaporate. Gradually add the broth , making sure to wait for the liquid to be absorbed before adding more, stir the risotto often to prevent it from sticking . Cook the risotto: it will take about 15-20 minutes, depending on the time indicated on the package of your rice.
While the rice is cooking, wash the strawberries, remove the stems with the leaves , and cut them into pieces . Once the risotto is ready, add salt and turn off the heat.
With the heat off, stir in the goat cheese and butter , mix well to melt them, and finally add the strawberry pieces . Mix the strawberries well and serve the strawberry risotto hot .
It is recommended to consume the strawberry risotto immediately to prevent them from losing color. Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of goat cheese, you can use robiola or stracchino to cream the strawberry risotto; instead of wine, you can use sparkling wine to deglaze the rice.
