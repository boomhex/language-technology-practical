Gnocchi di malga is really all about those tender, old-school mountain vibes you find up in the Lessinia region, just north of Verona. And here's the thing, this gnocchi di malga recipe goes way, way back to the days when shepherds were out in the Prealpi Venete, using whatever simple things they had on hand: flour, hot water, and some pretty amazing cheese from the local malghe. The dough gets its name, "gnocchi sbatùi," because it’s beaten together by hand. Pretty simple. It’s a bit different from your usual potato gnocchi. Once shaped, these moist dumplings get topped off with a load of melted malga butter and a good amount of sharp, aged Monte Veronese DOP cheese, which is super famous around here for its tangy kick.
And listen, unlike fancier dishes, this one comes from a really practical, hard-working mountain life, and you can definitely feel that rustic, honest energy in every bite. Seriously good. In Lessinia, people still get excited about serving up this traditional Italian gnocchi in the malghe and local restaurants, especially when the weather’s chilly and folks want something hearty that sticks with you. It’s kinda cool how this mountain-style gnocchi has made a comeback lately, bringing a little piece of history right to your plate. Don’t expect anything super fancy—what you get here is just pure, golden comfort, dripping with butter, cheese, and all that good stuff.
And you know, some locals like to toss in a few sage leaves for a little extra crispy flavor, but really, the Monte Veronese does most of the heavy lifting when it comes to taste. For sure. Whether you’re trying the gnocchi di malga recipe at a restaurant or thinking about making your own, it’s a great example of Italian alpine food that’s simple but totally satisfying. The mix of tender dumplings and strong, cheesy, buttery sauce makes for a dish that’s not just filling but seriously memorable—definitely not your everyday gnocchi, and that’s what makes it special.
This authentic dish is perfect for those chilly days when you crave something warming and comforting. With each bite, you’re taken on a culinary journey through the beautiful mountains of Veneto, enjoying flavors that have been cherished for generations. The unique character of these gnocchi, combined with the rich and buttery sauce, creates a meal that’s not only delicious but also deeply connected to the landscape and history of the region. If you ever find yourself in Verona, be sure to try this classic—it’s a true taste of the Italian Alps.
To prepare malga dumplings, first, take care of the dough. Heat the water in a saucepan until it reaches 158°F, then use a kitchen thermometer to measure the temperature . If you don't have a kitchen thermometer, to measure the temperature precisely, just divide the water in two: boil half, keep the other half at room temperature, and mix them at the end. Meanwhile, sift the flour into a large bowl and salt it .
When the water has reached the indicated temperature, slowly add it to the previously sifted flour and mix everything vigorously with a wooden spoon to avoid lumps . Work the mixture for a few minutes, almost "beating" it (from this type of processing comes the name "sbatui" dumplings or "beaten" dumplings) until you get a rather fluid dough . If the dough turns out too liquid, add a bit of flour, if instead, it is too hard, add some water.
Put a pot of water on the stove, bring to a boil and salt it. Then transfer part of the dough onto a flat plate and moisten the spoon by dipping it in the cooking water . Form the dumplings by sliding a portion of dough with the spoon directly into the pot with boiling water and cook for about 15 minutes once it returns to a boil, that is, when the water starts boiling again after adding the dough . The cooking time varies depending on the size of the dumpling: if you form smaller dumplings, the cooking time will be less, if you form larger dumplings, the times will exceed the 15 minutes indicated in the recipe.
Now focus on preparing the seasoning: melt the butter in a non-stick pan . When the butter has melted and cooked, reaching an amber color, add the sage leaves and cook until the sage becomes slightly crispy .
Grate the aged Monte and Grana cheeses and mix them in a bowl. Then create a base with the two grated cheeses on the serving plate and when the dumplings are cooked, drain them with a slotted spoon and transfer them onto the cheese layer you have formed .
Season them abundantly with the grated cheeses forming layers and pour over the melted butter and sage mixture . Once everything is mixed and garnished with two sage leaves, your malga dumplings are ready to be served and consumed very hot, accompanied by a classic Valpolicella to enhance the flavor!
You can store malga dumplings in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to a day and heat them before serving. Malga dumplings are a dish to be consumed immediately, so freezing is not recommended.
Monte Veronese is a hard cheese produced with a technique involving the coagulation of milk from more than one milking, and it is from here that its name derives. "Monte", in fact, does not indicate the mountainous relief, but refers to the term "monta", which means milking.
The dough of these dumplings is quite soft; if you have trouble forming them, add a little flour: you will get a denser consistency, and forming the dumplings will be a breeze.
Speaking of flavors: with aged Monte they are special, but if you can't find it, don't like it, or find it too strong, replace it with Grana or another hard-aged cheese. The beauty of cheeses is that there are thousands of them, how can you resist the temptation to try them all?
