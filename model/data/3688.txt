To prepare the cucumber and yogurt cream, start by preparing the Vegetable broth . Then wash and dry the vegetables. Next, clean and finely chop the shallot . Trim the cucumbers, cut them into slices , and then into small cubes : set aside.
Now finely chop the dill and set it aside. Everything is now ready for preparation. Take a non-stick pot with high sides. Sauté the shallot with a drizzle of oil . Stir it occasionally for even cooking until it turns golden. Then deglaze with a ladle of water .
Add the cucumber cubes and cook them for a few minutes, stirring with a spatula . Now, add the hot vegetable broth .
Add the dill and cover with a lid . Let it simmer gently for about 20-25 minutes. After this time, turn off the heat and let it cool slightly. Transfer to a high-sided container .
Blend with an immersion blender until you get a smooth cream . Pour the cream into a large bowl, adjust with salt and pepper , and grate in some untreated lemon zest .
Add the yogurt . Mix the ingredients and now your cucumber and yogurt cream is ready to be enjoyed !
