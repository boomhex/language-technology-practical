instructions:
To prepare the arepas, take a large bowl and pour in the water , salt , and oil , then mix to dissolve the salt.
Add the flour little by little while mixing the mixture with your fingers . Mix all the ingredients well until you get a soft but compact and not sticky mixture . Let it rest in the bowl for 3 minutes to allow the flour to evenly absorb the water.
After this time, divide the dough into portions of about 3 oz each : form balls and flatten them on the palm of your hand to a thickness of 0.6 inches ,
then shape them on the work surface to obtain a regular shape . After forming the discs , heat the oil in a pan
and cook the arepas over medium heat for 4 minutes on one side and 3 minutes on the other , until they begin to brown and develop darker spots. Your Venezuelan arepas are ready to be stuffed and enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume Venezuelan arepas immediately as they tend to harden after cooking. Alternatively, you can freeze them after they have been cooked and completely cooled.
To make arepas, it is essential to use the right flour: to be sure, check that it says “for arepas” on the package. Arepas can also be fried or baked: in the latter case, we recommend brushing the surface with some seed oil and baking in a preheated convection oven at 350°F for about 30 minutes until they are slightly golden.
