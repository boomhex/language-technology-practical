instructions:
To prepare the gluten-free cream puffs, first make the choux pastry. Pour the water, butter , and a pinch of salt into a saucepan. Bring everything to a boil, then remove from the heat and add the rice flour .
Add the corn starch and lupin flour as well. Mix well with a wooden spoon until all the ingredients are combined.
Return to the heat and, while stirring, cook the mixture for about 1 minute . Transfer it to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and turn on the machine. Add one egg and wait for it to be well absorbed before adding the second .
When this is also well absorbed, add the egg yolk . Continue working until you get an elastic and soft dough, then transfer it to a piping bag with a smooth 10 mm tip . Form the cream puffs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper; you need to make puffs of 1.2-1.6 inches, spacing them apart.
Sprinkle the surface with sugar granules and bake in a convection oven at 390°F for about 25-30 minutes. Then remove the gluten-free cream puffs from the oven and let them cool before filling them .
The raw choux pastry must be used immediately; it cannot be prepared in advance. The cooked cream puffs can be stored for about 1 week in a tin box, preferably with holes. Alternatively, they can be frozen for about 1 month.
Instead of sugar granules, you can decorate the cream puffs with chopped nuts. With this dough, you can make eclairs, zeppole, or other shapes.
