instructions:
To prepare pasta with green beans, start by preparing the sauce. After peeling the shallot, chop it finely and place it in a pan with the oil and let it flavor for a few minutes over low heat, then add the tomato sauce ;
adjust with salt and pepper and cook for about 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, wash the green beans and remove the two ends and the central string , then place them in boiling water
and salted, and let them cook for 2-3 minutes ; this way, you will make them more tender. At this point, add the bucatini , and when they are cooked, drain everything together .
As soon as you have drained the bucatini with the green beans, pour them into the pan with the tomato sauce , while you flame it for another minute, mixing to blend the flavors well , and finally plate the pasta with green beans and serve while still hot .
It would be best to consume the pasta with green beans immediately; otherwise, it can be stored for 1 day in the refrigerator in an airtight container. If you want to freeze the green beans, after cooking them for 2-3 minutes, drain them, immerse them in cold water to stop the cooking, and after draining and letting them dry, close them in bags and freeze. Before using them, let them thaw at room temperature!
