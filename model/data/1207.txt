instructions:
To prepare the chicken meatballs with orange, first place the cubed bread in a bowl along with the warm milk and let it soften. In another bowl, add the ground chicken and the orange zest .
Season with the grated cheese , then add the egg and the soaked bread .
Salt and mix the ingredients together with your hands until you obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Take a small portion of the mixture and form a meatball about the size of a walnut . Place the meatballs on a tray lined with parchment paper . Now roll each meatball in flour .
Once finished , heat the oil in the pan , place the meatballs and cook for 5 minutes.
Turn them on all sides and when they are nicely browned , deglaze with the orange juice , cover with the lid and cook on low heat for about 10 minutes.
Finally, remove the lid and adjust the salt if necessary , raise the heat for another 5 minutes to finish cooking and serve the chicken meatballs with orange hot .
We recommend consuming the chicken meatballs with orange immediately; if there are leftovers, you can store them in the fridge for a couple of days, sealed in an airtight container.
Serve the meatballs with a fresh salad made with winter vegetables like radicchio, cabbage, and fennel!
