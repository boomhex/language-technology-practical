With its easy charm and versatile flavor , it becomes one of those always-requested family favorites and a top pick for anyone looking for simple, satisfying treats.
In a bowl, place the mascarpone and ricotta, then mix the two cheeses well with a fork. Add the Marsala and the sugar (the quantity of these two ingredients can be adjusted according to personal taste).
Add the washed and whole blackberries (set aside 4 for decoration). With the help of a fork, lightly crush them to release the juice, leaving some whole pieces. Cut ladyfingers so that they can stand upright in a glass . Fill the glasses with the cheese cream. Decorate the glasses with the blackberries you set aside and with the fruit nut granules .
You can use your preferred fruit to flavor the cream: strawberries, cherries, or raspberries! You can enrich the cream with delicious chocolate chips. Instead of ladyfingers, you can use crumbled cookies to place at the bottom of the glass. Finally, choose the decoration you prefer: hazelnut, almond, or pistachio granules!
