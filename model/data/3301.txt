instructions:
German Christmas bread known as Stollen is one of those tasty holiday treats that's been cherished in Dresden since 1474. Really good stuff. This bread is a festive favorite, combining sweetness and tenderness in every bite. The traditional Stollen is notable for its soft, bread-like texture filled with candied fruit, juicy dried fruit, and crunchy toasted almonds. And look, in Dresden, only about 150 bakers are certified to make the official version—giving you a taste of local history.
One popular twist? The marzipan stick at the center. It adds a nutty richness that blends perfectly with the moist bread and fruity bits. While some breads are great for breakfast, German Christmas bread like Stollen is more of a festive Christmas dessert. The powdered sugar topping—which is awesome—resembles a snowy blanket, making each slice as beautiful as it is delicious.
Although the classic version hails from Dresden, there are many Stollen varieties across Germany, each with a unique twist. However, the Dresden style is considered the gold standard. Seriously, it’s really really good for its softness and flavor-packed nature. Making a Stollen recipe at home requires patience, but the outcome is always rewarding. Plus, the spices fill your home with warmth, and the first bite of golden, fruity bread sets a cozy holiday mood.
Wrapped up, it makes a wonderful homemade gift—pretty much perfect—or centerpiece for any holiday table. Even if you're not in Germany, baking a loaf of traditional Stollen brings a touch of sweet, old-school Christmas magic into your home. Beyond its festive charm, Stollen also has a rich history, making it a meaningful addition to your holiday baking. Whether you're enjoying it with family or gifting it to friends, this bread captures the spirit of togetherness and celebration. The combination of flavors and textures creates a super special experience.
So why not try your hand at this Stollen recipe ? You’ll bring a little piece of German tradition to your kitchen, making your holidays even more memorable. And the sauce? Can't go wrong.
To prepare the stollen, start by cutting the candied orange into slices and then into cubes (1-2). Soak it together with the raisins in a bowl with warm water, so that everything is covered to the brim, and 50 ml of rum taken from the total amount .
In the meantime, place the blanched almonds on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven until they are crunchy but not too colored . If you have almonds with the skin, scald them for 5 minutes in boiling water and then remove the skin, which will come off easily this way. When the almonds are cool, chop them coarsely and set them aside. Grate the lemon zest and ginger into a bowl and set aside .
Dissolve the yeast (you can also use a crumbled cube of fresh brewer's yeast) in a little warm milk (taken from the total amount in the recipe) and add a teaspoon of honey (7-8). Place the flour in a bowl and make a well in the center, where you will pour the yeast .
Mix with a teaspoon, incorporating a little flour into the yeast until you get a batter-like mixture, which you will leave in the center without kneading . Cover everything with plastic wrap and let it rise for at least half an hour in a warm place until the mixture doubles in volume .
While the batter is rising, cut a vanilla bean in half and scrape out its seeds with the blade of a small knife . Place the opened bean and seeds in a bowl containing the remaining milk, which you have warmed . Then melt the butter and let it cool; finally, drain the raisins and candied orange, pat them with paper towels to dry them, pass them through the flour , and then through a sieve to remove the excess.
At this point, in a bowl, beat the two eggs and add the milk in which you had infused the vanilla (removing the bean beforehand) . Add the salt and cardamom and finally
the grated lemon zest and ginger . Pour the yeast and flour mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer (or a large bowl if kneading by hand) and start the machine fitted with the paddle attachment (low speed). Pour the egg and milk mixture into the bowl , then another 50 ml of rum , and the sugar.
Finally, add the melted butter a little at a time . As soon as the ingredients are incorporated, remove the paddle and attach the dough hook, then knead for about 10 minutes until the dough is homogeneous and completely attached to the hook. Add the chopped (cold) almonds, then the floured raisins and candied orange , and knead for a couple of minutes. Place the dough on a work surface, shape it into a round form .
Then place it in a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise for an hour in a warm place . Meanwhile, take the marzipan and shape it into a cylinder . After the rising time, place the dough on a work surface, shape it into a rectangle, and press in the center with a rolling pin, slightly lengthening the dough to create a thicker bulge on the longer sides .
Fold the shorter sides inward to restore the rectangular shape of the dough . Place the marzipan stick in the hollow, towards the larger bulge, then fold the thinner side over the thicker one and
press with the rolling pin in the center to seal well and give the stollen its classic shape . Shape it a little with your hands to give the stollen a regular form and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in a static oven preheated to 356°F for about 60-70 minutes, until the stollen is amber .
Once out of the oven, immediately brush with melted butter and sprinkle with plenty of sifted powdered sugar , then let it cool on a rack. Wrap it in aluminum foil and let the stollen rest in a cool place (but not in the refrigerator) for a couple of days before consuming it, so it absorbs moisture and reaches its classic consistency. Good Stollen and Merry Christmas to all!!
After two days of rest, store the stollen under a glass dome for up to a week.
If you can't find cardamom, you can use cinnamon and nutmeg as an alternative.
