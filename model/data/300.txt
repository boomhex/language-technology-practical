instructions:
To prepare the baked sea bass fillets, first wash the vegetables. Start with the purple cauliflower, separate the florets and divide them into smaller pieces . Do the same for the white cauliflower .
Then also take the broccoli florets . Move on to the carrots, peel them and cut them into slices .
On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, add the broccoli and cauliflower ; also add the carrots and the 3 unpeeled garlic cloves .
Add the lemon thyme , salt , pepper, and a drizzle of oil . Massage the vegetables to distribute the seasoning evenly and cook in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 20 minutes.
In the meantime, move on to the sea bass fillets. Make sure there are no bones, otherwise remove them with tweezers. Then cut each fillet into 3 pieces, making a diagonal cut . Salt the sea bass and season it with oil . Massage it to distribute the seasoning evenly.
When the vegetables are tender, take them out of the oven . Place the sea bass fillets on top with the skin side up and place a piece of anchovy on each . Add another drizzle of oil .
Transfer back to the oven for 15-20 minutes still at 356°F. Then take it out and let it rest for a couple of minutes . Plate by placing the vegetables at the bottom, the fish on top, and finally add some lemon thyme . The baked sea bass fillets are ready to be served.
We recommend consuming the fillets immediately; alternatively, they can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of one day.
Vary the vegetables with those in season. In summer, for example, use zucchini, peppers, and eggplant! If you have whole sea bass, find out how to How to clean the seabass !
