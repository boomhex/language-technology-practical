Ricotta gnudi are a real treat in Tuscany , where they’re kinda like tender Italian dumplings without the pasta shell. And look, the ricotta cheese really does all the talking. The name “gnudi” means “naked” in Tuscan, perfectly capturing these fluffy bites—imagine ravioli minus the dough. In Tuscany, folks love this dish for keeping things simple. But, really, it’s all about big flavors, especially when paired with a vegetable ragu featuring local stars like the sweet, mild Aglione garlic from Valdichiana. Throw in a silky saffron sauce, and bam, this classic recipe gets a modern twist with a burst of color and a touch of creamy richness. Inspired by Silvia Baracchi at Il Falconiere, this homemade gnudi recipe hits that sweet spot between down-to-earth and a bit fancy.
In Tuscany, many grew up enjoying these vegetarian gnudi , especially in rural areas where making food stretch was key. Thing is, the real magic lies in using fresh, local ingredients, so every bite bursts with those authentic flavors you'd expect from true Italian dumplings . This veggie ragu isn't just any sauce—it's packed with chopped veggies that turn soft and juicy, offering layers of sweet, earthy notes, and a hint of that zesty saffron warmth in every forkful. Compared to regular gnocchi or ravioli, gnudi are lighter, almost fluffy, and soak up every drop of sauce. People in places like Cortona and the Valdichiana stick to old recipes but aren’t shy about trying new twists—like this saffron version. And here's the thing: whether you're into gnudi with vegetable sauce or just need a break from heavy pasta, this dish is spot on for anyone craving meatless Italian food with a touch of elegance. Honestly, it's a great way to enjoy a piece of Tuscany at home, with each mouthful bringing you a bit closer to the beautiful Italian countryside.

Already formed and raw ricotta gnudi can be stored in the fridge, covered, for up to 12 hours. They can be frozen for about a month and boiled while still frozen.
Cooked ricotta gnudi should be consumed within a day, stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container.
It is advisable to drain the ricotta in a sieve for a few hours in the refrigerator, so it will lose its whey and the dough won't be too soft.
If you can't find aglione, you can use regular garlic.
The vegetables can be varied according to the season: use asparagus and peas in spring, pumpkin and kale in winter. To keep them crispy, salt them only at the end of cooking so they won't release their liquid.
For a bolder taste, you can add a few drops of lemon or a pinch of chili pepper to the saffron sauce.
