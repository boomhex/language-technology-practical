To prepare the rustic savory babà, start by preparing the ingredients for the filling: wash the broccoli rabe under running water , then pour a drizzle of oil into a large pot, add the broccoli rabe , lightly salt, and cover with a lid . Let them wilt over medium heat for about 5-8 minutes.
In the meantime, remove the casing from the sausage and cut it into pieces ; place the sausage in a pan and brown over medium heat for about 5 minutes, without adding any other fats .
When the broccoli rabe are wilted , set them aside along with the browned sausage and let both preparations cool. Finally, cut the scamorza cheese into cubes . Now you can turn your attention to the babà dough: pour the all-purpose flour and Manitoba flour into a stand mixer fitted with a hook ,
add the salt , sugar , and crumbled fresh yeast and start mixing at medium speed.
Add the egg and continue kneading until completely incorporated, then pour in the milk in a stream without stopping the mixer . Finally, add the butter, one piece at a time , ensuring it is completely absorbed before adding more.
Continue kneading at medium speed until you have a smooth and compact dough . Transfer the dough to a bowl and add the sausage , the broccoli rabe
and the scamorza cheese , then knead with your hands to incorporate them into the mixture . Now take a babà mold with a diameter of 20.5 cm (measured at the open part - 6 inches at the base and 3.5 inches in height) and butter it thoroughly (alternatively, you can use extra virgin olive oil) .
Shape the dough into a sausage form and insert it into the mold , cover it with plastic wrap and let it rise for at least an hour or until the dough reaches the edge of the mold. Once risen, remove the plastic wrap and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 75 minutes, positioning it in the lower part, until it is nicely golden.
After the cooking time, remove the babà from the oven and let it cool slightly , then turn it out onto a wire rack and remove the mold . Your rustic savory babà is ready to be enjoyed warm or at room temperature !
You can store the rustic savory babà in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. It can be frozen in slices if you used fresh, not defrosted, ingredients.
The classic combination of sausage and broccoli rabe can be varied with other ingredients to your liking: for a vegetarian version, for example, try replacing the sausage with olives or sun-dried tomatoes!
