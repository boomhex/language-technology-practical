To prepare the lactose-free tea cake, first bring 200 g of water to a boil and infuse the tea bags. Take 150 g of tea and let it cool completely. In a bowl, place the eggs, sugar , and a pinch of salt, then beat with an electric mixer until you obtain a homogeneous mixture . At this point, add the now cold tea .
Also pour in the seed oil and mix quickly , then add the flour .
Add the baking powder and blend everything with the mixer . Transfer the mixture into a 9.5-inch diameter bundt cake pan , oiled and floured, and bake in a static oven at 350°F for 45-50 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the glaze: in a bowl combine the powdered sugar and water , then mix well with a whisk until you obtain a smooth mixture .
Check the baking with a toothpick, then remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan. Once cool, turn it out onto a serving plate and cover it with the glaze . Garnish as desired with edible flowers and serve your lactose-free tea cake !
