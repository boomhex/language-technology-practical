Pasta with mushroom rosé sauce is a sumptuous dish, perfect for fall and winter. Typically crafted with penne, this pasta dish boasts pan-fried mushrooms, harmoniously blended with a tomato base and a hint of heavy cream for creaminess. We've opted for frozen porcini mushrooms in this rendition, but fresh porcini during their season or the year-round available champignon mushrooms work just as well. Traditional dishes like this come with variations aplenty: some prefer ricotta over heavy cream, while others introduce peas, bacon, or sausage. Our focus today is on the classic combination of mushrooms, tomato sauce, and a touch of cream. Give the pasta with mushroom rosé sauce a try. It's not just suited for Sunday feasts or lunch gatherings, but its quick preparation also makes it a reliable go-to for weeknight dinners!

To prepare pasta with mushroom rosé sauce , start by boiling a large pan of lightly salted water for the pasta.
Finely chop the onion.
In a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Sauté the onion until golden, about 3 minutes.
Add mushrooms and stir.
After 5 minutes, blend in the tomato puree. Continue cooking and stirring the sauce for around 10 minutes until it thickens.
Stir in heavy cream, a touch of salt, and a dash of pepper, cooking for an additional 2 minutes.
As the water boils, cook the pasta until al dente, about 2 minutes shorter than the package recommendation.
Drain and transfer directly to the saucepan. Stir and continue cooking for 2 more minutes. If the sauce seems dry, stir in a spoonful of pasta water.
Once done, serve promptly, garnished with freshly chopped parsley.
Pasta with mushroom rosé sauce is best enjoyed fresh. If you have leftovers, seal them in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to a day. For reheating, briefly bake in the oven until golden, around 5 minutes.
MUSHROOMS: Whether using fresh or frozen mushrooms, here's what you need to know:
PASTA: Penne is ideal for this sauce due to its ability to absorb flavors. However, other short pastas like fusilli are suitable. For quicker cooking, opt for fresh varieties like tagliatelle or fettuccine.
CREAM: Both fresh heavy cream and cooking cream work well. The latter results in a richer, creamier sauce. The key lies in the moderate use of cream, ensuring a creamy texture without being overly heavy. If preferred, substitute heavy cream with ricotta or a creamy spreadable cheese.
