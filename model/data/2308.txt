To prepare the strozzapreti with swordfish, cherry tomatoes, and capers, start by desalting the capers under running water, rinsing them thoroughly several times. Then set them aside. Next, take the cherry tomatoes and cut each into 4 parts . Move on to the swordfish: remove the skin, cut it into strips about 3/4 inch wide, then cube it : set the cherry tomatoes and swordfish aside. Now drizzle a non-stick pan with a little oil and let the peeled whole garlic brown (this way it will be easier to remove later) . Let it sauté for about 2-3 minutes over moderate heat.
Add the cherry tomatoes and the desalted capers , then season with salt and pepper. Let it cook for about 10 minutes over low heat.
At this point, also add the swordfish and stir the ingredients to ensure even cooking. Let it cook over low heat for another 5 minutes. Now add half the finely chopped parsley .
Stir the ingredients to combine the flavors . Then remove the garlic and turn off the heat. Meanwhile, cook the pasta in plenty of boiling water, salted to taste .
When it's cooked, drain it and add it directly to the pan with the fish and cherry tomato sauce . Sprinkle with the remaining parsley (also finely chopped) and mix the ingredients, then plate your strozzapreti with swordfish, cherry tomatoes, and capers and serve them hot.
It is recommended to consume the strozzapreti with swordfish, cherry tomatoes, and capers as soon as they are ready. If you have leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 1 day.
It is not recommended to freeze the ready-made pasta. However, you can freeze the fish sauce for up to 1 month if fresh and not previously frozen ingredients were used.
Feel free to flavor this sauce with your preferred herbs, for example by replacing parsley with thyme. Also, if the taste of swordfish is too strong for you, you can opt for the more delicate monkfish!
