One of Giada De Laurentiis' favorite things about Chicken Marsala is the way that mushrooms soak up the rich, sweet flavor of Marsala wine - so she thought that would make a great addition to a vegetarian pasta dish. She finds this is a great time to choose some great quality trumpet or porcini mushrooms so the flavors can shine, but just about any regular mushroom will work great for this - such as cremini or baby bella. With freshly grated parmesan cheese, arugula, and a sprinkling of pistachios at the end, this Paccheri pasta with Marsala mushrooms is one of those pasta dishes that works just as well for a casual weeknight as it does for a dinner party with company.
Paccheri pasta is one of Giada's absolute favorites because of its shape, but you can absolutely make this dish with penne, rigatoni, or any other tube-shaped pasta.
Note - you can make this dish entirely vegetarian by using vegetable broth in place of chicken!
