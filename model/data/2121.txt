To prepare the frozen fruit, start by cleaning the melon: cut off the ends to create a stable base, then slice it in half and remove the seeds inside with a spoon ; cut each half into slices not too thick , remove the rind from each slice, and finally cut them into cubes about 0.8 inches thick .
Spread the cubes out on a tray, being careful not to overlap them , cover with plastic wrap, and transfer to the freezer: when the fruit has hardened, you can transfer it into a freezer bag for at least 12 hours. Now move on to cleaning the pineapple: remove the base and the crown by cutting them off with a knife , then cut the pineapple into 4 wedges, remove the woody core , and peel it;
cut each wedge in half lengthwise and then slice the pieces into chunks about 0.4 inches thick , then spread the pineapple on a tray , cover with plastic wrap, and transfer it to the freezer: when the pineapple has hardened, transfer it into a freezer bag for at least 12 hours. For more information on cleaning pineapple, you can check our cooking school " How to clean and cut the pineapple ". To clean the mango, remove the skin with a vegetable peeler ,
then make lengthwise cuts with the knife and separate the slices one at a time , until only the pit remains in your hand ; cut each slice into cubes about 0.8 inches thick ,
spread them evenly on a tray , cover with plastic wrap, and leave in the freezer for at least 12 hours. Now attend to the strawberries: wash and dry them, then remove the stems and cut them in half ; at this point, you can transfer them onto a tray, without overlapping , and leave them in the freezer to freeze for at least 12 hours.
Finally, wash and gently dry the blackberries and transfer them onto a tray, keeping them whole , then place it in the freezer for at least 12 hours. When the fruit is frozen, you can blend it to create your refreshing dessert: pour the frozen melon into a blender or a mixer equipped with steel blades and blend until creamy, then transfer to a bowl .
Similarly, pour the frozen pineapple into the blender and blend until you achieve a creamy consistency ; do the same with the mango ,
with the strawberries , and with the frozen blackberries . Transfer your frozen fruit into separate bowls and serve immediately !
Frozen fruit, once blended, should be served immediately to enjoy it with the right consistency.
We do not recommend storing already blended frozen fruit in the freezer as it would harden too much. Non-blended frozen fruit can be stored in the freezer for about 3 months; in this case, once the 12 hours of freezing have passed, you can transfer the fruit into appropriate freezer bags for more convenient storage.
If you wish, when it's time to blend, you can loosen the frozen fruit with yogurt, milk, or water… like magic, you'll get a delicious smoothie or milkshake with an ice cream effect!
