instructions:
To prepare colcannon, start by peeling the potatoes and cutting them into chunks about 1.2 inches . Place them in a large pot and cover with plenty of water
Boil the potatoes for 10 minutes, then drain them . Meanwhile, also clean the cabbage by removing the first darker and tougher leaves . Use a knife to cut away the base
and then cut the more tender leaves into julienne strips (you should get 12 oz of cabbage) . Clean the scallions and finely chop them . In a saucepan, pour the extra virgin olive oil and when hot, add the cabbage and let it sear for 10 minutes . Stir often to ensure even cooking and prevent the leaves from burning.
Add the chopped scallions and cook for another 5 minutes . Finally, lower the heat and add the milk , stir and also add the potatoes, mashing them directly in the pan .
Salt and cook for a few minutes over low heat, stirring as if it were mashed potatoes , and as soon as everything thickens, pour it onto a serving dish . Create a well in the middle and place the butter in one or two pieces, which will almost immediately melt upon contact with the heat of the preparation: your colcannon is ready to be enjoyed while still steaming hot !
You can store colcannon in a resealable glass container for up to 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
This dish can become more aromatic by adding a few sprigs of thyme or parsley. But if you want to make it truly irresistible, then try adding some grated cheese!
