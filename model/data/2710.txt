instructions:
If you're on the hunt for a classic Roman dessert , crostata ricotta e visciole is a must-try. It’s from the historic Roman Ghetto, where the Jewish community mixes their culinary traditions with the cucina romana . And you know what? The result is both rustic and super special. At its heart, there's a tender pasta frolla—super buttery and soft—that cradles a unique filling. First up is ricotta di pecora , which is smooth and rich. Then a bit of custard adds a little extra moist texture. Finally, there's a layer of sour visciole cherries, giving it a sweet yet sharp bite that really balances out the creaminess. Really really good.
And listen, in Rome, a genuine crostata ricotta e visciole is best savored in the old neighborhoods, where traditional bakeries keep these original recipes alive. This ricetta crostata ricotta e visciole is like tasting history, layering flavors much like the city's own story. Some might use amarene (sour cherries) or regular cherries, but the authentic version has marmellata di visciole . That's what gives it that distinctive flavor. Pretty simple.
People sometimes compare it to a crostata ricotta e amarene or crostata ricotta e ciliegie, but the Ghetto’s version stands out. It’s less sweet, more tart, and has an almost crispy edge from the fruit. A popular choice for holidays or a Sunday treat—always a hit with fans of rich, desserts. The joy here is in its simplicity, yet it’s packed with flavor. Each bite is a reminder of the Roman-Jewish heritage, a taste of history and tradition that’s been savored for generations. Whether you're indulging in a cozy Roman bakery or making it at home, it's a delicious way to experience a piece of Rome’s rich cultural tapestry. For real.
To prepare the ricotta and sour cherry tart, melt the butter over very low heat, then let it cool. In a bowl, pour the sifted flour, sugar, and baking powder . Grate the lemon zest , create a well in the center, and pour in the egg yolks ,
the egg white , and lastly the melted butter . Mix the ingredients directly in the bowl , then work it on a work surface just long enough to form a smooth dough.
Shape it into a rectangular form and wrap it in plastic wrap , then place it in the refrigerator to firm up for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the cream: in a saucepan, pour the yolks, sugar , mix with a whisk, and also add the rice starch . Alternatively, you can use cornstarch or potato starch.
Add the cream and milk (10-11), mix with the whisk to combine them and turn on the low heat. Add the seeds of half a vanilla bean and cook the cream, continuing to stir with the whisk
until you have achieved the ideal creamy consistency ; transfer the cream into a bowl and cover it still warm with plastic wrap in contact to prevent the annoying skin from forming on the surface as it cools. Once it has cooled to room temperature, place it in the refrigerator. Meanwhile, take the ricotta (which you will have drained for at least two hours or better yet the night before) and sieve it with a fine-mesh strainer, repeating the operation several times to make it creamier .
Add the powdered sugar and mix to combine the ingredients; cover the cream and place it in the refrigerator. Now dedicate yourself to the sour cherries: remove each stem and pit , then pour them into a pan
add the sugar and cook them over moderate heat with the lid on for at least 20 minutes or until the liquid has almost completely evaporated, stirring occasionally . At that point, turn off the heat and let them cool. Then take the pastry, roll out half the dough into a disc about a quarter inch thick
butter and flour a 11-inch diameter pan; roll the pastry disc onto the rolling pin and unroll it onto the pan. Roll the rolling pin over the edges to eliminate the excess dough (you can combine the scraps with the other half of the pastry), make the pastry adhere perfectly to the pan, and garnish the bottom with a layer of custard , then also pour in the cooked sour cherries, now cold
and cover it all with the ricotta cream , distributed evenly. Roll out the other half of the pastry dough along with the scraps and cover with the obtained disc . Seal the edges well so that the filling doesn't leak out during baking, then brush the surface with a beaten egg with a tablespoon of cream . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 50 minutes (320°F for 40 minutes if using a fan oven).
Once cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool , then turn it over to form it and serve the ricotta and sour cherry tart for a delicious end of meal !
Store the ricotta and sour cherry tart in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 2-3 days. You can freeze it if you have used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
If you do not like the sour taste of sour cherries, you can always opt for cherries following the same procedure but cooking them without sugar!
