instructions:
To prepare the vanilla sauce, pour the cream and milk into a saucepan; slit the vanilla bean lengthwise ,
scrape the seeds out with a knife and add them to the cream and milk ; then add the vanilla pod to the saucepan and bring to a boil over low heat; then turn off the heat and leave to infuse for about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, pour the sugar into a bowl and add the egg yolks and beat them with an electric mixer or a stand mixer, until you get a light and frothy mixture.
At this point, after the 30 minutes of infusion, add the liquid part to the whipped egg yolks by filtering it through a strainer ; gently mix with a whisk and return the cream to the saucepan over very low heat.
Stir and let the cream thicken, but never bring it to a boil ; if you have a thermometer make sure not to exceed 181°F. Once ready , if you don't use the cream immediately, you can store it covered with plastic wrap adhering well to the cream itself so that a skin doesn't form on the surface. Otherwise, use it to accompany the desserts you prefer!
Store the vanilla sauce in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap touching the surface for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
The vanilla bean and seeds give an intense aroma to the sauce; alternatively, we recommend using another natural flavor like vanilla extract.
