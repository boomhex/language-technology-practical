Whenever I need a fast favorite or want a no-stress hit for company, Reginette shrimp and peppers is a plate I trust time and time again.
To prepare the reginette with shrimp and peppers, start by heating the oil in a large pan and fry the garlic with its skin . Once it is browned, remove it from the pan. At this point, add the shrimp that you have washed thoroughly with plenty of water. Let your shrimp flavor for about two minutes . Then add the wine .
When the wine has evaporated, turn off the heat, remove the shrimp and set them aside, keeping them warm . Next, prepare the peppers. Take the peppers, wash and dry them, then cut them in half, remove the green stem, the white filaments, and the seeds inside . Then cut them into vertical strips and proceed by cutting them into cubes .
Add the chili pepper to the pan with the shrimp cooking base and then add the chopped peppers . Adjust with salt and pepper. Then add some ladles of the reginette cooking water to better bind the mixture .
Meanwhile, bring the water to a boil for cooking the reginette. At this point, take the saffron packet. Dissolve the saffron in a little of the pasta cooking water . Once completely dissolved, add the saffron to the peppers in the pan and add the parsley . Now shell and clean the shrimp (for shrimp cleaning, refer to the cooking school: How to clean shrimp ). Remove the head and legs, slide off the shell and remove the tail. Remember to also remove the intestinal filament on the back . Your shrimp are ready.
With all the components ready, focus on cooking the reginette. Cook the reginette in abundant salted boiling water . When the reginette are slightly al dente, drain them and continue cooking in the pan until they absorb the saffron, obtaining a yellow color. When nearly finished cooking, add the shelled shrimp and finish cooking .
The dish should be consumed immediately after cooking. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
For a more flavorful touch to your dish, you can add other vegetables to your liking, such as zucchini.
