instructions:
To prepare the savory madeleines with green olives, pour the flour into a bowl, add the baking powder for savory recipes , pour in the grated Parmesan , and the salt .
Lightly beat the eggs and add them to the rest . Mix, and when the mixture is smooth, add the milk and oil .
Stir to incorporate the milk and set aside for a moment. Take the olives, slice them into rings , then add them to the rest of the mixture ; stir again.
Butter a madeleine mold using a pastry brush . Spoon the mixture into the mold . Let it rest in the fridge for at least an hour. Then preheat the oven to 392°F and bake your madeleines: let them cook for the first 10 minutes on the lower shelf and for the last 10 minutes move them to the top shelf to finish baking. Once done, remove the savory olive madeleines from the oven and let them cool slightly before unmolding and serving .
Store the savory olive madeleines for 1-2 days under a glass dome.
They can be frozen if you've used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.

You can substitute Parmesan with Pecorino for a stronger flavor.
