To prepare the rolled sea bass fillets, first start by cleaning the fish. Take the first sea bass, place it under running water in the sink, and then use a scaler to remove the scales . Next, cut along the belly of the fish up to the head using a pair of scissors . Remove the innards ,
then rinse thoroughly under running water to remove blood and any residues . Transfer back onto the cutting board, remove the head , and then, holding the knife parallel to the work surface, make a deep cut along the backbone of the sea bass, close to the bone, to separate the first fillet .
Turn the fish over and repeat the process on the other side to obtain the second fillet. Using a sharp knife, remove the central reddish part of the fillets and use tweezers to remove any remaining bones . Holding the knife horizontally, finally separate the flesh from the skin . Repeat with the second sea bass to obtain 2 more skinless fillets.
Now move on to the zucchini: wash them and cut into very thin slices lengthwise , then grill for a few minutes on each side on a hot grill . Proceed with assembling the rolls. First, make a vertical cut in the center of each fillet to obtain 2 narrower fillets from each .
Place on the cutting board, one above the other, 3 slices of bacon and lay a narrow fillet on top . Finally, place a slice of grilled zucchini on top of the fillet .
Roll the bacon, fillet, and zucchini onto themselves to form your rolls and secure them with a toothpick to prevent them from opening . Heat the oil in a large non-stick pan, and when it's hot, place the rolls to brown for 2-3 minutes, turning them often on all sides using a pair of tongs .
Season with salt and pepper, then deglaze with the Prosecco . Wait for the wine to evaporate: at this point, the rolls will be ready . Serve and enjoy the rolled sea bass fillets with smoked bacon and grilled zucchini with Prosecco hot .
The rolled sea bass fillets can be stored in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for up to 2 days. They can be prepared and frozen, preferably before cooking.
For your rolls, you can use a slice of speck or prosciutto instead of bacon: you'll see how delicious they are!
