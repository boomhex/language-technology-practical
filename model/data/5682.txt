To make pan-fried fennel, start by washing the fennel, then clean them by cutting off the base of the core and the stems (you can use the latter to flavor a soup or broth). Cut each fennel in half and then proceed to cut them into wedges . Once the fennel is cut, you can proceed with cooking: heat the extra virgin olive oil in a pan with two cloves of garlic .
Flavor with thyme sprigs , then add the fennel wedges . Season with salt .

Pepper to taste and cover with a lid . Cook for 5 minutes over medium heat (if you prefer a softer final texture you can continue cooking for a few more minutes). Shake the pan occasionally to move them, without breaking them. After the 5 minutes, remove the lid, increase the flame, and cook for about 7-8 minutes until they are nicely colored , always shaking the pan for even cooking. Once ready serve hot.
Store the pan-fried fennel in the refrigerator in an airtight container for a couple of days. It is possible to freeze them.
