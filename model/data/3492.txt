To prepare the pumpkin cappuccino, start by removing the skin and seeds from the pumpkin with the help of a spoon and cutting the flesh into cubes . Peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes as well . Clean the leek and chop it very finely .
In a saucepan, heat 4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, let the leek soften and add the pumpkin and potato pieces ,
then incorporate the finely chopped rosemary . Sauté to flavor the vegetables, then add the vegetable broth and cook until done . Once the potatoes and pumpkin are cooked, let them cool slightly and blend them to obtain a creamy velouté. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. Then, focus on preparing the cappuccino foam: in a bowl, mix the robiola and fresh cream and whip them until you get a frothy and soft mixture , then season with a little salt and pepper. You can now assemble your pumpkin cappuccino: distribute the velouté in small cups or cappuccino cups, add a dollop of cheese and cream foam (or a swirl using a pastry bag), garnish with a teaspoon of plum jam and decorate with some sliced almonds. Serve the pumpkin cappuccino immediately!
