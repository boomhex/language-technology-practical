instructions:
To prepare fregola with cod, first take the cod already desalted and remove the bones , then cut it into small pieces. Crush a clove of garlic and put it in a pan to brown with 1 ½ tbsp of oil , then remove it. Add the cod in the pan and deglaze with white wine .
Cook for 7 minutes, then set aside . In the same pan pour another 1 ½ tbsp of oil , heat slightly, then add the fregola .
Toast it and continue cooking as if it were a risotto, by pouring hot vegetable broth as needed until covered , allowing it to be absorbed before adding more. Check the fregola's cooking after 12 minutes. Soak the capers in lukewarm water after rinsing them well under water to desalt them.
Wash and cut the cherry tomatoes into wedges, season them with 1 ½ tbsp of oil, salt, marjoram, and thyme . After 12 minutes of cooking the fregola, add the cod , the cherry tomatoes, capers, and olives, let them flavor for a minute , taste and adjust with salt if needed. Complete with chili to taste, a drizzle of oil, and a grated lemon zest. The fregola with cod is ready to be enjoyed.
We recommend consuming the fregola with cod immediately.
