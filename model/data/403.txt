instructions:
To prepare the tagliolini pie, start with the salami: peel it and first cut it into slices and then into cubes about 0.6 inches . Do the same with the provolone .
In a bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk , salt , and pepper .
Add the tagliolini and gently mix with tongs . Add the cubed salami, reserving a few pieces .
Do the same with the provolone . Mix well and pour everything into a buttered pan lined with breadcrumbs .
Level the mixture and add the remaining salami and cheese cubes on top. Sprinkle with grated Parmigiano Reggiano DOP . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 20-30 minutes. If necessary, turn on the grill for a few minutes to further brown the surface. Remove from the oven and serve your tagliolini pie hot or at room temperature !
The tagliolini pie can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container.
If you use fresh tagliolini, you can add them directly to the mixture as indicated in the recipe. Check the cooking time indicated on the package: if it's more than 1-2 minutes, boil them first. You can use any cured meats and cheeses you prefer. For an even crunchier crust, sprinkle with breadcrumbs!
