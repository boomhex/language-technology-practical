To prepare the Black Forest zuccotto, start with the cocoa cookie dough: in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, whip the egg whites with the sugar until you obtain a creamy and glossy consistency. Beat the yolks with a fork and incorporate them into the mixture with a spatula .
Mix gently , then sift the all-purpose flour and the baking powder into the batter.
Also incorporate the sifted cocoa powder and finally pour in the oil , always mixing with a spatula .
Pour the batter into a baking tray about 18x15 inches, greased with oil and with the base lined with baking paper , level it well with the spatula and bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for about 15-20 minutes on the middle rack. Remove from the oven .

Immediately invert the hot cake , then cover the entire surface with cling film and let it cool. Pit the cherries and cook them in a pan with the sugar and the liqueur .
Let them cool completely and prepare the syrup: bring the water to a boil with the sugar , let it cool slightly and add the liqueur .
Let the syrup cool completely . Once the cookie dough has cooled, using a wheel, cut out a 10-inch disc, a 6-inch disc, and from the remaining scraps, also cut out a disc about 8 inches which will be used as the base . Work on the filling: in the stand mixer with a whisk attachment, add the mascarpone and powdered sugar .
Add the fresh cream and whip the cream until it's fluffy and homogeneous . Take 500 g of the mixture and add the cooked cherries ; store the rest of the mixture in the fridge, as it will be used for decorating.
Line a zuccotto mold about 4 inches high and with a 8-inch base diameter with cling film. Place the largest cookie dough disc inside and moisten it with the syrup . Pour half of the filling inside the mold .
Then lay the smallest cookie dough disc and moisten it on both sides . Add the remaining filling, then close with the intermediate disc cut from the scraps .
Moisten slightly and close the surface with cling film . Refrigerate for at least 3 hours. After the resting time, unmold the zuccotto onto a serving plate .
Remove the cling film and cover the entire surface with a thin layer of the remaining cream and mascarpone mixture . Using a potato peeler, create chocolate curls and adhere them to the surface of the zuccotto .
Finally, with a piping bag, create a border at the base and decorative tufts on the surface , completing with three cherries placed in the center . Allow to cool in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving your Black Forest zuccotto.
The Black Forest zuccotto keeps in the fridge for a couple of days.
For a non-alcoholic version, you can replace the kirsch with a fruit juice-based syrup.
