Shrimp with orange on pumpkin puree is, honestly, a super tasty taste of coastal Italian cooking. You know, folks there just love mixing the sweet, tender flavors of local veggies with the fresh taste of the sea. This shrimp with orange appetizer? It feels fancy and moist, yet sticks to those simple, bright tastes everyone loves from the Mediterranean. Pretty cool, right? The pumpkin puree recipe offers a surprising twist—pumpkin in Italy usually pairs with sausage or mushrooms, but, and here's the thing, it gets a fresh makeover next to juicy, golden shrimp. A splash of fresh orange adds a big citrus aroma. So good. The bright colors pop: deep orange cream with rosy pink prawns on top, all glossy and shiny. This classic mix of seafood and veggies from the Ligurian or Campanian coast gets a little twist, and it just works beautifully. You get a smooth, sweet pumpkin base that lets the shrimp taste really really clean, while the orange makes everything smell amazing.
In Italy, folks love to highlight their best ingredients, and the shrimp and pumpkin dish is a perfect example. To be honest, instead of using heavy sauces, this style lets the shrimp keep their delicate, almost tender bite, while the pumpkin adds a soft, creamy layer underneath. Often called a pumpkin seafood recipe , it stands out at dinner parties or any get-together where you want the food to look as good as it tastes. The whole tangy, fresh vibe with the orange zest and juice makes the shrimp pop even more, giving you a little surprise with every bite. Which is great. Compared to other seafood starters, this one is lighter but still feels like a treat. Italian cooks often experiment with these pairings—shrimp and orange sauce, pumpkin and shrimp combination—because the ingredients are just that good when they’re fresh. This shrimp and pumpkin puree appetizer brings a crispy edge from the shrimp, a silky finish from the pumpkin, and a sweet-citrus kick that’s hard to forget. It's a beautiful example of Italian culinary creativity, celebrating the harmony of land and sea. For sure.
To prepare the orange shrimps on pumpkin cream, first remove the pumpkin skin, then cut it into slices about 3/4 inch thick , remove the seeds and inner filaments , and cut it into cubes .

When the pumpkin is cooked , transfer it to a bowl, removing the excess water, and blend it with an immersion blender until smooth and homogeneous .
