instructions:
To make the butter and egg-free tart first prepare the shortcrust pastry: pour the whole cane sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment , then add the water and the grated lemon zest .
Add also the grated orange zest and salt . Turn the mixer on low speed and mix for a minute, then pour in the vegetable oil .
Add the flour and baking soda and mix everything with the paddle until you get a soft and homogeneous dough . Transfer the dough onto the work surface, form it into a loaf and wrap it in plastic wrap . Let the shortcrust pastry rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour.
After the resting time, roll out the shortcrust pastry on a slightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1/8-3/16 inch . You can alternatively roll it out between two sheets of parchment paper. Roll the pastry onto a rolling pin and unroll it over a 8x11 inch rectangular pan . Press with your fingers to adhere it to the base and edges and trim the excess pastry with a knife.
Fill the shortcrust shell with raspberry jam spreading it with the back of a spoon . Quickly knead the pastry scraps again, roll it out again to a thickness of 1/8-3/16 inch and cut strips about 1/2 inch wide . Place the pastry strips over the jam first in one direction and then in the other .
Remove the excess pastry and bake the tart in a static oven at 350°F for 30 minutes . Once cooked, take it out of the oven and let it cool in the pan . Your butter and egg-free tart is ready to be served!
The butter and egg-free tart can be stored at room temperature for about 3 days, covered with a dome.
If you wish, you can add some chopped nuts to the jam for a crunchy note!
You can replace the jam with Pastry cream and follow the same recipe, or you can proceed with blind baking and then fill the tart with spreads.
If you prefer, you can use granulated sugar instead of whole cane sugar, but you will get a less aromatic taste.
If you don't have a stand mixer, work the dough by hand as quickly as possible to avoid forming the gluten structure.
