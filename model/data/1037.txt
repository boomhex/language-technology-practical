To prepare the ricotta and Nutella tart, start with the shortcrust pastry. In the bowl of a stand mixer, pour in the all-purpose flour , sugar , and cold butter cut into pieces .
Add the grated orange and lemon zest . Work with the paddle attachment for about 2 minutes to obtain a sandy dough. At this point, add both the egg and the yolk. Work again for a couple of minutes until you get a compact and uniform dough . Try not to overwork the dough; avoid overheating it to prevent forming gluten that would make the crust compact and not crumbly.
Transfer the dough to a work surface and form a ball. Wrap it with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. In the meantime, prepare the ricotta and Nutella cream. Pour sugar into a small bowl and add the seeds from the vanilla bean .
Then pour the ricotta into another bowl, add the sugar , and mix well with a hand whisk . When the sugar is absorbed, add the Nutella .
Mix well with a spatula until you get a uniform cream. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge until needed. Once the dough has rested, transfer it to a floured work surface and roll it out to a thickness of 1/4 inch . Roll it onto the rolling pin and gently transfer it into a 9-inch diameter pan .
Apply light pressure with your hands to ensure the dough adheres well to the pan. Use a small knife to remove excess dough from the edges . Quickly work all the dough scraps , which will be used to make the lattice. Retrieve the ricotta and Nutella cream from the fridge and use it to fill the pastry shell .
Level the surface well with a spoon . Then roll out the remaining dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch and cut strips about 3/4 inch wide . Arrange the strips on the tart, first in one direction
and then in the other . Press lightly to adhere them to the edge and use a small knife to remove the excess .
Once you have made the lattice , you can bake the tart in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 40 minutes. After this time, take it out and let it cool before removing it from the mold and serving .
The ricotta and Nutella tart can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days.
We recommend letting the tart sit at room temperature for a few minutes before serving.
