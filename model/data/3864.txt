Soft, tangy notes of Tyrolean Sauerkraut make it a super delicious addition for any family gathering or weeknight meal. There’s a big appeal in seeing that bowl of golden fermented cabbage on the table—looks really inviting next to sausage, pork, or a bowl of hearty stew. Every bite gives that signature tangy , zesty flavor kids and grown-ups seem to agree on—super good when you mix the soft feel with the bold, slightly salty taste. Whether you’re putting it next to roasted meats or trying a new kind of family dinner, the strong character of homemade sauerkraut brings so much flavor and really livens up anything else on your plate. Bringing in a few classic Bavarian touches—little bit of caraway here, gentle vinegar tang there—gives this traditional sauerkraut its one-of-a-kind charm that everyone remembers, especially around the holidays or special get-togethers. You see it and smell it, and you just know a GOOD meal’s coming.
For busy cooks, the comfort of this easy sauerkraut recipe can be a real weeknight winner (perfect pantry backup—seriously convenient when life moves fast). Families love how quickly Bavarian sauerkraut fits into dinners, cookouts, or even a school-night sausage night—it’s dependable, always tasty, and easy to dress up with caraway or a little bit more vinegar . Plain is great, but adding a little twist keeps things interesting for kids and grown-ups alike. Having fermented cabbage on hand means there’s always a healthy side dish ready to go…adds a little probiotic boost, too (good for everybody). This stuff sticks around, keeps well, and just seems to work anywhere you need some zest or that classic flavor. It’s all about easy wins at the table— rich , unique taste, perfect with meats or bread, and great for casual or festive occasions. Most home cooks would agree...keeping traditional sauerkraut handy keeps any meal tasting real, comforting, and pretty nice (sometimes exactly what a busy family needs).
Place the sauerkraut in a pot and cover them with approximately 3 1/2 cups of water; add the smoked bacon which you have cut into three slices, the meat stock cube, and the juniper berries. Cook for about 45-50 minutes over low heat, covering the pot with a lid. After the necessary time, when the sauerkraut is tender and dry enough, turn off the heat. Chop the onion and let it soften with the oil and butter, then add two level tablespoons of flour, mix, and let it brown for a few minutes, then pour the contents over the sauerkraut. Put the pot with the sauerkraut back on low heat, stir for a moment to combine, then turn off the heat and serve the sauerkraut still hot.
If before cooking the sauerkraut you realize, by tasting them, that they are too sour, immerse them for a few minutes in plenty of cold water, massaging them with your hands, then drain them well, squeeze them out, and proceed with the recipe.
