instructions:
To prepare the liquid pizza in air fryer, pour the flour into a bowl along with the salt and instant yeast . Add the water gradually .
Gradually incorporate the water while stirring with a whisk . Lastly, add the oil and mix to combine and obtain a homogeneous mixture . You should achieve a thick batter.
Grease a pan with oil with a diameter of 8 inches and pour the batter inside . Place the pan in the air fryer (we used a fryer with a capacity of 6 liters) and cook at 392°F for 5 minutes .
In the meantime, prepare the topping: pour the peeled tomatoes into a bowl and season with oil , salt, and oregano , then mash and mix with a fork .
After the 5 minutes of cooking, top the pizza with the tomato , shredded mozzarella by hand , and oregano .
Finish with a drizzle of oil and cook for another 8 minutes, still at 392°F. Once cooked , your liquid pizza in air fryer is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the liquid pizza in air fryer as soon as it's ready.
You can freeze it after cooking or store it in the refrigerator for one day.
If you need to prepare more pizzas, proceed with the first cooking for all, then top them and finish cooking before serving.
