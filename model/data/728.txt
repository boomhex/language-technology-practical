instructions:
To prepare breaded slices, first pound them if they are too thick . Then pass them first in flour and then in previously beaten eggs .
Finally, pass them in breadcrumbs . Between each step, always be sure to shake them to remove excess. Continue this way until all 4 slices are breaded and transfer them to a plate as you go . At this point, pour the clarified butter into a large skillet .
When the butter is well melted and hot, immerse the first slice . Let it brown for 2-3 minutes, then turn it using tongs and wait another 2-3 minutes. Drain it and transfer it to a tray with paper towels to remove excess fat . Salt and serve your breaded slices while still hot!
If you're looking for a tasty side dish, try our buttered potatoes. Wash and cut the new potatoes in half . In a skillet, pour the butter and aromatic herbs, let it melt, then add the potatoes . Cook gently for about twenty minutes, stirring occasionally; add salt and pepper to taste. Serve the buttered potatoes with our breaded slices .
You can bread the slices a little in advance and store them in the refrigerator. If you prefer, you can also freeze them by wrapping them separately in plastic wrap.
Once cooked, we recommend consuming the breaded slices immediately. You can also store them in the fridge for a day and then reheat them, but they might not be as tender as when freshly made!
Clarified butter has a higher smoke point, allowing you to reach higher temperatures without burning, ensuring your cutlet is always well browned. If you can't find clarified butter, you can use oil instead. Both extra virgin and seed oil are fine. Alternatively, you can mix them.
It's always better to cook meat at room temperature to prevent the cold from storage from lowering the cooking base temperature too much: in this case, the breading might separate.
