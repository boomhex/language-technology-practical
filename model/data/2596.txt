Add the sifted flour and baking powder, one tablespoon at a time ,
salt , and finally the softened butter, one piece at a time , waiting for the previous piece to be absorbed before adding another. When the batter is smooth and homogeneous, turn off the mixer. Divide the mixture into two bowls (about 14 oz each)
In one bowl, add the pistachio paste , milk , and 1.75 oz of chocolate chips , gently mix with a spatula to combine the mixture
In the other bowl with the batter, add the orange juice , grated zest , and chocolate chips
and potato starch . Mix gently and then pour the two mixtures into two piping bags without nozzles. Then place these two bags into a larger bag that can contain them , butter and line with parchment paper a loaf pan of 11 x 4.5 inches, fill the mold by squeezing the two mixtures, you will get a two-color batter .
When you have finished squeezing the two batters , bake the plumcake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 60 minutes (or in a fan oven at 300°F for 50 minutes). Once baked, remove from the oven and let it cool slightly, then unmold onto a wire rack and let it cool completely. Prepare the ganache: chop the dark chocolate
heat the cream in a saucepan until it reaches a boil, and pour in the chopped chocolate . Stir to melt the chocolate and obtain a smooth cream . Pour the ganache over the plumcake, being careful to place a plate under the rack to collect the excess cream .
