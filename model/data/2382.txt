To prepare the mezze rigatoni with artichoke cream and scampi, start by How to clean artichokes . Remove the outermost leaves and cut off the tip of your artichokes . Then cut them in half and remove the inner choke, using a small knife.
Cut each artichoke half into slices and set them aside (to prevent them from turning brown, you can put them in a bowl with cold water and lemon juice). Finely chop the red onion and cut the potatoes into cubes of about 0.4 inches .
Pour the olive oil into a pan and add the onion , let it wilt slightly and also add the artichoke strips . Stir everything and deglaze with the white wine .
Add a ladle of hot water , and season with salt and pepper. Also add the potatoes and cover again with a ladle of hot water .
Cook over high heat for 10-15 minutes, adding more water if needed . At this point, transfer the sauce into a blender cup and blend until you obtain a homogeneous and rather smooth cream .
Take your scampi and wash them under running water, then with the help of scissors, cut the belly of the scampi halfway . Finely chop the parsley and cook your mezze rigatoni in plenty of boiling water, salted to taste .
Meanwhile, as the pasta cooks, heat 3 tbsps of oil with a clove of garlic in a large pan, when the garlic is slightly golden remove it and add the scampi. Deglaze with the brandy and let it cook for about 4 minutes over high heat, then sprinkle with parsley , cover with a lid and turn off the heat.
Meanwhile, pour your artichoke cream into a pan, drain the pasta al dente and add it to the artichoke cream , mixing well . Plate and finally add the scampi .
Store the mezze rigatoni with artichoke cream and scampi in the fridge for up to 1 day, in a sealed container.
Try replacing the scampi with shrimp or prawns.
