Whether you call them homemade pasta decorations or just a fun Christmas meal, these pasta trees always bring out the holiday spirit. And, frankly, they make family time even more special. Can't go wrong with the tradition and joy these really good creations bring to your holiday table.
To prepare the pasta tree, bring a pot full of water to a boil for the pasta, add salt and bring to a boil. Then, bring another small pot of water to a boil (you'll need it to briefly blanch the peas for decoration). Take the slices of ham and cut 3.5 oz (100 g) into strips ; then chop it coarsely with a knife. In a large enough pan, heat a drizzle of oil and briefly sauté the ham . After a few moments, add the tomato sauce .
Add 2.1 oz (60 g) of peas as well. Salt and season with thyme leaves; cook the sauce for about 5 minutes . In a separate pot, briefly blanch the remaining 0.7 oz (20 g) of peas, then drain and set aside .
Now move on to the Béchamel sauce : heat the milk in a pot , and as soon as it reaches a boil, turn off the heat and keep warm. In another pot, melt the butter over very low heat, and when it’s completely melted, add the flour and immediately stir with a whisk to prevent lumps .
Once the roux is made, pour in the hot milk and continue to stir with the whisk until it thickens . The consistency should be quite fluid, and the béchamel should not be too dense. Season the béchamel with salt and grated nutmeg .
Cook the pasta for the time indicated on the package and drain it directly into the pan where you cooked the sauce . Mix thoroughly ; grease the bottom of a low-sided baking dish with oil, measuring approximately 15x10 in (38x25 cm) .
Sprinkle with breadcrumbs, covering the entire surface . Pour the pasta into it, spread it well throughout the dish using the back of a spoon , and sprinkle with scattered spoonfuls of béchamel. Place the pasta in a preheated static oven at 390°F (200°C) for about 5 minutes .
After the indicated time, remove from the oven and let the pasta cool slightly: then start cutting it into squares, cut each in half to obtain two triangles, which will be your trees. Decorate your trees with the peas you set aside , placing them as if they were tree ornaments. Cut 1.8 oz (50 g) of the reserved ham into strips and place 2-3 on the tree as decorative garlands . Serve your pasta trees !
It is recommended to consume the pasta trees immediately; alternatively, they can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day.
Make the sauce with zucchini and replace the ham with speck.
