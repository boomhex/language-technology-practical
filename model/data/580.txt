Cut the lard into pieces and also the water chestnuts . Place everything in a food processor .
Add the shrimp as well and blend finely to obtain a homogeneous mixture . Transfer the filling to a bowl and season with salt, pepper, and rice wine . Mix and let it rest for 10 minutes .
For the dough: in a bowl pour the flour, lukewarm water in the center, and a pinch of salt , mix and then, when the dough starts to come together, transfer it to a work surface .
Form a smooth dough ball, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rest for 30 minutes . Roll out the dough first with a rolling pin , then pass it through a pasta machine to create a very thin sheet.
Use a glass or a pastry cutter with a 3-inch diameter to cut out circular discs . Place a tablespoon of filling in the center of the dough disc . Fold the edges using the tip of a knife .
So that they resemble a flower . Garnish the top by dipping the top of the dumpling into a bowl of grated carrots . Place a pea in the center .
Take a steaming basket, place a cabbage leaf on top to prevent the dumplings from sticking . Place the dumplings inside , cover with the lid, and cook for 10-12 minutes over medium heat. The Shao Mai dumplings are ready to be enjoyed .
Cooked dumplings can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days in an airtight container.
The raw dough discs can be stacked, well floured, and frozen in a bag. It is advisable to defrost them for at least 1 hour or 1 hour and a half before use, at room temperature.
Once filled, the dumplings can be frozen separately on a floured tray; once they are hardened, they can be stored in the freezer in a bag. You can cook them directly from frozen, maybe for a few minutes longer. In this case, it is preferable to proceed with boiling rather than steaming.
Rice wine can be replaced with the same amount of white table wine.
Instead of a steamer, you can cook the dumplings in a double boiler.
For cooking, instead of cabbage, you can line the bottom of the steamer with perforated parchment paper.
Water chestnuts are available canned in oriental food stores; if you cannot find them, you can replace them with radishes.
