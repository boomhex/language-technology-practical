instructions:
To prepare the Easter chocolate egg bundt cake , first crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them quickly. Add the vanilla extract , the sugar , and work with the electric whisk for about 5 minutes until you get an airy mixture .
While continuing to beat, pour in the vegetable oil and the milk gradually. Now add the sifted flour .
Also add the sifted baking powder , a pinch of salt, and incorporate the powders with a spatula, mixing gently from bottom to top. Lastly, coarsely chop the Easter egg chocolate and mix it in the same way to blend evenly .
Butter and flour a fluted pan with a diameter of 9.5 inches at the top and 8 inches at the base, pour in the mixture and level the surface . Bake in a static oven at 356°F for about 45 minutes. Before removing from the oven, check the baking with a toothpick, then let it cool in the pan. After unmolding, your Easter chocolate egg bundt cake is ready to be served , perhaps with a dusting of powdered sugar!
The Easter chocolate egg bundt cake can be stored at room temperature, under a glass dome or well covered with plastic wrap, for about 3-4 days.
If you like, you can flavor the batter with cinnamon, orange zest, or lemon zest. You can also enrich it with chopped nuts, like walnuts, almonds, or hazelnuts.
For an even more indulgent version, you can glaze the Easter egg bundt cake with melted chocolate and decorate it with colorful sprinkles!
