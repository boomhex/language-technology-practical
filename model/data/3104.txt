So here's the deal: when you're planning your next holiday gathering, think about these charming little mice to bring smiles to everyone’s faces and add a unique touch to your celebration.
To prepare the egg mice, place the eggs in a saucepan with water over medium heat . As soon as the water reaches a boil, let them cook for 8 minutes. Cool them under cold water, then peel them gently, being careful not to damage the smooth surface of the egg . Cut the eggs in half lengthwise .
Wash and clean the radishes and cut them into thin slices . Use a small knife to remove the lateral parts, forming a triangle with a rounded base . Make cuts in the egg where you will position the radish slices to form the ears .
With a toothpick, make a hole in the center of the egg and insert a piece of olive, thus forming the nose . Slightly above, make two small holes and insert two smaller pieces of olive than the nose; these will be the eyes . Now form the tail of your mouse, making a small hole with the toothpick and then inserting a chive stem .
Take some rosemary needles and insert them on the sides of the nose to form the mouse's whiskers . Your mouse is ready, repeat the same procedure for the remaining eggs. Once the mice are finished, you just need to prepare the pink sauce by mixing mayonnaise with ketchup until you get a smooth and uniform sauce . Now place the mice on a bed of lettuce and serve them accompanied by the pink sauce .
Egg mice can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Radishes are a bit tricky... Beautiful, in this case, but a bit tricky. If you don't like them, a valid alternative for the mouse ears is carrots. They are more challenging aesthetically but still suitable! Eggs, however, are irreplaceable as they must be very fresh; otherwise, when peeling, the surface will not remain smooth, and you'll lose the shiny effect that makes the mice special.
