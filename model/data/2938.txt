Schiacciate con nduja e olive nere infornate is the kind of snack that’ll really wake up your taste buds with each crispy bite. This spicy flatbread recipe comes straight from Calabria, a region in southern Italy known for foods that seriously pack a punch. And let’s be honest, the real star here is 'nduja —a spicy, spreadable salami loaded with Calabrian chili peppers. It’s got that bold, tangy kick that just hits way way differently compared to other Italian meats. Spread it over the flatbread and, boom, it turns into a super hard to resist Italian flatbread with 'nduja . Add some oven-baked black olives, and you get these cool bursts of salty flavor that balance out the heat—plus, the color combo looks as good as it tastes. People often go with Gaeta olives for a milder touch, but you know, the classic Calabrian way uses whatever black olives you can find, letting those Mediterranean flavors really really shine.
Bite into one of these, and you’ll notice how the golden, almost crunchy outside gives way to a slightly moist and chewy center, with the spicy sausage just melting in. The folks in Calabria enjoy these as an easy 'nduja appetizer at parties or as a quick snack when friends come over. And you get all the heat and smokiness from the sausage and a kind of earthy sweetness from the olives. Not fancy food, just simple stuff that tastes amazing—especially when served warm right out of the oven. What makes this baked flatbread with olives stand out is how it uses just a few ingredients—no complicated steps, just good flavors put together in a way that’s pretty hard to resist.
If you love strong taste and snacks with a little edge, this Calabrian 'nduja flatbread is the kind of thing that’ll disappear fast at any gathering. It’s like having the taste of southern Italy on a plate. Perfect for anyone who enjoys their food with a bit of a spicy kick and a whole lot of character. Whether you’re hosting a party or just craving a tasty snack, this dish is sure to be a hit.
