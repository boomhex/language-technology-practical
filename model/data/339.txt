instructions:
To prepare air fryer boiled eggs, first preheat the fryer to 266°F (we used a fryer with a capacity of 6 liters). Then place the eggs in the basket and cook for 15 minutes. Remove the eggs and cool them in cold water or alternatively in water and ice. Once cold, tap the top and bottom .
Roll them on the countertop applying light pressure, so as to crack the shell in multiple places. Then gently peel them with your hands . Cut them in half, plate, and season with oil, salt, and pepper. Your air fryer boiled eggs are ready to be enjoyed .
Air fryer boiled eggs can be stored in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for 2 days.
You can cook eggs in the air fryer to make a variety of dishes, to enrich a baked pasta or rice salad. They can be stuffed in many different ways, for example with a yolk and mayonnaise cream, enriched with spices like paprika or curry. Alternatively, transform them into "deviled eggs" by mixing the yolks with mustard, vinegar, and pepper. You can also garnish with fresh herbs, like parsley or chives, or serve them with a yogurt and lime sauce for a fresh touch. If you prefer a smoky flavor, you can add crispy ham or crumbled bacon.
