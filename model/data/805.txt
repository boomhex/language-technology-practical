instructions:
To prepare the tasty artichoke pasta, you must first chop the carrots and onions . Once done, cut the bacon into strips and set it aside. Now clean the artichokes: remove the outer leaves until you reach the lighter ones inside, then cut off the artichoke tip, removing all thorns present at the tip of the leaves. Cut the stem, leaving a few inches, and peel it with a peeler .
Cut the artichokes into quarters and remove the inner fluff . Gradually transfer the artichokes into acidulated water to prevent them from turning brown. Once all the artichokes are finished, brown the bacon strips in a nice large pan . In the meantime, put a pot full of water on the stove and bring it to a boil for cooking the pasta.
When the bacon is well browned, remove it from the pan and transfer it to a small bowl . Pour a drizzle of oil into the same pan and the chopped vegetables . Sauté for 5 minutes.
When the vegetables start to soften, add the artichokes , season with salt , and let them wilt over a rather high flame for another 6-7 minutes. By now the water will have reached a boil, add salt and dip the pasta , which should be cooked al dente.
Then drain the pasta, transfer it to the pan with the artichokes, and mix well . Add a ladle of cooking water if necessary and add the crispy bacon . Serve your tasty artichoke pasta, adding grated Parmesan.
We recommend serving the tasty artichoke pasta immediately.
