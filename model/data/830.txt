instructions:
To prepare the gnocchi with friggitelli and sausage, first wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them in half . Clean the friggitelli by removing the seeds and internal filaments , then slice them into rings . Put a pot of water on the stove and bring it to a boil for cooking the gnocchi.
In a pan, flavor the oil with a clove of garlic , then add the sausage and sauté over high heat for a few minutes . Set the sausage aside, making sure to retain the cooking juices.
In the same pan, pour in the cherry tomatoes and friggitelli , season with basil leaves, and adjust with salt and pepper .
Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, then remove the garlic and reduce the heat to low. At this point, the water should be boiling, so cook the gnocchi for the time indicated on the package . Meanwhile, add the sautéed sausage to the cherry tomatoes and friggitelli in the pan .
After the cooking time, drain the gnocchi directly into the pan and toss everything for a few seconds, mixing with a ladle of the cooking water . Grate spicy provolone to taste and serve your gnocchi with friggitelli and sausage!
The gnocchi with friggitelli and sausage can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
As an alternative to friggitelli, you can use bell peppers.
If you prefer, you can replace the gnocchi with pasta... the result will be just as delicious!
