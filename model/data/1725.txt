instructions:
To prepare the seafood cone with mojito mayo, start by making the latter. In the bowl of a mixer, pour the oil, soy milk , salt, then grate the lime zest and squeeze the juice of half of it .
Add the rum and create a thick cream using an immersion blender . Transfer it into a bowl, add the mint that you have finely chopped with a knife .
Mix and set aside in the refrigerator . Meanwhile, rinse the seafood well, preferably individually, including mullets , shrimps ,
and finally the calamari rings . Arrange them on a tray . Heat a generous amount of oil to 375°F in a pot and meanwhile flour the mullets in semolina .
Gradually dip 5-6 pieces at a time and let them brown for a couple of minutes . Then immediately proceed by flouring the shrimps and dipping them in the oil .
And then for the calamari rings (16-17). Stir occasionally using a slotted spoon
and then drain them as soon as they start to brown . Drain on absorbent paper and proceed until you finish the ingredients . Arrange in paper cones and the mock mayonnaise in small bowls: the seafood cone with mojito mayo is ready, serve very hot !
Once cooked, the seafood is best consumed immediately; it can also be stored for a couple of days in the fridge but the texture will be very different. The mayo can be safely stored for 4-5 days in a covered glass container.
You can omit the rum in the mayo if you don't like it, replace it with a bit more lime juice. For a gluten-free version, you can flour the seafood with rice flour.
