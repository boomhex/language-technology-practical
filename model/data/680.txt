instructions:
To prepare the fennel cordon bleu, start by cleaning the fennel: remove the green part and slice them horizontally to obtain 4 pairs of slices of roughly the same thickness . Also cut the Edam cheese into regular slices. Place a slice of ham on a fennel disc .
Add a layer of cheese and close with another slice of fennel. Dip the whole thing first in flour and then in eggs beaten with milk .


Pass the cordon bleu again in the flour and in the eggs , and finally cover it with breadcrumbs .

Mold it with your hands to keep the shape and place the cordon bleu on a tray lined with parchment paper. Continue in this way to make all the others; with these quantities, you will get 4 . Prepare the accompanying salad: remove the first leaves from the radicchio and take the base , then cut in half and into as many wedges as you can get .
Prepare an emulsion of oil, balsamic vinegar, thyme leaves, salt, and pepper . Season the radicchio with the emulsion . Chop the walnuts .

Toast the walnuts in a pan , then add them to the salad and mix .
Fry the fennel cordon bleu, no more than 2 at a time, in deep oil at 340°F . After a couple of minutes, they will be golden brown, so drain them and serve them with the accompanying salad !
It is recommended to consume the fennel cordon bleu immediately.
The double pass in flour and eggs will prevent the filling from spilling out. The filling can be changed to your liking, the important thing is to use stringy cheeses without whey (provolone and scamorza are recommended).
To prevent the cordon bleu from burning at the bottom, make sure to keep them resting on the skimmer throughout cooking.
To ensure a melting effect, it is better to keep the cheese and other ingredients cold from the fridge before starting, so they will all be at the right temperature.
The Edam is quite savory and, together with the cooked ham, will give the right kick even though no salt is ever added in the recipe: if you prefer, you can still add a pinch of salt on the surface at the end!
