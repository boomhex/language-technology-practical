instructions:
To prepare the quick apricot tarte tatin, cut the apricots in half and remove the pit . Make the caramel: place the water in a small saucepan .
Add the sugar and let the caramel form, heating over medium and consistent flame , making sure it takes on a nice dark color (without burning it). When it's ready, turn off the heat and add the butter cubes at room temperature .
Mix well with the whisk until combined . Pour half of the caramel into each of the two 6.5-inch diameter pans , arrange the apricots face down, pressing them well into the caramel .
You should be able to fit about 10 halves per pan . From the rectangular pastry, cut two 6.5-inch discs. Place a pastry over the apricots and press it well into the edges with your fingers. Prick with a fork and bake at 350°F for about 35 minutes.
Once baked, let it cool at room temperature for about half an hour so that the caramel sets a little . Meanwhile, toast the almonds in a pan . Unmold the slightly cooled tarte tatin onto a cutting board .
Plate it and serve it with toasted almond slivers and marjoram leaves. The quick apricot tarte tatin is ready to be enjoyed .
We recommend consuming the quick apricot tarte tatin as soon as it is prepared; alternatively, it can be stored for one day but will be less crisp. Freezing is not recommended.
You can make the quick tarte tatin in a single 9.5-inch diameter pan; in this case, you will need a 230g round pastry.
