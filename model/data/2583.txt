instructions:
Lasagne al verde is such a tasty dish, really really something special. And here's the thing, it all comes to life when Italian cooks by the beautiful coast decide to shake things up. Instead of your usual red sauce and meat, you get a fresh take with lasagne al verde . This one features thin green pasta sheets made with rocket pesto. Seriously good. The herby, bright flavor of pesto di rucola is the first thing you notice, giving each bite a punch that's both fresh and a little peppery. Down in Liguria or Campania, where seafood's everywhere, this twist just fits. People love how the tender pasta picks up all those complex, aromatic notes from the pesto and the sauce, turning a classic into something really new. It's lighter than your usual baked pasta. Plus, it looks awesome on the table with that green color just popping through every layer.
Nothing about this lasagne di mare is ordinary. Nope. The real surprise? The ragù di polpo . It's a sauce made with tender, slow-cooked octopus instead of beef or pork. And listen, it has this delicate seafood taste that soaks right into the soft pasta, mixing perfectly with the fresh herbs from the pesto di rucola . This isn’t your grandma’s lasagna, but it really respects the old-school Italian love of good ingredients and bold ideas. Pretty much. Coastal folks have been adding seafood to their pasta al forno forever, you know, but the way the flavors in this dish blend together is just something special. You end up with a meal that's both refined and a bit adventurous. When you’re looking for a step up from the usual ricette di pesce, this is the pick. Imagine long tables by the sea, lots of laughter, and good wine. For real, give this moist and savory twist on cucina italiana tradizionale a try when you're up for some real Italian inspiration. It's a dish that captures the heart of coastal Italy, combining innovative flavors with a nod to tradition. Can't go wrong.
To make the green lasagna with arugula pesto and octopus ragout, start with cooking the octopus: begin by rinsing it under running water , then use a knife to remove the eyes and beak , remove the innards and rinse well under running water to clean the sack. Now that the octopus is clean, you can proceed with cooking. Take a large pot with high sides, fill it with water, and bring it to a boil. Then immerse the octopus in the pot and cook it for about 40 minutes.
When it's ready , drain it and let it cool slightly. In the meantime, prepare the arugula pesto: wash the arugula well , dry it, and place it in a food processor bowl with blades
add the Parmesan, Pecorino , pine nuts, garlic clove, and a tablespoon of olive oil . Start blending everything at low speed and gradually add the remaining olive oil in a thin stream until you obtain a well-blended and fluid cream which you will set aside.
Wash and peel the carrot, celery, and spring onion and chop them for the sauté , place a pan on the stove, add the sauté, season with salt , and let it soften with a drizzle of olive oil for at least 10 minutes over low heat. Meanwhile, cut the octopus into pieces
add it to the softened sauté , deglaze with the white wine , allow it to evaporate and flavor the octopus for 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and season with freshly chopped parsley .
Now you can assemble the lasagna: take a 8x12 inch baking dish, spread a layer of arugula pesto on the bottom , then take the pasta sheets, place 3 on the bottom , season with more arugula pesto and make a layer with the octopus ragout ,
then cover with another 3 layers of sheets and season again with pesto and ragout, continue by placing 4 layers of sheets in the other direction , cover them again with pesto and octopus, and finish with a final layer of 4 sheets
similar to the previous one, finish the pesto and ragout seasoning and flavor with grated Grana cheese . Cook the lasagna in a static oven preheated to 430°F for 20 minutes (or in a fan oven at 390°F for 10 minutes). Once cooked, take your green lasagna with arugula pesto and octopus ragout out of the oven , let it cool for a few minutes and then serve it at the table.
You can store the green lasagna with arugula pesto and octopus ragout in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container for 1-2 days. They can be prepared the day before, kept in the fridge covered with plastic wrap, and cooked the next day. It's possible to freeze them, only if all fresh ingredients have been used, preferably when raw: to cook them, it will be sufficient to thaw them in the refrigerator about 24 hours before and then cook them in the oven.
For seafood lovers, it will be easy to try many other tasty variations of this lasagna: for example with swordfish ragout, monkfish, or even cuttlefish.
