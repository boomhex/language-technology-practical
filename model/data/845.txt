instructions:
To prepare the rice ring filled with eggplants, first start making the risotto. Pour a drizzle of oil into a saucepan , add the rice , and toast it for a few minutes .
Then add the tomato sauce , salt, pepper, and the first 1 1/4 cups of water . Cover with a lid and cook for 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding more water as needed. Once cooked, turn off the heat .
Flavor the rice with grated Grana cheese , mix , then pour the rice into a bowl and let it cool at room temperature for 1 hour .
Meanwhile, wash the eggplant, trim it, and slice it about 1/4 inch thick with a mandoline . Pour the vegetable oil into a pan and heat it until it reaches a temperature of 340°F. Then dip a few slices of eggplant and fry them for a few minutes until they are golden brown. Then drain them, transfer them onto a paper towel , and continue cooking the others.
Then cut the caciocavallo cheese into cubes and set aside. At this point, oil the bottom of a bundt pan about 3 1/2 inches high, with a diameter of about 8 inches at the top and 9 inches at the base, then coat it with breadcrumbs. This way, you won't have difficulty unmolding the ring. Pour about half of the rice inside , compacting well with a spoon. Then place half of the fried eggplants in the center of the rice ,
the caciocavallo cubes , and the other fried eggplants on top . Cover everything with the remaining rice .
Compact well with the back of the spoon . Bake in a preheated static oven at 400°F for about 25 minutes. Then remove the ring from the oven and let it rest for about 15 minutes before turning it onto a serving plate .
Garnish the rice ring filled with eggplants by grating 1 oz of caciocavallo cheese on top , a sprinkle of pepper, and fresh basil leaves .
The rice ring filled with eggplants can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of 2-3 days. You can freeze the ring in convenient pre-portioned slices!
Add fresh basil, chili pepper, and for an even tastier variant, add tuna fillets or swordfish cubes to your risotto.
