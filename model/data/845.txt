To prepare the gourmet Easter egg, the first thing you will need to do is temper the chocolate. Equip yourself with a thermometer and proceed to melt the chocolate. You can choose whether to do it in the microwave or with the bain-marie method we show you. Place a pot of water on the stove and place a bowl over it . The water should not boil too much, otherwise, as it evaporates, it can fall into the chocolate. Then pour the chocolate chips, or coarsely chopped chocolate, inside and stir until melted .
Using a thermometer, check that it has reached a temperature between 122°F and 131°F . At this point, carefully dry the bottom of the bowl and transfer the chocolate onto a clean and perfectly dry marble surface . With the help of 2 spatulas, spread the chocolate on the marble , spreading it and gathering it back to the center to cool the cocoa butter.
You will notice that gradually the chocolate will become shiny and thicker. Occasionally measure the temperature and as soon as it reaches 84°F, transfer it into a bowl using the two spatulas . Stir the chocolate and heat it again in the microwave or bain-marie, until it reaches a temperature of 88°F . The chocolate is now tempered.
Transfer the tempered chocolate into the 2 Easter egg molds, which you will have cleaned carefully, filling the first and second cavity up to 2/3 of the edge of the mold. Gently jiggle the mold to cover every part and wait about 45 seconds.
Now turn the mold upside down to allow the excess chocolate to escape : you can collect it on a tray and reuse it. Then leave the mold upside down on a rack for a few more seconds to let the excess chocolate drip off . Now embellish the inside of the egg by adding candied orange cubes .
Add a grating of tonka bean and a pinch of sweet Cervia salt . Finish with caramelized hazelnut flour .
Trim the edges with a spatula . Turn the mold, always placing it on the rack , and transfer it to the fridge for 5-10 minutes. Then let it crystallize at room temperature. When the mold appears completely matte, it means the chocolate is well crystallized .
Simply lift it gently to extract the two halves . Heat a tray in the oven to 176°F. Take one of the halves and briefly place it on the tray to decrystallize part of the shell .
In this way, you can join it to the second shell , so the melted chocolate on the edges will cool and keep them attached. Place it inside a bowl and wait for it to solidify well before proceeding. For an original decoration, you can take a sponge and grate the surface of the egg to stripe it .
Perform this operation decisively but gently . Now decrystallize the base of the egg on the tray, as done before, and place it on a chocolate block, so it will stand upright . The gourmet Easter egg is ready, if you prefer you can decorate it with food coloring and chocolate inserts .
The gourmet Easter egg can be stored until the expiration date of the chocolate.
Use quality dark chocolate, preferably couverture, to obtain a perfect egg!
With the excess chocolate, you can make chocolates or Puffed Rice and Chocolate Bars . Alternatively, you can also store it in a bowl and retemper it later.
If you prefer to make just one gourmet Easter egg, you will only need to temper 500 g of chocolate.
