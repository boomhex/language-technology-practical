To make the cannelloni with broccoli cream, ricotta, and spiced ragù, start by preparing the ragù: peel the onion, carrot, and celery, then finely chop them for the soffritto (1-2-3).
Sauté the chopped vegetables in a pan with a drizzle of olive oil, salt , flavor with bay leaves and let the soffritto wilt for at least 10 minutes over low heat. Add the ground pork to the soffritto and stir with a wooden spoon to break it into crumbs and let it brown for a few minutes,
then deglaze with white wine , continue cooking for 20 minutes over moderate heat, then flavor with a teaspoon of sweet paprika , chop the fennel seeds with a mezzaluna and add them to the rest of the ingredients , stir to flavor the ragù and set aside.
Now take care of the broccoli: separate the florets from the central stem, then cut the florets in half , in a pan sauté the garlic with a drizzle of oil, just long enough to flavor the oil, then remove the garlic and add the broccoli, salt, pepper, and sauté for 5 minutes, then pour a ladle of water
continue cooking with the lid on for 15 minutes until the broccoli is tender . Separately, sift the ricotta to make it creamier , salt, pepper,
pour in the milk in a thin stream and stir with a whisk, then flavor with grated nutmeg . Place the now cooled broccoli in a bowl, being careful to set aside 2 oz, mash them with a fork
incorporate them into the ragù (do not use all the ragù but set aside 10 oz to dress the cannelloni) and into the ricotta cream , also in this case set aside 7 oz of ricotta for the dressing). Mix the ingredients to obtain a soft mixture and set aside for filling . Take an 8x12 inch baking dish, spread half of the ricotta cream on the bottom
and half of the ragù set aside , take the cannelloni and the filling and pour it into a piping bag without a nozzle to help you fill the cannelloni , place the filled cannelloni in the baking dish
and cover them with the remaining ricotta cream (if you want, you can use a piping bag to make it easier) , finish with a final layer of ragù and broccoli, sprinkle the surface with grated Grana Padano cheese . Bake in a static oven at 375°F for 35 minutes plus 5 minutes with the grill (if using a convection oven, bake at 340°F for 25 minutes). Once cooking is complete, remove the cannelloni with broccoli cream, ricotta, and spiced white pork ragù from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving.
You can store the cannelloni with broccoli cream, ricotta, and spiced white pork ragù in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container for 1-2 days. They can be prepared the day before, kept in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap, and baked the next day. It is possible to freeze them, only if all fresh ingredients have been used, preferably raw: to cook them, simply defrost them in the refrigerator about 24 hours before and then bake.
As an alternative to pork, you can opt for beef or a mixed ground meat. If you love stronger flavors, you can use sheep's milk ricotta.
