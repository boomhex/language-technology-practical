instructions:
Wash the potatoes and boil them in salted water along with a clove of unpeeled garlic, cooking for about 30/35 minutes (the cooking time depends on the size of the potatoes). Drain them and after peeling them with a knife, let them cool and slice them to about 1/2 inch thick . If the slices are too large to be eaten in one bite, cut them in half. Set aside the garlic, which you will use to prepare the dressing. Wash the cucumber and slice it into rounds keeping the skin on.
Slice the red onion into very thin pieces using a mandoline or a sharp knife. In a blender, add the extra virgin olive oil, lukewarm water, lemon juice, honey, mustard, and the garlic clove peeled and crushed with a spoon until you obtain a puree. Blend for about two minutes and adjust with salt and pepper, regulating the consistency of the dressing by adding more oil or lukewarm water. Arrange the potato slices on a plate with the cucumbers .
Drain and chop the sun-dried tomatoes and sprinkle the strips over the potato and cucumber salad . Add some rings of red onion , and the black olives .
Dress with the dressing ensuring to coat the potatoes well. Finally, finish by adding the crumbled feta cheese and oregano . Serve the potato and cucumber salad immediately or store it in the refrigerator until it's time to enjoy it.
