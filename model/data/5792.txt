instructions:
To prepare the chocolate coffee fudge, start by lining an 8-inch (20 cm) square container with baking paper.
Chop the dark chocolate with a knife and place it in a bowl; add 1/2 oz of butter (15 g), cut into pieces.
Melt the chocolate and butter in a bain-marie, stirring constantly until fully melted.
Stir in 6 oz (170 g) of condensed milk, creating a rather thick mixture. Pour this over the paper-lined container, level it with a spatula, and set it aside.
In a small bowl, dissolve instant coffee in hot water, and set it aside.
Chop the white chocolate, place it in a bowl, add the remaining 1/2 oz (15 g) of butter, and melt in a bain-marie, mixing carefully. When the chocolate and butter are fully melted, add the coffee mixture and mix well to combine everything.
Pour in the remaining condensed milk (7 oz - 200 g) and mix immediately until the mixture is fairly thick. Spread this over the set dark chocolate layer, leveling it well with a spatula.
Let the chocolate coffee fudge chill in the refrigerator for around 2 hours. Once firm, cut it into 1.5-inch (4 cm) cubes after removing it from the mold.
Your chocolate and coffee fudge is now ready to be savored.
Keep the fudge refrigerated for 3-4 days. Remember to take it out 10 minutes before serving for the best taste.
If you have a microwave, it's a quick alternative for melting chocolate. Use microwave-safe bowls, melt at maximum power for 30 seconds, mix well, and return the chocolate to the microwave for 10 seconds. Repeat this process 3 or 4 times until the chocolate is completely melted.
