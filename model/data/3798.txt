To prepare the coffee cream and ricotta dessert, soak the gelatin sheets in some cold water for at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, place the ricotta, cream, powdered sugar , seeds from 1 vanilla bean, two tablespoons of concentrated espresso
and the coffee powder into a blender, then blend everything for a few minutes until you obtain a creamy mixture . Pour the obtained mixture into a saucepan, place it on low heat, and slowly warm it up .
Once at temperature, drain and squeeze the gelatin sheets very well, then add them to the mixture and stir until completely dissolved (this will take a few minutes). Turn off the heat and pour the mixture into semifreddo molds . Let the mixture cool well in the molds and then transfer them to the refrigerator for at least 3-4 hours. Half an hour before serving the semifreddos, prepare the coffee caramel: put the sugar in a heavy-bottomed saucepan, and melt it completely over low heat ,
until it reaches an amber color . At this point, incorporate 3 oz of espresso , still over low heat, and continue to stir to combine everything. Once you've achieved a smooth and fluid mixture, turn off the heat and let it cool, stirring occasionally. When your semifreddos are ready, remove them from the refrigerator and, to make it easier to extract them from the molds, dip them in hot water for a few seconds, then invert them onto a serving plate and remove them. Finally, garnish the desserts with coffee caramel and, if desired, with some roasted coffee beans (or, if you find them, chocolate coffee beans) .
Store the coffee cream and ricotta dessert in the refrigerator, sealed in an airtight container, for up to 3 days. It cannot be frozen.
You can serve the coffee cream and ricotta dessert with coffee beans or chocolate-covered coffee beans. Alternatively, you can use curls of dark or gianduia chocolate.
