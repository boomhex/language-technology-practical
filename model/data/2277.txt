To prepare fusilli with cream, ham, and peas, start by placing a pot filled with slightly salted water on the stove for cooking the pasta. Take the cooked ham and cut it first into slices and then into cubes of about 1 inch . Then finely chop the onion and place it in a saucepan where you have added the oil ; let it sauté for a few minutes over medium heat, then add the peas .
Add a ladle of pasta cooking water and let it cook for about 15 minutes on high heat. At this point, also add the cooked ham and sauté everything together for 2-3 minutes. Add the cream ,
stir and let it cook on low heat for a couple of minutes . Meanwhile, cook the pasta
and drain it al dente, pouring it directly into the sauce . Mix everything to blend the flavors and serve your fusilli with cream and ham while still hot!
Fusilli with cream, ham, and peas can be stored in an airtight container for up to one day in the refrigerator.
By cooking the peas for only 15 minutes, you will achieve the right consistency and keep their bright and vibrant color. To enhance the flavor of the dish, try adding a sprinkle of Grana cheese!
