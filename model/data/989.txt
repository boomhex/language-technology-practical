instructions:
To prepare the zucchini in batter, start with the zucchini. After washing and drying them, remove the ends and slice them rather thinly . Place them in a colander and sprinkle with salt: let them rest for 30 minutes, this way they will lose some of their moisture .
Prepare the batter by pouring the flour into a bowl. Then add the very cold water gradually, while stirring with a whisk to avoid lumps, until you get a smooth and soft consistency . Squeeze in the lemon drops and add a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil .
Rinse the zucchini well and lay them out on a clean towel or on paper towels. Pat them to dry thoroughly . Heat the oil in a skillet, and when it reaches 340°F (170°C), dip a few slices of zucchini into the batter .
Drop them into the oil and let them turn golden, it will take just a few minutes . Then drain on absorbent paper and sprinkle with salt . Enjoy your meal, your zucchini in batter are ready to be savored !
It would be ideal to prepare and eat the zucchini in batter immediately. If you want, you can store them in the fridge for a day, but the texture will suffer.
You can replace sparkling water with beer, always well chilled. Semolina flour is particularly suitable for a crisp and dry fry, but you can also replace it with wheat flour. Finally, you can enrich the batter with herbs or spices of your choice.
