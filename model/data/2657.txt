Treccia integrale is one of those breads you just can’t resist—really, it’s that good. With its braided shape and rustic, golden crust, this loaf is a favorite in Italy, especially where traditional bread-making is a big deal. The mix of whole wheat, manitoba, and spelt flours gives the treccia integrale a taste that's super super unique, with an open crumb you don’t find in regular bread. And the walnut pieces? Incredible. They add a really good crunch and nutty aroma. Pretty much irresistible.
It's not just about looks—this pane integrale fatto in casa is soft inside, with an aroma that, honestly, fills up your kitchen. Makes you want a slice before it even cools. And here's the thing: the braiding isn't just for show. It helps the dough rise beautifully—so light, but still hearty.
For those who like variety, the spelt version is a great pick. Spelt flour's super cherished in many Italian towns, especially up north. Really. And there’s something about the ricetta treccia integrale that feels traditional. Families have been making different versions for ages, using whatever local nuts or seeds they could find. That’s why you’ll stumble upon so many variations. Maybe a walnut-heavy loaf or one that's seed-packed. Perfect for breakfast.
When it’s time to eat, this pane intrecciato pairs well with almost anything. Salad, stew—really, whatever. Also, it’s just as really really good with a bit of jam in the morning. The outside is super crispy while the middle stays moist and tender. Every slice, a perfect mix of textures.
No wonder everyone keeps coming back to this classic ricetta pane integrale . It’s tasty, looks fantastic, and is always a hit with family or friends. Whether on a lazy Sunday morning or at a dinner party, it never fails to impress. For real.
To prepare the whole wheat braid, sift the manitoba flour, whole wheat flour, and spelt flour in a large bowl ; add the dry yeast and mix with a whisk. You can also use fresh yeast: in this case, the amount to use is 12 g. Dissolve the salt in lukewarm water .
And pour the salted water into the dough in a steady stream , gathering all the ingredients well with your hands. Knead very quickly (the dough will be very soft and sticky; you can transfer it to a work surface and handle it with a dough scraper, greasing with a little oil if necessary) , then form a ball and cover the dough you have obtained with plastic wrap , leaving it to rise for at least 1 hour in the switched-off oven with the light on to create a warm environment.
After the first hour, the dough will have swelled and doubled in volume . At this point, make folds to give the right boost to the leavening, gently lifting the outer edges and bringing them towards the center ; repeat this operation 8 times around the circumference of the dough, then turn it over and form a ball. Cover again with plastic wrap, letting it rest for another 1 hour, always in the turned-off oven with the light on. In the meantime, coarsely chop the walnuts with a knife to enrich the dough .
Take back the dough (which will have leavened in the meantime) ; grease the work surface with some oil and overturn the dough onto it ; make more folds to make it more elastic, then with a dough scraper divide it into 3 equal parts weighing 230 grams each , to form the braid.
At this point, flatten one piece at a time into a rectangular shape 16 inches long . Sprinkle with a handful of chopped walnuts and mixed seeds , (keep some aside to sprinkle over the braid before baking); gently roll each part over itself from the longest side with your hands to create a log , sealing the two ends well.
Once you have obtained 3 logs, join the three strands of leavened dough at one end and then braid them by overlapping one log over the other ; then seal the ends of the braid well .
Transfer the braid you have obtained onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper and cover it with plastic wrap, leaving it to rise in the switched-off oven with the light on for another 1 hour . After an hour, place a terracotta bowl (or another oven-safe material) full of water at the bottom of the oven to create a humid environment that will aid the baking of the bread. Sprinkle with the last seeds you had set aside and bake in a preheated static oven at 482°F for 20 minutes (in a fan oven at 446°F for 15 minutes). At this point, remove the bowl of water and lower the temperature to 356°F, baking for another 40 minutes (in a fan oven at 320°F for 30 minutes). Once cooked , take it out of the oven and let the whole wheat braid cool on a wire rack, then serve .
You can store the whole wheat braid in a food bag for about 2 days. It is possible to freeze the braid, preferably uncooked: to bake it, simply thaw it in the fridge about 24 hours before and then bake it in the oven. The dough can be frozen after the 3-hour rising time, only if all fresh ingredients have been used; let it thaw in the fridge and then bring it to room temperature before baking.
In addition to being very scenic and soft, the flavor of the braid pairs perfectly with cheeses and cold cuts, but also with jams and sweet creams. A tasty idea to accompany a lunch, dinner, or, why not, a good snack!
