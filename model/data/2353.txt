instructions:
To prepare the apricot clafoutis, start by cracking the eggs into a bowl and add the sugar . Beat with a whisk, or if you prefer, with an electric mixer, until you achieve a light and frothy mixture that doubles in volume. Then add the lemon zest and sifted flour directly into the bowl and quickly mix with a whisk to prevent lumps.
Add the salt , milk that is not too cold , and mix until you get a rather liquid batter. Finally, pour in the brandy and mix one last time.
At this point, wash the apricots under running water and use a knife to halve them and remove the pit. Cut each half apricot into 4 slices .
Take your mold, butter it, and coat it with sugar , shaking the mold slightly to remove the excess. Arrange the apricots in a circular pattern in the mold until the entire base is covered .
Lightly mix the batter and pour it over the apricots (13-14). Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F (180°C) for 55 minutes, until it is well golden on the surface (if you use a fan oven, bake at 320°F (160°C) for about 45 minutes). Once cooked, remove your apricot clafoutis from the oven, let it cool slightly, and serve.
Store your apricot clafoutis for up to 2 days in the refrigerator, well covered. If you prefer, you can freeze your clafoutis in freezer bags and let it thaw at room temperature before enjoying it.
To make this apricot clafoutis during the rest of the year, you can use canned apricots.
