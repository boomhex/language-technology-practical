instructions:
To prepare the easy and quick potato flatbread, start with the dough: dissolve the yeast in a bowl with the water , then add the oil and mix. Finally, add the flour, continuing to mix .
When it gains consistency , turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and continue working . At this point, incorporate the salt .
Work until you obtain a smooth dough . Transfer the dough ball to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rest for 45 minutes, or until it doubles in volume, under a woolen blanket .
After the time has passed, peel the potatoes and cut them into thin slices using a mandoline or a knife . Place the slices in a bowl and season with 1 tbsp of olive oil .
Add salt, pepper , and a bit of chopped rosemary , then mix everything and let it marinate .
Retrieve the risen dough, work it quickly on the floured work surface by pressing it with your fingertips . Transfer it to a 10 x 8-inch greased baking pan and spread it out to a thickness of about one-fifth of an inch, using 1 tsp of olive oil poured on top . At this point, arrange the potato slices on the surface, slightly overlapping them .
Season with 1 tsp of olive oil and a pinch of coarse salt . Bake in a static oven, preheated to 375°F, for about 20 minutes . Take it out and enjoy the easy and quick potato flatbread while it's still hot !
The easy and quick potato flatbread can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of one day.
You can also freeze it once cooked; let it thaw at room temperature before reheating.
Want to add some cheese? Halfway through cooking, add melting cheeses like mozzarella, scamorza, or caciocavallo.
If you want to prepare in advance by cutting the potatoes, make sure to keep them in a bowl with fresh water before draining and seasoning them, so they don't turn brown.
