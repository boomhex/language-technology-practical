To prepare the lasagna cupcakes, start by preparing the egg pasta: place the flour in a mound on a work surface, make a well in the center, break the eggs into it, and mix the eggs with the flour from the edges using a fork. Then work the dough with your hands until all the flour is incorporated, kneading vigorously and, if necessary, add a tablespoon of warm water to soften the dough. Continue kneading until the dough is smooth and compact. Wrap the obtained dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for at least half an hour in a cool, dry place.
Now move to the sauce preparation: finely chop the celery, carrot, and onion and sauté them in a large saucepan with butter . Let them brown for 15 minutes, then add the crumbled sausage , cook for a couple of minutes, and deglaze with red wine . Adjust with salt and pepper.
Add the tomato paste to the beef broth and add it to the sautéed vegetables and crumbled sausage . Leave the sauce on the heat for 15-20 minutes, add the tomato puree, and continue cooking on low heat for at least 50 minutes. In the meantime, prepare the bechamel following the instructions Béchamel sauce (Bechamel).
Roll out the fresh egg pasta with a pasta machine, starting with the widest thickness and gradually moving to the thinnest . Once you have the sheets, cut out 12 square sheets of pasta, each side 4 inches . Blanch the pasta squares for a few seconds in boiling salted water .
From the remaining sheets, cut out 12 pasta circles with a diameter of about 2.5 inches and blanch them as well in boiling salted water . Butter a 12-cupcake or muffin tin or 12 individual molds.
Place a square of pasta in each mold of the tin and start assembling the lasagna cupcakes: first add a tablespoon of bechamel , then one of sauce in each pasta square, and sprinkle with a tablespoon of grated Parmesan .
Continue with another layer: place the pasta circles in each cupcake and cover them with a tablespoon of bechamel, one of sauce , and a sprinkle of grated Parmesan. Bake the lasagna cupcakes in a static oven at 320°F for 40-45 minutes. Your lasagna cupcakes are ready to serve!
Consume the lasagna cupcakes immediately or store them in the refrigerator in a container with a lid for up to one day. Lasagna cupcakes can be frozen; if you decide to freeze them raw, you should leave them in the tin, if cooked, you can place them in the freezer in an airtight container, but when it's time to reheat them, you'll need to place them back in the muffin tins.
For the lasagna cupcakes, if you prefer, instead of the sausage sauce, you can prepare the classic Ragu' alla bolognese !
