instructions:
To make the coconut cake, pour the whole eggs into a bowl, add the brown sugar , the salt , and whip the mixture with the electric beaters .
Once you have obtained a smooth and clear batter, add the coconut oil . Continue mixing with the beaters and then gradually incorporate the sifted flour and baking powder .
After another round of beating, which will help absorb the powders, add the yogurt and shredded coconut . Mix again with the electric beaters .
Once you have a smooth, lump-free batter , butter a pan that measures 8 inches at the base and 9 inches at the top , dust it with grated coconut .
You should cover both the bottom and the edges . Pour the batter into the pan , sprinkle more shredded coconut on top .
Bake the cake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 40 minutes on the middle rack of the oven. Once baking is complete, take your coconut cake out of the oven and, once cooled, remove it onto a serving plate and garnish with powdered sugar .
The coconut cake can be stored outside the refrigerator for 3-4 days, covered with a glass dome. After baking, it can be frozen and stored for a month.
Replace the plain yogurt with strawberry or peach yogurt to enrich your coconut cake with a fruity flavor.
