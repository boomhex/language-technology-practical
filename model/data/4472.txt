To prepare the cassata tile, start with the sponge cake: place eggs, sugar, and a pinch of salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat the mixture with the whisk for about 10 minutes . Meanwhile, sift flour and potato starch together using a sieve .
When you have obtained a foamy mixture, gradually incorporate the sifted powders and mix gently with a spatula from bottom to top . Pour the mixture into a well-buttered and floured 10x10 inch square pan . Bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 30 minutes.
Prepare the syrup: in a saucepan, pour water and sugar and heat until the sugar is completely dissolved . Remove from heat and let cool, then add the liquor .
Mix and set aside . Prepare the cream: sift the well-drained ricotta into a bowl .
Add the chocolate chips and the candied orange cut into small cubes . Mix, cover with plastic wrap, and store in the fridge .
Remove the sponge cake from the oven , let it cool slightly, then turn it upside down on the wire rack and let it cool completely. Remove the crust from the edges of the sponge cake .
Do the same for the base and surface , then cut the sponge cake horizontally into 2 equal parts , then cut it further in half and make 3 thin rectangles the size of your loaf pan: we used a 10x4 inch pan, 3 inches high.
Line the loaf pan with plastic wrap, then brush a rectangular base of sponge cake with the syrup . Place the first layer on the bottom , transfer the cream into a piping bag without a nozzle and fill with half of the cream .
Level the surface with a spatula and place a second rectangle of sponge cake , then brush this with the syrup as well. Complete with the remaining cream and level the surface well .
Place the third rectangle of sponge cake, brush with the liquor syrup and close with the plastic wrap . Refrigerate for at least 5 hours or overnight. After the resting time, retrieve the hardened mold, turn it over onto a serving plate and remove the plastic wrap .
Roll out the marzipan block on the work surface dusted with powdered sugar using a rolling pin ; you should obtain a layer about 1/5 inch thick large enough to cover the entire tile. Cover the cake with the marzipan and press it well on all sides . Store in the refrigerator and proceed with the royal icing.
In a bowl, pour the egg whites, lemon juice, and powdered sugar . Beat with electric whisks until you get a homogeneous mixture .
Transfer the royal icing into a piping bag with a 2 mm round nozzle and decorate the entire edge with a wavy pattern . Garnish with candied fruit as desired and serve your cassata tile immediately !
The cassata tile can be stored for 2 days in the refrigerator.
Freezing is not recommended.
For an alcohol-free version, you can omit the liquor and infuse citrus peels in the syrup.
If you do not like sheep ricotta, you can use cow ricotta.
With the leftover sponge cake, you can make mini cassatas, or delicious Cake pops !
