To prepare the scaloppine with taleggio and radicchio, first cut 8 slices from the veal loin , then pound them with a meat tenderizer . Transfer the slices into a container and coat them in flour to cover them evenly on both sides .
Wash and clean the radicchio, then cut it into strips . Slice the taleggio as well . In a saucepan, melt the butter with the oil and aromatic herbs, letting it flavor for a couple of minutes .
Place the meat in the pan and brown for 3 minutes over medium-high heat, then turn the slices over using kitchen tongs . Salt and pepper .
Deglaze with white wine and let it evaporate, then add the radicchio strips on top of each scaloppina and cover with the taleggio slices .
Cover with the lid , then lower the heat and continue cooking for another 5 minutes. As soon as the cheese has melted , remove them from the pan and serve your scaloppine with taleggio and radicchio immediately !
