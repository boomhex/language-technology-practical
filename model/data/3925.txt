instructions:
Place the myrtle berries in an airtight container large enough to hold both the berries and the alcohol. Cover the myrtle berries with the alcohol and let it rest in a dark, cool place for at least 40 days, shaking the container occasionally. After this time, strain the alcohol from the myrtle berries and residues and gently squeeze the berries with a cloth or cheesecloth to extract all the juices and essences they have absorbed. Meanwhile, prepare a syrup by boiling the water and dissolving the sugar in it; once the syrup is ready, let it cool and then mix it with the flavored alcohol. Strain everything again, bottle it, and let the liqueur thus obtained rest for at least a month, preferably two, in a cool place.
You can adjust the amounts of water and sugar to make the myrtle liqueur better suited to your taste, bearing in mind that if you have 1 liter of essence (with alcohol at 90°), adding 1 liter of syrup will halve the alcohol's volume percentage, resulting in a liqueur with an alcohol content of about 45°. Increasing the amount of syrup will therefore result in a lower alcohol content. In some areas of Sardinia, myrtle is made by replacing part or all of the sugar with an equivalent weight of honey (often arbutus honey).
The best time to make myrtle liqueur is undoubtedly during the winter period, as the myrtle berries must be harvested when they have reached their distinctive black color and have not yet become too hard; this occurs from November to January, depending on the climate and the exposure of the myrtle bushes.
