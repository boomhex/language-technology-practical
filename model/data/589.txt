instructions:
To prepare the pappardelle with lentil and mushroom ragout, first, rinse the dried mushrooms, then soak them in cold water for at least 10-15 minutes, just enough time to prepare the rest. Now, take care of the lentil ragout: clean the carrot, celery, and onion, then chop them finely . Pour the extra-virgin olive oil into a saucepan .
Add the chopped vegetables for the sauté , the thyme sprigs, and the garlic , and let them brown over moderate heat for about 10 minutes. In the meantime, rinse the lentils and add them to the sauté .
Mix everything and add the tomato puree . Add the already soaked and drained mushrooms , also pour in 100 g of soaking water after filtering it through a cheesecloth to remove impurities , and mix again. Let it cook for about 40 minutes. Cooking times may vary depending on the type of lentils you purchase, so we recommend reading the instructions on the package and following them.
Only when the ragout is cooked, remove the garlic and adjust the salt and pepper . Cook the pappardelle in boiling salted water.
Drain the pasta into the pan and toss the pappardelle with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil . Serve the pappardelle with lentil and mushroom ragout piping hot .
We recommend consuming the pappardelle immediately. The ragout can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days at most. Alternatively, it can be frozen if you have used fresh ingredients.
You can replace the dried mushrooms with fresh mushrooms: in this case, sauté them separately in a pan and then add them to the lentil ragout. You can add a sprinkle of grated Parmigiano Reggiano PDO at the end of cooking the pasta.
