Golden ribbons of pasta come together with bacon , pecorino cheese , and crisp pancetta for a meal that's always a family favorite. Fresh broad beans add just the right splash of color to this spring dish , making the whole plate pop with green against the creamy background. The salty tang of pecorino cheese pairs so well with the creamy sauce and the bold flavor from both bacon and pancetta . Every forkful feels special—soft pasta twirls, a little crunch from the meat, and nice bits of bean in almost every bite. Looks pretty impressive on the table but even better, it just tastes good . You get mild sweet notes from the beans swirling together with bold, savory cheese in a way that keeps people coming back for seconds.
Weekend gatherings or weeknight family dinners both work great with this pasta—the all-in-one quality means home cooks always get nice , reliable results. Because the blend of bacon and fresh fava beans is so easygoing, this dish fits all kinds of occasions: from cozy spring lunches to relaxed celebrations with friends. Kids love the touch of sweet from the beans, while adults appreciate that cheesy, creamy richness. Busy families get a ton of mileage out of the versatility —it’s easy to switch things up with different sides (try crusty bread, a leafy green salad , or just leave it plain for true classic taste). Works well as a main, a side for bigger holiday spreads, or even cold for the lunchbox. Since the heart of this pasta is all about bacon , pecorino cheese , pancetta , and seasonal beans, every version feels fresh , satisfying, and so easy to make memories around the table. If you like dishes that bring everyone together without fuss but with plenty of DELICIOUS flavor...this one always delivers.
To prepare a mixed board of broad beans, pecorino, and bacon, start by cleaning the bacon. Take the whole piece of bacon, remove the underlying rind , any yellowed parts on the sides, and the dark upper part. Then slice it into thick slices of about 1/8 inch . Remove the crust from the pecorino and slice it to the desired thickness , or if very aged, divide it into individual pieces or small flakes.
To shell the broad beans, detach one of the ends of the pod . Divide the pod in half, spreading the two ends apart and opening it completely , extract the seeds by running your thumb along the inside of the pod, and collect the seeds in a bowl. Then remove the growth covering the broad bean seed by detaching it with your fingers .
Always with your fingers, apply slight pressure on the skin or make a small cut with a knife and detach the outer peel of the broad bean . Slice the country-style loaf and serve everything according to your taste. You might choose to place all ingredients on a single board , or to divide everything among 4 serving plates. The important thing is to accompany the broad beans, pecorino, and bacon with a good glass of red wine.
Consume the broad beans, pecorino, and bacon as soon as they are prepared! Alternatively, keep the slices of bacon and pecorino wrapped in plastic wrap and the broad beans enclosed in a container for a maximum of two days!
The choice of pecorino and its aging can be subjective: in Lazio, for example, preference is given to Roman pecorino “with the drop,” an exceptional and very flavorful cheese, but semi-aged table pecorino, less flavorful and sweeter on the palate, is equally suitable. The choice is yours!
Broad beans have a high waste percentage, in fact from 2.2 lbs of pods, about 7-9 oz of shelled broad beans will be obtained. If the broad beans you purchased are very fresh, they are small and tender, once shelled it will not be necessary to remove the outer membrane (in this case very tender), but only the small growth present on the side. How to recognize the freshness of freshly picked broad beans? Simple: externally the pods should be turgid and crunchy with a beautiful intense green color. Once shelled, the broad beans should be swollen, green, and spotless; but the litmus test consists of removing the growth on the side of each one and ensuring no black is present underneath.
