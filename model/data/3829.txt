instructions:
To make the cookies with walnuts and hazelnuts, place the walnuts and shelled hazelnuts in a blade-equipped mixer, and finely chop them .
Then sift the obtained powders with a sieve into a bowl. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, pour the egg whites , a pinch of salt, turn on the mixer, and add the sugar gradually, one tablespoon at a time .
Meanwhile, take the vanilla bean, cut it lengthwise with a knife, and extract the seeds to add to the egg white and sugar mixture . Beat until very stiff and when the mixture is glossy and foamy
turn off the mixer and fold in the walnut and hazelnut flour, one tablespoon at a time , stirring gently to avoid deflating the egg whites. Once the walnut and hazelnut flour is well combined , transfer it to a pastry bag with a plain tip ,
butter a baking sheet and place a sheet of parchment paper on top, then pipe small mounds, about 1.5 inches in diameter and about 1.2 inches in height, spaced at least 1 inch apart from each other (13-14). Bake the cookies in a preheated static oven at 212°F for 2 hours (or in a fan-assisted oven at 176°F for 1 hour and 20 minutes). Once baked, remove the cookies with walnuts and hazelnuts from the oven and let them cool before enjoying them .
Store the cookies with walnuts and hazelnuts in a tin box or a glass jar for 5 days. If well protected from air, for example in an airtight food bag, they can be stored even longer.
If desired, you can replace the walnuts and hazelnuts with other chopped nuts like almonds (keeping the same quantities as the recipe), or you can place a round or broken wafer under the cookie dough before baking.
