It's a way to connect with the region's history and celebrate its culinary heritage. Whether you are enjoying it with friends or savoring it solo, the polacca aversana is bound to bring a smile—showing the heart and hospitality of Aversa. And really, cannot go wrong with that.
To make the Aversana Polish cake, first prepare the dough: sift the Manitoba flour into a bowl, then add the fresh yeast, crumbling it directly with your hands, add the sugar and mix well. Pour the flour, yeast, and sugar mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer with the hook attachment and start kneading at low speed; while the mixer is running, pour in the room temperature water slowly ,
then the room temperature milk and the eggs, previously beaten in a small bowl (also at room temperature) . Once the eggs have been absorbed, also add the salt
and the grated zest of a small lemon (being careful to take only the colored part, less bitter) . Finally, add the softened butter little by little, making sure each piece is well absorbed before adding the next , and continue working the dough until it adheres to the hook, becoming smooth and elastic .
Now transfer the dough onto the work surface and work it by hand just long enough to form a ball; place it in a bowl , cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise in the oven turned off with the light on for about 2 hours or until it has doubled in volume. While the dough is rising, you can prepare the filling cream: pour the milk into a fairly large saucepan, add the seeds from the vanilla pod , and bring it almost to a boil.
In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar with a whisk to combine them , then sift the flour into the bowl and beat further to combine. Add a ladle of hot milk to the egg mixture and stir to temper it ,
then pour the egg mixture into the saucepan with the rest of the milk and bring it to a boil over low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring continuously with a whisk until thickened . Once the cream has thickened, transfer it to a baking dish, cover with cling film in contact , and let it cool at room temperature for about twenty minutes, then put it in the refrigerator and let it cool completely for about 2 hours.
Meanwhile, drain the cherries from their syrup, cut them in half with a knife , and set aside. Once the rising time has elapsed, take the dough and divide it into two equal parts ; lightly flour the work surface and roll each dough portion
until you form a disk 9.5 inches in diameter and 1/5 inch thick . Roll one of the two disks onto the rolling pin and transfer it to a baking sheet (there is no need to brush with oil or butter) . At this point, you can take the cream from the refrigerator, now cold, and transfer it into a piping bag without a nozzle, then squeeze the cream starting from the center of the first disk and spiraling outward .
Use a spatula or the back of a spoon to spread the cream layer evenly, being careful to leave about 3/4 inch from the edge free . Distribute the sliced cherries over the cream , then gently place the second dough disk over the cream so that it covers the filling well .
Take a 9-inch steel ring (alternatively, you can use the removable circle of a cake pan, without the base and the same size), place it over the cream-filled disks and remove the excess dough , then with your fingertips, carefully seal the edges of the two dough disks . Beat the egg yolk with the milk in a small bowl and brush the cake's surface with the mixture obtained ,
finally, sprinkle it with granulated sugar . Bake the Aversana Polish cake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 30 minutes, until the surface is nicely golden . Once baked, take the cake out of the oven and let it cool; if desired, you can dust it with powdered sugar. Your delicious Aversana Polish cake is finally ready to be served !
The Aversana Polish cake can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days, covered with plastic wrap. If you wish, you can freeze the Aversana Polish cake in slices, to be thawed as needed.
To achieve an exceptionally soft and fluffy Aversana Polish cake, it's essential that all the ingredients used for the dough are at room temperature; also, remember to add the butter very gradually, allowing time for the dough to absorb it completely before adding more. If you're a careful pastry chef and are wondering why we used flour instead of cornstarch in this Pastry cream , here's the answer: flour in this case allows for a denser and more compact cream that will wonderfully hold its shape when you cut the first slice! Finally, a couple of small variations not to stray too far from the original recipe: you can scent the cream with lemon or lime zest instead of vanilla or sprinkle the cake with sugar grains instead of powdered sugar... happy Aversana Polish cake to everyone!
It is said that the Aversana Polish cake was born in 1926 when a Polish nun gave the recipe for a typical dessert from her homeland to pastry chef Nicola Mungiguerra, who reworked it to suit our tastes: the "Gran Polacca" soon became the most loved dessert in the city, and the Mungiguerra pastry shop still jealously guards the recipe. Nowadays, there is also a single-serving version called "polacchina," specially designed for the breakfast of Aversans who love to enjoy it in the morning in place of a croissant!
