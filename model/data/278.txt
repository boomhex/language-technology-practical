instructions:
To prepare the pea farinata with zucchini, wash and trim the zucchini , then slice them first lengthwise and then into sticks .
Finally, cut them into small cubes of about a quarter inch . Peel and slice the shallot . Heat some oil in a non-stick pan, then add the sliced shallot .
Add the peeled garlic clove and let it turn golden over low heat. Add the diced zucchini , season with salt and sauté over medium-high heat for a few minutes.
Remove the garlic clove and set the zucchini aside . Chop the rosemary and sage .
Blend the dried peas in a very powerful mixer to obtain flour . In a bowl, pour the pea flour and water .
Add the oil , then season with the chopped herbs and salt .
Finally, incorporate the sautéed and cooled zucchini . Mix well to combine everything. Grease a non-stick baking pan with a diameter of 13.5 inches and a height of about 0.75 inches . Sprinkle the bottom with breadcrumbs .
Pour the mixture into the pan and spread it evenly . Bake in a static oven at 428°F for 30 minutes. Remove your pea farinata with zucchini from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving !
The pea farinata with zucchini is best enjoyed freshly baked, but it can be stored in the fridge covered up to 2 days. We recommend reheating it before serving.
Instead of dried peas, you can use the same amount of pea flour.
