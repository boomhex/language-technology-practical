To prepare saffron custard, first, in a saucepan, pour the milk and cream and add the vanilla. Heat to 140°F, or until hot . Meanwhile, in a bowl, place the egg yolks and add the sugar and mix with a whisk until you obtain a homogeneous mixture.
Add the cornstarch and mix until incorporated. Dissolve the saffron in a tablespoon of hot water .
Pour the saffron into the hot milk and stir. At this point, pour the milk into the egg yolk mixture . Mix and transfer everything back to the saucepan .
Cook on low heat, stirring continuously , for 5-6 minutes, until thickened. Add the grated lemon zest , stir vigorously once more to prevent lumps from forming, and transfer everything to a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap in contact and let cool first at room temperature, then place it in the refrigerator. Your saffron custard is ready to use!
Saffron custard can be stored in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap in contact, for 2-3 days.
Instead of lemon zest, you can use orange zest. If the dessert is intended for adults, you can add a small amount of amaretto or limoncello liqueur to the warm custard. If the custard turns out too thick once cooled, beat it with an electric mixer for a few minutes.
