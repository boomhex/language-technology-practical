instructions:
To prepare the spinach green pasta, put 2 oz of washed and drained spinach to boil in a saucepan with 2 tablespoons of water and a pinch of salt. Cover with a lid and let the spinach cook and dry , then pass them through a sieve .
to obtain a smooth cream . In a bowl, pour the sifted flour, the eggs (which you have kept at room temperature), and the spinach cream , then mix the ingredients well .
Then transfer to a pastry board and knead until you obtain a homogeneous dough; if the dough does not fully incorporate the flour or seems slightly hard, add one or two tablespoons of warm water and continue kneading until it becomes smooth and compact . Then let it rest covered for at least half an hour in a cool place. After resting, the fresh pasta will be softer and more elastic: get ready to roll it out to obtain the desired shape, proceeding by hand (following the instructions you Homemade pasta (sheets and shapes) ) or with the special machine.
We recommend using the fresh egg pasta immediately, but if you wish, you can store it vacuum-sealed for a couple of days at most. Alternatively, it can be frozen raw, once the desired shapes are made.
