instructions:
To make the strawberry roll, start by preparing the white chocolate cream, which should rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours or preferably overnight to reach the ideal consistency. First, chop the white chocolate with a knife and set it aside, then place the gelatin in a bowl, cover it with cold water , and let it soak for about 10 minutes. In the meantime, pour the milk and cream into a saucepan and heat gently, without bringing to a boil.
Place the egg yolks in a bowl, add the brown sugar , and beat with a whisk to combine. When the milk and cream mixture is warm, pour a small amount into the bowl with the yolks and mix well with the whisk. At this point, combine the tempered yolk mixture with the remaining milk in the saucepan and return it to the heat.
Heat the mixture gently, monitoring the temperature with a thermometer and stirring regularly : when the liquid temperature reaches 181°F (83°C), remove the saucepan from the heat and add the pre-soaked gelatin, making sure to squeeze it well ; mix to incorporate it.
Now add the gelatin mixture to the chopped white chocolate and carefully mix with a spatula until the chocolate is completely melted. Cover the cream with plastic wrap in contact and let it rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
To prepare the sponge cake, first preheat the oven to static mode at 356°F (180°C), then separate the yolks from the egg whites. Place the yolks in a bowl and beat them with an electric whisk (or in a stand mixer), gradually adding half of the sugar for this preparation . After incorporating the sugar, add the honey and continue to beat until you obtain a white and frothy mixture , which you will set aside for the moment.
Gradually add the remaining sugar to the egg whites , and whip them with the electric whisk until they have doubled in volume and reached a firm consistency .
At this point, gently fold the whipped egg whites into the yolk mixture , mixing carefully with a spatula from bottom to top until well incorporated . Add the all-purpose flour
and almond flour and mix again with the spatula to incorporate them into the mixture, always making gentle movements from bottom to top . Now line a baking tray measuring 12x15 inches (30x38 cm) with parchment paper, pour the batter into the center
and spread it evenly with a spatula so it has a uniform thickness and covers the entire surface . Bake the sponge cake in the preheated static oven at 356°F (180°C) for 10-12 minutes, placing it on the lower rack of the oven, until it is slightly golden. For optimal results, adjust according to the power of your oven, and avoid overbaking. Once the sponge cake is baked, place another sheet of parchment paper on top; flip it carefully onto a work surface. Allow it to cool slightly before gently removing the top parchment paper , being very careful not to damage the cake; then let it cool completely .
Now you can prepare the strawberries: wash them and cut them into medium-thick slices , then place them in a saucepan with the lemon juice and sugar .
Heat the strawberries over low heat for a couple of minutes, just long enough to dissolve the sugar , then transfer them to a sieve to collect the juice that has formed in the pan . Set aside both the strawberries and the juice .
When all the preparations are ready, you can assemble your strawberry roll. Retrieve the white chocolate cream from the fridge and work it with a spatula to soften it . Cover the entire surface of the sponge cake with the cream, spreading it with a spatula , then add the strawberries and distribute them evenly .
Gently lift the parchment paper from the shorter side and start rolling the sponge cake onto itself . Continue rolling it until reaching the other end , then seal the parchment paper well and place the roll to firm up in the fridge for at least 3 hours.
After the resting time, remove the roll from the fridge and remove the parchment paper . Now brush the outer part of the roll with the strawberry juice you set aside , then sprinkle it with powdered sugar. If you wish to create a more original decoration, cut strips of parchment paper and place them diagonally on the roll's surface ,
then dust with powdered sugar and gently remove the strips, which will have created a geometric pattern . Your wonderful strawberry roll is ready to be served !
The strawberry roll can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 days. You can also freeze it already filled.
To help you give a regular shape to your roll, you can let it set in a baguette mold. If you wish to add a fragrant note to the filling, you can flavor the white chocolate cream with vanilla or with a couple of tablespoons of strawberry juice. As for the strawberries, you can add a few fresh mint leaves to the pan or use lime, orange, or grapefruit juice instead of lemon. Finally, if you prefer, you can sauté the strawberries with a couple of tablespoons of honey instead of sugar.
