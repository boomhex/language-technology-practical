To prepare sugar paste, start by soaking the gelatin in very cold water to soften it . Heat the glucose in a thick-bottomed saucepan along with the water, but do not bring it to a boil. Then, squeeze the gelatin and add it to the syrup with the glucose. Sift the powdered sugar into a bowl and add the glucose and glycerin, then knead until the powdered sugar is completely absorbed.
Transfer the mixture to a work surface dusted with powdered sugar and continue to knead until it is smooth and homogeneous and no longer sticks to your hands. If you wish to make colored sugar paste, divide it into small portions and add the desired coloring (preferably gel or paste) . Continue kneading vigorously until the coloring is absorbed and the color is uniform. If you want a more intense color, just add more coloring a little at a time. Finally, wrap the sugar paste in plastic wrap and store it in a cool, dry place until you're ready to use it!
Store the sugar paste tightly wrapped in plastic wrap and placed in a tin box, for no more than 2-3 days.
Glycerin is used to make the sugar paste more moldable; if you can't find it, you can omit it. As an alternative to glucose, you can use the same amount of honey.
