instructions:
To make fried ice cream, first cut the roll into slices about half a cm (0.2 inch) thick ; you'll need 16 in total. Place 3 slices in the palm of your hand and put a scoop of ice cream in the center, using a scoop .
Cover with another slice and gently press with your hands to form a ball with a uniform appearance . Wrap each ball with plastic wrap, then place them on a tray and put them in the freezer . Let them solidify for at least 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the batter: sift the flour into a bowl, then add the baking powder , the seed oil , and the cold water .
Mix with a hand whisk to obtain a smooth, creamy, lump-free mixture . After the cooling time, pour the seed oil for frying into a pot and bring it to a temperature of 340°F-355°F. Dip one ball at a time into the batter, turning it with the help of a spoon to cover it completely , then immerse it in the boiling oil .
Fry the ball for 2-3 minutes until golden, then drain and transfer to absorbent paper . Continue in this way with all the other pieces and serve your fried ice cream immediately !
It is recommended to consume fried ice cream immediately.
You can prepare the balls in advance and leave them in the freezer for up to 7 days.
If you wish, you can dust the fried ice cream with powdered sugar before serving it or finish it with a kitchen torch for a flambé version!
