In a fairly large and thick-bottomed pan, heat 2 cups of granulated sugar over low heat: the thick bottom helps to evenly distribute the heat, preventing the sugar from burning before it caramelizes. In another small pot, bring 1 cup of water to a boil, adding the seeds of the vanilla pod (which can be replaced, if necessary, with any other flavor, according to your taste). It is important to boil the water because if you add it cold to the caramel, instead of mixing with it, the caramel will solidify. When the sugar has caramelized and reached the typical brown color, directly add the boiling water to the pot and stir quickly.
Remove the caramel sauce from the heat, stir briefly, and let it cool.
Be very careful: caramelizes at about 284°F, while water boils at 212°F, so when you add the water to the caramel, it is very likely that the temperature difference will cause some splashing; therefore, protect your hands and arms with a kitchen towel.
Caramel sauce can be stored at room temperature in a sealed jar for about 1 month.
