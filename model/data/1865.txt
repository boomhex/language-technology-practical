To make the soup with pork meatballs and ginger, first bring the water to a boil in a large pot, then proceed to prepare the ingredients for the broth. Wash the Swiss chard, remove the bottom parts of the stems and coarsely chop them into pieces . Wash the lemongrass sticks, remove the ends, and cut them into fairly large chunks . Finally, wash the chili pepper and cut it into slices .
When the water reaches a boil, add the soy sauce , the Swiss chard , and the lemongrass ,
the fresh ginger that you have previously peeled , the dashi , and the chili pepper and let it simmer for about 20 minutes.
In the meantime, you can prepare the meatballs: place the ground pork in a large bowl, add the crushed garlic clove , salt , pepper, and grated ginger
and the finely chopped chives , then mix the mixture with your hands and form balls about 1.25 inches in diameter. Heat the vegetable oil in a pan, place the meatballs inside
and cook over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes, turning them on all sides to brown them evenly . In the meantime, wash, trim, and slice the spring onion into thin rounds . When the soup is ready, divide it into serving bowls ,
then add about 4 meatballs per person and garnish with fresh spring onion . Your soup with pork meatballs and ginger is ready to be enjoyed piping hot !
You can store the soup and pork meatballs separately in the refrigerator for up to one day. You can freeze the raw meatballs if you used fresh, not thawed, ingredients.
Dashi can be easily purchased online or at ethnic grocery stores, but if you can't find it, you can replace it with vegetable or light chicken broth. Ginger and lemongrass are added in large pieces so they can be easily located and removed from the soup once cooked: their particularly pungent flavor, in fact, is not very pleasant on the palate. You can further enrich the soup with pork meatballs and ginger by adding noodles or dried mushrooms to turn it into a tasty one-pot meal!
