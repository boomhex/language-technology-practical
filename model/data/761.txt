instructions:
To prepare the rice cream pasticciotti, first make the pastry dough. In a bowl, pour the flour and cold butter cubes , mix them well with your hands until you obtain a "sandy" mixture. Transfer to a work surface and add the powdered sugar .
Mix with your hands and form a well. Pour the egg yolks in the center and the vanilla bean seeds .
Knead quickly with your hands until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough . Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator.
In the meantime, prepare the cream: pour the rice milk into a small pot , add the vanilla seeds and bring it to just under a boil. In another pot, pour the eggs, the yolk, and the sugar; mix with a whisk until you obtain a well-blended mixture.
Add the flour , mix, and also add the cornstarch . Blend well with the whisk. You should get a smooth mixture without lumps.
As soon as the milk starts to boil, slowly pour it into the egg yolk mixture , continuing to mix. Cook over low heat, always stirring, until the cream reaches the desired consistency .
Transfer it to a baking dish and cover with cling film pressed directly onto the surface . Retrieve the pastry dough and roll it out with a rolling pin. You should achieve a thickness of 1/4 inch . Using a round cutter of 4 inches, cut out the first disk , you will need 24.
Transfer it inside an oval mold measuring 2.5 x 4 inches. Press well into the edges with your fingers and fill with cream almost to the brim .
Trim the excess dough with a small knife and place another pastry disk on top. Press the edges well to make it adhere and again trim the excess dough with a small knife . Continue in this way until you form 12 pasticciotti.
Mix the egg yolk and rice milk in a small bowl, transfer the pasticciotti to a baking tray and brush each one . At this point , bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 30 minutes, on the middle shelf. When they are golden, your pasticciotti are ready to be removed from the oven . Serve them warm or cold.
You can store the rice cream pasticciotti in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
You can flavor the pastry dough with lemon zest or a pinch of cinnamon.
