To prepare the chicken with potatoes, mushrooms, and pearl onions, first put a pot of salted water on the stove, which you will use for the Vegetable broth . Pick the rosemary and thyme , add the sage and garlic, chop all the herbs finely , and place them in a bowl;
add the paprika (half a level teaspoon will be enough) , mix with a teaspoon and set aside . Flame the chicken to remove any remaining feathers, rinse it thoroughly under running water, and dry it, then use a knife to remove the tail .
Take the chopped herbs and fill the inside of the chicken one tablespoon at a time (keep a small part that you will need later), seasoning with salt and pepper (8-9).
Close the chicken with the help of a kitchen needle and string . Once this operation is completed, cut the excess thread , then sprinkle the outside of the chicken with the herbs you set aside .
Place a pot with a thick bottom on the stove with a drizzle of oil. Lay the chicken in it , turning it on both sides with kitchen tongs for even browning, then deglaze with white wine . Add the cleaned pearl onions ,
placing them next to each other and turning them on both sides for even cooking until they are well browned: it will take about 6-7 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the potatoes into fairly large cubes . Slightly move the onions and add the cut potatoes to the pot, browning them for a few minutes .
Pour in the vegetable broth you prepared and continue cooking for 40 minutes on low heat, covering with a lid . In the meantime, start How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms : with the help of a sharp knife with a smooth blade, start removing the earthy part on the stem, scraping it gently until all traces of soil are removed . Remove any residues with a brush or a cotton cloth; otherwise, if the mushrooms are still very dirty, quickly rinse them under a stream of cold running water.
After the necessary time has passed, add the cleaned whole mushrooms and let cook for 10 minutes, still covering with the lid. Then remove the lid and cook for another 5 minutes: turn off the heat and your chicken with potatoes, mushrooms, and pearl onions is ready to be served .
You can store the chicken with potatoes, mushrooms, and pearl onions in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. You can freeze it if you used fresh products.
