instructions:
To prepare the melon salad, start by cleaning the melon. Remove the two ends, split it in half, and scoop out the seeds and fibers using a spoon . Then slice and peel it , and finally cut into pieces about an inch or so .
Set aside and work on the radishes. The first thing to do is to remove the leaves and the ends . Rinse thoroughly and then slice thinly to get rounds .
Finally, cut the Greek feta into small cubes and assemble your salad. In a bowl, add the rinsed lamb's lettuce, radish rounds , then the pitted black olives and feta .
Add the melon cubes, then season with salt, vinegar , and a splash of oil . Mix well and plate your melon salad, garnishing, if desired, with a sprig of fresh mint .
Any type of storage is not recommended because the fruit, besides losing color and flavor, tends to become acidic.
This melon salad is so simple and original you can really enrich it as you prefer. How about adding some toasted nuts in a pan? Or cubes of bread tossed with oil and rosemary! If you want some substitutions, try carrots instead of radishes and mozzarella instead of feta.
