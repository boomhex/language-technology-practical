To prepare the gratinated fennel in a pan, first wash and clean the fennel by removing the base and the upper part, then remove the outermost layer. Cut the fennel in half and slice them thinly ; you should obtain about 2 lbs of cleaned fennel. Transfer the fennel into a bowl and season with 1 tbsp of oil and the mix of dried oregano, parsley, rosemary, and thyme .
Also add the salt and the chervil , then mix well to flavor .
Proceed with cooking: heat the remaining oil in a large pan, pour in the fennel and cook for 5 minutes over high heat . At this point, add the grated orange zest and the water , lower the heat and cook with the lid on for 10 minutes.
After this time, add the olives and the breadcrumbs , then increase the heat again and mix for about a minute until the coating is golden . Your gratinated fennel in a pan is ready to be served!
The gratinated fennel in a pan can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container. Alternatively, you can freeze them.
If you wish, you can further flavor the gratinated fennel in a pan by adding sun-dried tomatoes in oil and toasted pine nuts!
You can vary the proposed aroma mix by using, for example, fresh parsley instead of chervil.
• What is the season for fennel?
From October to May, although it is quite easy to find them during the rest of the year as well.
• Why does fennel taste like anise?
Because it is rich in anethole, an essential oil that gives it its characteristic aroma.
• What are the benefits of fennel?
Thanks to their high water content, they help eliminate toxins and excess liquids, promoting diuresis and digestion. Moreover, they have very low caloric content.
• What is the difference between fennel and wild fennel?
They belong to the same family, but sweet fennel, used in this recipe, is cultivated while wild fennel grows spontaneously.
• What is the bulb?
It is the white part of the fennel, the edible part: fennel with a round bulb is more suitable for being eaten raw, while those with an elongated bulb are more fibrous and therefore preferable for cooking.
