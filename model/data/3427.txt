To prepare the salmon risotto, first make the broth: clean the vegetables and cut them into pieces , place them in a saucepan with the peppercorns , cover with water and boil for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the acidic butter: slice the onion .
In a small pot, pour the vegetable oil and stew the onion for about 10 minutes over medium-low heat . Then pour in the vinegar .
Add the white wine and continue over medium-high heat for about 10-15 minutes . Meanwhile, clean the salmon and cut it into 3/4 inch pieces .
When the onions have become translucent , add the butter off the heat and stir to melt it .
Now strain the butter with a sieve and let it cool in the fridge .  In a saucepan, pour 2 tbsp of acidic butter, 2 garlic cloves, and thyme sprigs . Melt the butter over low heat.
Now add the salmon , salt, and pepper , cook over high heat to brown it well. Stir gently with a spatula to avoid breaking it. Now remove the garlic , transfer the salmon to a bowl, and keep warm.
In the same pan, pour the rice and toast for a few minutes. Add the vegetable broth gradually and continue cooking the risotto, stirring often for 15-20 minutes . Once the rice is cooked, turn off the heat and cream with the remaining acidic butter .
The risotto is ready , serve it with the pan-seared salmon and a sprinkle of white pepper .
The salmon risotto keeps for one day in the refrigerator.
You can prepare a double batch of acidic butter and store it in the fridge for other risottos. Alternatively, you can use flavored butter by mixing softened butter with herbs, salt, and lemon zest.
