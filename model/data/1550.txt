To prepare the fried eggplant and prawn rolls, first wash the eggplants, then trim them and cut them into thin, even slices . Place them in a colander and sprinkle with salt . Let them drain for 20 minutes to reduce bitterness.
Meanwhile, clean the shrimp: cut off the head , remove the legs and shell , and use a toothpick to remove the intestine, the dark filament along the back. Transfer the whole, cleaned shrimp to a bowl, and season with oil ,
salt, pepper, and fresh mint leaves . Rinse the eggplants under running water and dry them, then heat a non-stick pan and place the eggplants in it ,
grill them on both sides , then transfer them to a plate and drizzle with a little oil . Everything is ready to assemble the rolls: on a cutting board, place a slice of eggplant, put a shrimp on one side
and wrap the eggplant slice around the shrimp to create a roll . Secure it with a toothpick and set aside.
In a bowl, mix the breadcrumbs and flour , coat the rolls one by one in this mixture , then heat the oil for frying in a pan and, when it reaches 340°F, immerse a few rolls at a time .
Cook for a few minutes, just until they are golden brown . Drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil and serve hot .
The ideal is to eat the rolls hot right away, but if any are left over, you can store them in the fridge for a maximum of one day and reheat them in a pan (or in the oven) before serving.
The scraps from cleaning the shrimp can be used to prepare a tasty bisque!
