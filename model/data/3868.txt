instructions:
To prepare the sole with butter and sage, start by cleaning the soles: clean, skin, and wash the soles, then let them drain and gently pat them dry (for more details on cleaning sole, you can view the cooking school sheet How to clean the sole ). Thoroughly flour the soles on both sides and place them on a plate (1-2). In a non-stick pan, melt the butter over low heat and add the sage leaves ,
then place the soles into the pan (4-5) and let them brown for 3-4 minutes on each side, being careful not to break them when turning them in the pan (if you don't have a sufficiently large pan to cook 4 soles simultaneously, we recommend doing it in two batches). If you notice that the sage leaves are coloring too much during cooking, tending to turn a brownish color, remove them from the heat and set them aside: they will be used to garnish the fish at the end of the preparation. Once cooked, adjust with salt and, if you like, add freshly ground pepper, then place the soles on a serving dish and garnish with sage leaves and melted butter. The sole with butter and sage is ready , serve it and enjoy it immediately.
It is advisable to consume the sole with butter and sage immediately. If necessary, you can still store the soles in the refrigerator for 1 day, closed in an airtight container.
To prevent the butter from burning easily during cooking, you can "clarify" it: melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat and then, as soon as bubbles and a film start to form on the surface, remove them with a skimmer or a spoon. At this point, the butter is clarified and you can use it to cook the soles (for more information on the process of clarifying butter and its uses Clarified butter ).
