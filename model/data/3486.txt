Kids usually go for the cheesy middle while adults appreciate the extra pop from the veggies…definitely a crowd pleaser for mornings, brunches, or whenever.

These work really well for parties, potlucks, and gatherings—just slice, serve, and watch them go! Any combo of vegetables works, and the cheesy layer keeps everything moist and fluffy , kind of like a satisfying, healthy twist on classic savory flans or a simple frittata. Throw it on the table with a basic salad, maybe a warm cup of coffee , and you’ve basically got brunch ready (even on a hectic morning). Since there’s no crust, it’s a little lighter, and being able to change up the veggies means there’s always a way to fit it into family favorites or whatever seasonal produce you have handy.

Every bite reminds folks why these vegetable flans are a great option for any meal, simple or special.
To prepare the vegetable and cheese flans, start by cooking the potatoes with their skin in a pressure cooker for about 15 minutes (or 30/40 minutes boiling them in a regular pot) until they are tender. In the meantime, wash and cut the bell pepper in half, remove the stem and seeds, and dice it into small cubes ; wash the zucchini and cut them into cubes like you did with the bell peppers . Heat 2-3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a pan and sauté the bell peppers for a few minutes, then add the zucchini
and sauté the vegetables for about 10 minutes, until they are cooked but still crispy, season with salt and pepper . Then let the potatoes cool slightly, peel them with a knife, dice them, and mash them with a potato masher (or mash them with a fork) , place them in a bowl, add the bell peppers and zucchini ,
the diced scamorza , the Parmesan , and the egg .
Butter some baking cups and sprinkle them with breadcrumbs , divide the vegetable mixture into the cups, filling them to the brim , sprinkle them with breadcrumbs and add a little extra virgin olive oil. Then bake the flans for 15/20 minutes in the oven at 392 °F until they are hot and golden. Serve the vegetable and cheese flans hot in the cups or unmold them!
Store the vegetable and cheese flans in the refrigerator for 2-3 days in an airtight container. It's possible to freeze the flans if fresh ingredients were used.
You can cook the vegetable and cheese flans in a single buttered dish sprinkled with breadcrumbs!
