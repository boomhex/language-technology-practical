Frittata di Bruscandoli is like a taste of Italian spring. Really. Across Italy, especially in regions like Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and down to Cilento, locals are out there hunting for wild hop shoots, known as bruscandoli. These shoots—sometimes called 'asparagina' or 'viticedda'—bring a fresh twist that makes the frittata really, really special. And look, with Montasio cheese adding a creamy bite, the mix of eggs and hop shoots becomes both simple and savory. It's one of those meals that feels so earthy, you know? Like you're connected to the fields and forests where these wild greens grow.
The wild hop shoot frittata is more than just a dish. For real. It’s about keeping those family traditions alive that make spring feel special every year. In rural areas, these hop shoot frittata recipes pop up in so many forms. While some folks toss the shoots into soups or risottos, the frittata version feels both light and filling—perfect for a picnic or a chill weekend lunch. And in places like Umbria, the hop shoots go by 'luperi,' but the vibe is the same. That classic spring green flavor is something else.
People just love how the bruscandoli frittata recipe turns such a short-lived ingredient into something truly worth waiting for. The egg base? It's moist and slightly fluffy, with the cheese turning golden around the edges. Can't go wrong. It’s a dish that pairs beautifully with rustic bread—maybe a salad—and really, nothing else is needed. So here's the thing, this frittata isn’t just easy to make; it’s a cherished part of Italy’s seasonal frittata traditions that people still, like, totally celebrate today.
To make the bruscandoli omelet, start by washing the shoots under cold running water , then place them on a tray and pat them dry with paper towels . Separate the leaves from the stems
and set them aside , the stems are not used because they are too tough. Chop the rosemary , peel, and chop the shallot .
In a pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil , add the chopped shallot and let it soften over low heat for 5 minutes, then drizzle with a ladle of Vegetable broth . Season with the chopped rosemary .
Continue cooking for a couple of minutes, then add the bruscandoli and pour in another ladle of broth , continue cooking over high heat for another 5 minutes. Once the herbs are tender, turn off the heat and transfer them to a bowl .
In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk , add salt, pepper, and the cooked bruscandoli . Cut the Montasio cheese into small cubes
and add them to the egg mixture (16-17). Now butter and line a 10-inch diameter baking pan with parchment paper ,
pour the egg and bruscandoli mixture into the pan (19-20) and bake the omelet in a preheated static oven for 35 minutes at 356°F (if using a convection oven, bake at 320°F for 25 minutes). Once cooked, remove the bruscandoli omelet from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.
The bruscandoli omelet can be enjoyed freshly made, hot, or warm. It can be stored for up to 2 days in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container. If the ingredients you use are fresh, you can freeze the omelet in cubes, in suitable freezer bags. It can be thawed in the refrigerator and consumed cold or reheated in the oven.
Does baking take too long? You can also make the bruscandoli omelet using the traditional pan method, which is quick and just as tasty! Bruscandoli are wild sprouts that grow spontaneously, ask your trusted greengrocer to find them.
