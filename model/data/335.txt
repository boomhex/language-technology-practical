To prepare the couscous with chickpeas, chicken, and pumpkin, first prepare the Vegetable broth and keep it warm. Peel the pumpkin and remove the seeds. Cut 300 g (10.6 oz) of flesh first into slices and then into cubes . Also, cut the chicken into cubes of about 2 cm (0.8 inches).
Peel the garlic and chop finely ; do the same with the onion . In a large pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat and add the garlic . Choose a pan wide enough to distribute the ingredients well: this way, you will avoid boiling them.
Add the onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. If you notice they are coloring too much, lower the heat slightly. Flavor with the spices: cumin , coriander, paprika, and cinnamon .
Add freshly grated nutmeg . Stir carefully to distribute the flavors and toast the spices for about a minute: they should warm up and become fragrant without burning. Add the chicken cubes to the pan and brown them well on all sides for about 5-7 minutes until golden. Move them only when they detach easily from the bottom: this way, you will get a golden crust that retains the juices. Now add the pumpkin cubes .
Also add the raisins , salt, pepper, and toasted nuts . Stir to mix everything, cover with a lid , and cook over medium-low heat for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally until the pumpkin is tender when pierced with a fork.
Meanwhile, prepare the couscous: put the couscous in a large bowl and pour over the broth that you have brought to a boil . Stir and cover with plastic wrap or a lid. Let stand for about 5 minutes, or until the liquid is completely absorbed. Once the couscous has absorbed the broth, fluff it with a fork .
At this point, the pumpkin and chicken condiment will be cooked , so add it to the bowl along with the precooked chickpeas .
Mix well to combine all the flavors, distributing the chicken, pumpkin, and raisins evenly . Garnish with freshly chopped rosemary and serve your couscous with chickpeas, chicken, and pumpkin immediately !
You can store the couscous with chickpeas, chicken, and pumpkin in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. When serving, you can enjoy it at room temperature or briefly reheat it in a pan with a drizzle of oil or a spoonful of broth to restore softness to the grains. Freezing is not recommended, as it would compromise the texture of the couscous and pumpkin.
For an even more intense flavor, you can lightly toast the couscous in a pan before adding the hot broth: this way, the grains will better absorb the aromas and be more consistent. If you love spicy flavors, add a pinch of chili pepper or a touch of harissa to the spice sauté: they will give the dish a bold and irresistible touch, perfect for enhancing the sweet notes of the pumpkin.
