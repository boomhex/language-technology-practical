instructions:
To prepare the capon broth, first rinse the meat under cold running water to remove any impurities. Then place it in a large pot with the water and bring to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables. Cut the celery into pieces .
Do the same for the carrots . Cut the onions in half and remove the skin .
When the capon cooks, it releases foam, remove it gently with a ladle . Add the sage, rosemary , and bay leaves .
Add the juniper berries , cloves , and onions .
Continue with celery and carrots . Add a handful of coarse salt and bring back to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat to a minimum. During the first 20-30 minutes of cooking, more foam will form on the surface, remove it with the ladle . Partially cover the pot with a lid and cook for at least 4 hours. The longer it cooks, the tastier the broth will be. Remove any foam that forms over time and clean the edges of the pot with a brush. If it reduces too much, you can add more water.
Once cooked, you can serve the capon immediately with the broth ; alternatively, you can strain the broth through a colander or cheesecloth and use only the broth for your preparations and enjoy the boiled capon as a second course.
Once the capon broth has cooled to room temperature, you can store it in the refrigerator in a closed container or covered with plastic wrap for 3-4 days. To keep it longer, transfer it to airtight containers and freeze it.
For a fresh touch, add the zest of an untreated orange or lemon to the broth. If you love intense flavors, you can add fresh ginger or a pinch of turmeric. If you want a more concentrated flavor, once the broth is strained, you can return it to the heat and let some of the water evaporate.
