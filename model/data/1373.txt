instructions:
To prepare the roasted tomato pesto, start by briefly rinsing the tomatoes. After drying them, cut them in half and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, with the cut side facing up. Sprinkle them with salt , sugar, and a bit of oregano, and bake in a preheated static oven at 464°F (240°C) for about 30 minutes .
Don't worry, the parchment paper will look burnt due to the liquids released by the tomatoes . The tomatoes themselves will be dry but still soft and probably with a bit of charred skin. Let them cool slightly before removing them and placing them in the blender . Add the basil leaves ,
then peel, halve the garlic, and remove the core , then add it to the blender along with the grated Parmesan and pine nuts .
Finish by adding a pinch of salt and the oil . Blend until you have a smooth and homogeneous mixture . Your roasted tomato pesto is ready; now you just need to use it as you like !
Roasted tomato pesto can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days, keeping it sealed in a glass jar. If needed, it can also be frozen.
Make small but substantial variations to your roasted tomato pesto. Let's start with the tomatoes: cherry tomatoes will be more flavorful, plum tomatoes more acidic, and yellow ones... well, why not try them! Almonds or hazelnuts instead of pine nuts for a different nutty note, and finally Pecorino for a more intense savory flavor. If you want to cross the border, sprinkle the tomatoes with a pinch of smoked paprika, which will perfectly complement the roasted flavor of the tomatoes!
