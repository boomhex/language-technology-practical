When you think of Italian comfort food, you gotta try this potato and mortadella pie from Emilia-Romagna . Seriously, it's the perfect example of how folks up in northern Italy whip up something special with whatever's hanging around in the fridge. And look, this savory potato pie —it’s all about those layers. Thinly sliced potatoes with loads of mortadella (you know, Bologna’s famous sausage) and whatever cheese you’ve got. Really, it is amazing. As it bakes, those potatoes turn golden and the mortadella just melts right in, creating this incredible mix of tender veggies with a crispy top. Perfect for family gatherings or a chill aperitivo. Everyone just grabbing a slice—so good.
In central Italy, you might bump into versions with zucchini, eggplant, or even tuna—whatever needs using up, really. So, so flexible. Some might say it’s like Gattò di Patate from Naples, but this one’s simpler. It lets the mortadella really, really shine. Nothing too fancy, just a classic Italian potato pie that’s homestyle and, to be honest, a bit nostalgic. That moist inside from the cheese and potatoes? Every bite is rich and satisfying. And the mortadella? It adds a savory punch that’s honestly hard to beat. Kids love it, adults love it. It fits right into any casual meal.
This dish is a win when you need something filling and fun to throw together. Plus, here's the thing—since it’s all about using leftovers, no two pies come out the same. Keeps it interesting, you know? So, grab what you’ve got, layer it up, and let that savory potato pie remind you why Italian home cooking is all about making something delicious from the simplest ingredients. That’s the magic of a good potato and mortadella pie —simple, tasty, and, pretty much, always welcome at the table.
