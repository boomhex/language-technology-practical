instructions:
The baumkuchen cake is a real showstopper. Seriously, it's famous for its ringed slices that look just like tree rings. Known as the " German tree cake ," it's super popular not only in Germany but also in Austria and even Japan. And here's the thing: what makes it really unique is its layered baking method. Each tender layer is carefully built up. For real, it's either on a rotating spit for that authentic touch or using an oven grill if you're doing it at home.
Now, let's talk about the batter—marzipan adds this nutty sweetness to every bite. Slice it open, and you see those golden layers all stacked up, topped with a sleek dark chocolate coating. Honestly, the baumkuchen recipe will wow your friends—no need for fancy tools. You can create a homemade version that looks really really spectacular.
Unlike most cakes, this layered cake recipe requires some extra time and patience, but that's the fun part, you know? In Austria, you might find bakers adding a splash of rum or a touch of citrus zest. And in Japan, the baumkuchen cake is so beloved, it's often given as gifts at weddings and parties. Pretty much a big deal.
Each bite offers a tasty combo of moist cake and a crispy chocolate shell—way way better than your typical sponge cake, thanks to that marzipan. It's not just about taste; those rings are always a conversation starter. For anyone curious about baumkuchen history or eager to try a traditional German dessert that stands out, this recipe is a delight to eat. With so many baumkuchen variations around the globe, there's room to add your own twist, but those classic rings? They’re iconic.
To prepare the baumkuchen, start by separating the egg yolks from the whites into two separate bowls (for the recipe, you need 175 g of egg whites and 100 g of yolks, which correspond to about 5 medium eggs). Then preheat the oven to 465°F in grill mode and start cutting the marzipan into coarse cubes , then pour them into the bowl of a stand mixer along with the powdered sugar and the seeds you have extracted from a vanilla pod .
Add the softened butter cut into cubes and work everything with the paddle attachment at medium speed for a few minutes. Meanwhile, start whisking the egg whites by gradually adding the sugar ,
until you get a white and firm mixture . At this point, pour the yolks into the mixer little by little , and when they are fully absorbed, add the flour , wait another 1-2 minutes and turn off the machine.
Mix with a spatula to ensure all the ingredients are perfectly combined and start adding the egg whites little by little , mixing from bottom to top so as not to deflate the batter .
Take your 8-inch cake pan and line the base, previously buttered, with a circle of parchment paper . At this point, place two tablespoons of batter and spread them to cover the entire surface .
Once the oven has reached temperature, bake the first layer of your baumkuchen for 1-2 minutes until a golden crust has formed . Then take it out and spread another layer of batter on top, again 2 tablespoons , spreading it with the back of the spoon over the entire surface . Put it back in the oven for the same time and temperature as previously indicated. And continue like this for all the layers;
once you make the last layer , lower the oven to 355°F (in static mode) and, after spreading the last layer of batter well, bake for 20 minutes. As soon as you finish baking, take the cake out of the oven and let it cool slightly. Using a small knife, gently detach the edges of the cake and turn it upside down on a cooling rack .
Remove the parchment paper by pulling it gently and let the baumkuchen cool completely. Then sift the apricot jam through a sieve and mix it with the Grand Marnier .
At this point, use the jam to brush the surface of the cake and place it in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes. While the cake is in the fridge, prepare the glaze: start by chopping the chocolate and melt it in a double boiler .
Once it has completely melted, add the coconut oil and let it melt completely . Take the bowl out of the hot water and continue stirring the chocolate from time to time until it has cooled, then pour it over the cake
covering the sides well too . Smooth it out with a spatula and let it set in the refrigerator for an hour. At this point, the chocolate will have solidified, and you can enjoy your baumkuchen !
Baumkuchen can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Coconut oil can be found in ethnic stores or well-stocked supermarkets; if you can't find it, you can use the same amount of regular butter! If you prefer, you can flavor the baumkuchen with orange or lemon zest!
