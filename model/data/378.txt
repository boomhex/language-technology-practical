instructions:
To prepare the coconut and apple cake, first remove the core from the apples , peel them , and slice them thinly .
Collect them in a bowl, then add the juice of half a lemon ; mix to ensure the juice coats the apple slices evenly, so they do not turn brown . Set aside .
In another bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder , then add the coconut flour and sugar . Mix and set aside.
In another bowl, break the eggs, then add the sunflower oil and milk . Mix with a manual whisk until you obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Incorporate the dry ingredients into the liquids , gradually, mixing with a spatula . The result should be a smooth and lump-free batter .
Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper and pour the batter inside . Arrange the apple slices in a radial pattern on top and bake in a static oven at 356°F for 55-60 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Dust with powdered sugar and serve your coconut and apple cake !
Store the coconut and apple cake at room temperature, preferably under a glass dome, for 2-3 days at most. The cake can be frozen after baking.
You can replace the powdered sugar with shredded coconut.
To enhance the apple flavor, you can add one apple, diced, to the batter.
