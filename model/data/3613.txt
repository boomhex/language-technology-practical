instructions:
To prepare the eggplant caviar, wash the eggplants under plenty of fresh running water, then dry them. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper without piercing them . Bake in a static oven preheated to 356°F for at least 60 minutes (or at 320°F for 50 minutes if in a convection oven). After this time , remove the eggplants from the oven, and with a knife, remove the skin and
with a spoon, scoop out the flesh inside them . Place the obtained flesh on a fine-mesh strainer and press it down with the back of a spoon ,
so that it releases the excess liquid (alternatively, you can also use a cotton or linen cloth). Put the flesh in a food processor equipped with blades and add the crushed garlic and the oil .
Season with salt and also add the mint leaves , then blend until you get a thick and homogeneous puree .
Transfer everything into a small bowl , then squeeze the juice of half a lemon and add it to the puree you obtained .
Finally, add the paprika and mix with whisks to blend the ingredients well : your eggplant caviar is ready to be served , accompanied by fresh vegetables or spread on crunchy crostini.
You can store the eggplant caviar for a maximum of 3-4 days covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container.
For this recipe, purple and round eggplants are perfect, as they have sweeter flesh. As an alternative to mint, you can use fresh basil, or chopped coriander or parsley, to vary the taste of the caviar depending on the dish you want to pair it with.
