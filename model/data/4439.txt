Risotto with cheese, pepper, and figs is a first course that represents a harmonious blend between tradition and culinary innovation, with opposing flavors that merge into a perfect balance of savoriness and sweetness. Cacio e Pepe spaghetti is a dish known worldwide that over time has been interpreted in numerous creative variations, maintaining the essence of simplicity and Roman tradition. Risotto with cheese, pepper, and figs is one of the more intriguing reinterpretations, where each ingredient contributes to creating a dish that is much more than the sum of its parts. Carnaroli rice is perfect for its ability to slowly release starch during cooking, allowing for a creamy and enveloping texture. The arrival of figs halfway through cooking is the moment when the dish truly comes to life as they blend perfectly with the rice, gradually releasing their natural sweetness that contrasts with the savoriness and strong flavor of Pecorino Romano. Freshly ground black pepper introduces a pungent note that perfectly balances the dish. Perfect for any occasion, it will conquer even the most refined palates.
