instructions:
To prepare beef carpaccio with arugula and parmesan, start with the citronette sauce; squeeze the lemons and place the filtered juice in a bowl : add the oil ,
salt, and ground pepper (4-5), then emulsify the sauce with the help of a whisk .
Once ready , put the sauce in a dispenser. Arrange the arugula on a serving plate, distributing it evenly , cut the meat into very thin slices with the help of a slicer, and distribute it over the arugula .
Add the cheese shavings , then finish with the citronette sauce and some lemon slices. Finally, you can serve and enjoy your beef carpaccio with arugula and parmesan .

It is recommended to consume beef carpaccio with arugula and parmesan immediately. You can store it for up to one day.
Want to add an extra kick to your citronette sauce? Try adding a tablespoon of mustard or mayonnaise.
Additionally, if you prefer, you can let the meat marinate with the sauce for about ten minutes (or more, according to taste) in the refrigerator: however, proceeding in this way, the meat will lose its natural pink color, turning into the color of cooked meat. After the marination time, remove the carpaccio from the refrigerator, add the arugula, the parmesan shavings, and serve by bringing oil, pepper, and salt to the table so that guests can add more seasoning if they wish!
For the safe consumption of raw meat, it is recommended to purchase very fresh meat and not consume it if you notice changes in color or odor. For further information, refer to the guidelines from the Ministry of Health .
