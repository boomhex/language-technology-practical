Sweetbreads with Marsala is a traditional dish from Lazio. The preparation of sweetbreads requires some careful attention during the cleaning phase. Soak the sweetbreads in lukewarm water, changing the water twice every 15 minutes. During this phase, try to remove the membranes and the bloody parts, resulting in very white pieces. Cut the sweetbreads into slices not too thin, lightly flour them, and sauté in butter, then add the Marsala. Once it has evaporated, add a few tablespoons of broth and finish the cooking. Serve the Sweetbreads with Marsala by placing a slice on a piece of bread fried in butter and drizzling with the cooking sauce.
