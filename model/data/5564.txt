To prepare sautéed zucchini, wash and trim the zucchini, then dry them and cut them into thin slices, 2 mm (1/16 inch) thick. Place the oil and garlic in a non-stick pan, add the zucchini, salt, and pepper, and cook over high heat for about 8 minutes.
Stir the zucchini occasionally by shaking the pan or gently stirring, to avoid breaking them. Meanwhile, wash, dry, and finely chop a bunch of parsley. When the zucchini is cooked, turn off the heat and remove the garlic.
Flavor with chopped parsley, stir gently, and serve the sautéed zucchini immediately.
Sautéed zucchini can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. You can freeze them after cooking.
