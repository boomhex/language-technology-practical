instructions:
To prepare the orange pork loin, first obtain the zest and juice from about 1 kg of oranges: you will need 10 g of zest and 450 g of juice. Prepare the marinade: place the rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, peppercorns, and 2 tablespoons of oil (taken from the total amount) in a bowl, then add the grated orange zest and half of the squeezed juice . Add the meat to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours . Every 30 minutes, turn the meat in the bowl to ensure that all sides are in contact with the marinade.
After this time, remove the meat from the marinade and set the liquid aside. If necessary, tie the pork loin with string to give it a regular shape . In a large skillet, melt the butter in the remaining oil over low heat, then add the meat, raise the heat, and sear it on all sides for a total of about 10 minutes .
After searing all sides, deglaze with white wine and let it evaporate completely, then pour in the remaining orange juice and the reserved marinade .
Cover with a lid and cook for 3 hours on medium-low heat , turning the meat occasionally and basting it with the cooking juices . At the end of the cooking time, adjust the salt. When ready to serve, slice the orange pork loin and drizzle it with the cooking juices !
The orange pork loin can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container.
You can freeze it after cooking, either sliced or whole.
If you wish to thicken the accompanying sauce, you can add 20 g of cornstarch to the cooking juices during the last few minutes.
You can adjust the amount of herbs according to your preference!
