instructions:
To make glazed turnips, first wash the turnips under running water , then dry them and cut them in half to slice them more easily; you should obtain slices about 1/4 inch thick .
Transfer the sliced turnips to a large bowl, pour in the 5 oz of honey , drizzle with olive oil , and season with the powdered spices. Mustard
Ginger , cumin , and paprika .
Fragrant with thyme leaves , then salt and pour the water .
Stir to flavor the turnips well, then transfer them to a baking dish and pour the remaining 0.2 oz of honey over the entire surface . Cook the turnips in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 35-40 minutes, occasionally drizzling the turnip surface with the cooking juice. Once the cooking is finished, remove the honey and spice glazed turnips from the oven , let them cool slightly, and then serve them accompanying meat or fish main courses.
Honey glazed turnips can be stored in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for about 3 days. We do not recommend freezing.
For glazing the turnips, you can use chestnut honey if you want to give a stronger flavor. As an alternative to sweet paprika, you can use hot paprika if you prefer its taste.
