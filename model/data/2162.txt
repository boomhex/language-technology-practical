instructions:
To prepare the stir-fried soybean sprouts, first peel the ginger and cut it into strips ; then remove the chili pepper stem and slice it into rings, leaving the seeds inside .
Heat the wok well over high flame, and once it's scorching, pour in the vegetable oil and then add the ginger and chili pepper . Let the ginger and chili pepper brown for a minute, stirring occasionally, then add the soybean sprouts and stir-fry for a couple of minutes, stirring constantly.
Pour in the soy sauce and let it evaporate; once the soy sauce has evaporated, sprinkle the sprouts with water and finish stir-frying them, for a total of about 6 minutes of cooking. Your tasty stir-fried soybean sprouts are ready to be served !
You can store the stir-fried soybean sprouts in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to one day. Freezing is not recommended.
Enrich the stir-fried soybean sprouts with a crunchy note, like toasted cashews, or a sweet one, for example with dried fruit! If you want, you can transform this tasty side dish into a light main course by adding some pre-cooked noodles and stir-frying them together with the sprouts.
By soybean sprouts, we mean not only the sprouts with a yellowish outgrowth, but also commonly those with a green outgrowth: the latter are mung bean sprouts, also known as green soy or green azuki.
