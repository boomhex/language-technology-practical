So, go ahead—try your hand at making this charming dessert that combines elegance and simplicity in every slice. Seriously good.
To prepare the sweet crepe cake, start by preparing the crepes that will be the structure of your dessert: put the previously sifted flour in a high-sided bowl, granulated sugar, seeds from half a vanilla bean or a sachet of vanilla extract, a pinch of salt, and the milk. Work the mixture with a hand whisk or an electric mixer until it is smooth, velvety, and without lumps . In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with a fork, then add them to the other ingredients and continue mixing. Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat and let it cool, then add it to the crepe batter and mix thoroughly. Finally, add the grated orange peel to the batter .
Mix the ingredients well to obtain a dense batter without lumps . Cover the batter with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least half an hour . After the necessary resting time, take your batter from the fridge and start creating your crepes: heat a crepe pan or a non-stick pan with a diameter of 8 inches. Melt a small knob of butter and spread it over the entire surface of the pan with the help of kitchen paper. Then pour a small ladle of batter into the center of the pan .
Using the ladle or a spoon, quickly and carefully spread the batter over the entire surface of the pan . Let it cook for a minute, lifting the edges of the crepe from time to time with a crepe spreader or a wooden spatula to detach it from the surface; as soon as it is golden, turn it over and wait for it to take on the same color . Once ready, remove it from the pan by sliding it onto a plate, and continue the same way with the remaining crepes, stacking them on top of each other as they are ready . Cover them with kitchen paper and set them aside.
Now move on to the creams for the filling. For the yogurt cream: in a bowl, put 500 g of Greek yogurt and add the sifted powdered sugar , mix to combine the ingredients , then cut the half vanilla bean and add the seeds , then mix the mixture.
For the strawberry cream: proceed as for the yogurt cream, then put 500 g of Greek yogurt in a bowl and add the sifted powdered sugar, mixing the ingredients. At this point, wash the strawberries, remove the green stem with a small knife, and blend them until you obtain a fine pulp that you will filter with a fine-mesh strainer . Now add the filtered pulp to the Greek yogurt and mix thoroughly with a spatula or spoon .
Now prepare the fruit for the filling: wash the strawberries, remove the stem and cut them into cubes . Peel the peaches with a small knife , cut them in half to remove the pit, and then cut them into cubes . Do the same for the apricots.
Now you can start assembling your cake: take a serving plate and spread a little yogurt cream on the bottom of the plate so that the base crepe doesn't slide . Place the first crepe and spread about two tablespoons of white yogurt cream .
Add a tablespoon of fruit cubes and distribute them over the entire surface, then cover the layer with another crepe . Then spread this crepe with about 2 tablespoons of strawberry cream and distribute the fruit cubes as for the previous layer.
Then proceed in the same way (25-26), alternating the yogurt and strawberry creams until you finish the cake composition with the last crepe layer .
When you have finished the layers, move on to preparing the cream for the garnish: in a bowl, put 100 g of Greek yogurt and dilute it with fresh liquid cream ; then add the sifted powdered sugar and mix with a spoon until you obtain a fluid cream .
With a spoon, slowly pour the obtained cream over the top of the cake starting from the center . Now you can decorate the cake by placing whole cherries and strawberries on top and adding mint leaves to give a scenic touch to your sweet crepe cake .
The sweet crepe cake can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days covered with plastic wrap. Freezing is not recommended.
Yogurt or cream, that is the question. Cream is a fantastic alternative; however, if you want to stay true to yogurt, know that you can replace Greek yogurt with plain yogurt. The aspect on which you can unleash yourself without restraint is the fruit: any fruit is fine, including canned fruit (after you've drained it well).
