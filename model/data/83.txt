instructions:
To prepare linguine with ricotta and radicchio, start with the latter: remove the outer, tough leaves, then wash and cut it into strips . In a pan, pour a drizzle of oil and a clove of garlic. Let it flavor on low heat, then add the radicchio and cook on medium-high heat for 5-6 minutes. When the radicchio is wilted, deglaze with orange juice .
Season with salt and let it evaporate . Continue cooking for another 3-4 minutes until the radicchio is tender .
Cook the linguine in plenty of salted water and drain it al dente , reserving some cooking water. Transfer the pasta to the pan with the radicchio and add a ladle of cooking water .
Sauté everything , then add the ricotta and mix well . You should obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream; if necessary, add a bit more pasta cooking water.
Now plate up by placing some radicchio on top of the linguine , then finish with grated orange zest , freshly ground black pepper, and a drizzle of oil if you like. The linguine with ricotta and radicchio are ready, serve them immediately !
We recommend serving linguine with ricotta and radicchio as soon as they are ready. However, if there are leftovers, they can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
For a gourmet touch, complete the dish with coarsely chopped toasted walnuts: they add crunchiness and a scent that pairs wonderfully with the sweetness of the ricotta and the character of the radicchio. If you use rustic ricotta, you can sieve it to obtain a smoother cream.
