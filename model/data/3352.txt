Carciofi e salame su crackers alle olive is a seriously tasty snack that really really captures the core of Liguria, nestled in the northwest part of Italy. And look, this beautiful region? Folks adore bold , tender vegetables and full-flavored meats. This artichoke and salami appetizer ? It combines both in the best way possible. You know, the artichokes are cooked in that classic trifolati style, making them moist and melt-in-your-mouth good with a hint of garlic and parsley. And the salami? It’s salame di Sant’Olcese —from Genoa with a coarse texture and subtle garlic flavor—perfect match, for sure. Layer everything on top of crunchy, crispy olive crackers, and you’ve got a bite that's salty, savory, and a bit tangy from the olives. Really good stuff.
In Liguria, some people even mix up the artichokes or the type of olives in their olive crackers recipe —everyone has their own twist. But, what stays constant? That combo of golden sautéed veggies, tender meat, and sturdy crackers that can handle all the toppings. It’s one of those Italian appetizer ideas perfect for hanging out. Maybe with a glass of local white wine or some bubbly. I mean, people love it because you get a lot of flavor in a single bite. Pretty simple. The artichokes and salami perfectly balance each other. It’s a go-to for easy antipasto recipes when you’re short on time but still want something special. You’ll find this sort of snack at big family gatherings or as a little afternoon treat.
When it comes to savory cracker toppings , Liguria does it right: using simple, fresh ingredients that let the flavors shine. Plus, a texture that’s just as crucial as the taste. Whether you’re having a casual get-together or just enjoying a quiet moment, this appetizer is a surefire way to bring a touch of Ligurian tradition to your table. And here's the thing—can't go wrong with that!
To prepare the appetizers with sautéed artichokes and Sant'Olcese salami, start by cleaning the artichokes, slicing them into thin wedges, and placing them in a container with water and lemon to prevent them from turning black. Prepare the vegetable broth with which you will moisten the artichokes whenever they become too dry during cooking. Chop the garlic into small pieces and place them in a pan with oil, add the well-drained artichokes and sauté for a moment. Now, add the chopped basil , keeping a few leaves aside for garnishing at the end.
Moisten with broth and let cook for 15 minutes. Slice the salami and place it on the classic olive crackers “La Bottega di Olivia&Marino” topping each with an artichoke wedge. Sprinkle each cracker with chopped basil.
