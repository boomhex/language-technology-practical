instructions:
To prepare the spaghetti with clams and lemon, first ensure that the clams are well purged. To do this, soak them for 2 hours in salted water, then shake them to check for sand. Here you can find all the details on how to clean the clams. Take a bunch of parsley and separate the stems from the leaves. Finely chop them and set aside. Without peeling the garlic, crush it with the flat side of a knife. Transfer it to a large pan along with the parsley stems and a drizzle of oil . Heat gently to infuse flavor.
Then add the purged clams , deglaze with white wine , and cover with a lid . Cook until they are fully open.
Strain the obtained liquid , then shell a good portion of the clams . At this point, cook the spaghetti in unsalted boiling water for about 3 minutes.
Pour a portion of the strained liquid into the same pan used earlier . Transfer the spaghetti into the pan and finish cooking by allowing the pasta to absorb the liquid. If needed, add hot water .
If it doesn't taste flavorful enough, you can use the remaining clam liquid . Add the clams and the chopped parsley .
Grate the zest of a lemon and toss the pasta well. Use tongs and a ladle to form a nest of spaghetti and place it on the plate. Add some clams and serve .
We recommend serving the spaghetti with clams and lemon immediately.
Enhance the clam sauté by adding a chili pepper, or finish with a grind of pepper!
