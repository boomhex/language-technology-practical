instructions:
For marble chocolate tempering, the first thing you need is a thermometer and melt the chocolate. You can choose to do it in the microwave or with the bain-marie method that we will show you. Place a pot with water on the stove and put a mixing bowl on top . The water should not boil too much; otherwise, it may evaporate and fall into the chocolate. Then pour the chocolate chips or coarsely chopped chocolate inside and stir until it melts .
Using a thermometer, check that it has reached a temperature between 122 and 131°F . At this point, carefully dry the bottom of the mixing bowl and transfer the chocolate onto clean and perfectly dry marble . With the help of two spatulas, push the chocolate on the marble , spreading it and collecting it back towards the center to cool the cocoa butter.
You will notice that gradually the chocolate will become shiny and thicker . Measure the temperature from time to time , and as soon as it reaches 84°F, transfer it into a bowl using the two spatulas .
Mix the chocolate and heat it again in the microwave (a few seconds, stir and measure the temperature again) or in a bain-marie until it reaches a temperature of 88°F, ideal for working. The chocolate is now tempered, transfer it into a piping bag and use it immediately for your preparations, we show you some examples.
After tempering the dark chocolate, transfer it into a bar mold, filling it to the brim . Move the mold, gently tapping it to eliminate any air bubbles and wait a few seconds before adding the nuts .
Refrigerate for 10 minutes, then transfer to a cool, dry place and let it solidify completely . You will notice that the top part of the mold will become opaque, which means the chocolate is well crystallized, and you will just need to turn the mold over to extract the bars . The homemade chocolate bars are ready .
As soon as the tempering phase is over, we recommend using the melted chocolate immediately.
Similarly, you can also temper white chocolate and milk chocolate. Only the temperatures of the 3 phases to be respected will change.
Milk Chocolate
melting temperature: 113-122°F
spreading temperature: 80-82°F
reheating temperature: 84-86°F

White Chocolate
melting temperature: 113-122°F
spreading temperature: 79-81°F
reheating temperature: 82-84°F
Chocolate is an ingredient obtained from processing cocoa beans, which are extracted from a fruit called cabossa, found inside the cocoa tree.
The territorial origin is fundamental because the soil contributes to the development of aroma precursors. The % indicated on the bar is important as it shows the amount of cocoa beans used in it. What remains usually, in the case of a dark chocolate bar, is composed of sugar, vanilla, and lecithin. There are 4 fundamental parameters to recognize good chocolate:
