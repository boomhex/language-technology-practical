instructions:
To prepare the baked skewers, first soak 12-14 wooden skewers in water to prevent them from burning in the oven. Now take the veal and cut it into 3/4 inch chunks , then do the same with the chicken and the sausage .
Clean the bell peppers, removing the stem and seeds. First, slice them into strips and then into cubes the same size as the meat .
Now you can start assembling the skewers: take the first wooden skewer, start with a piece of bell pepper, then add a piece of meat of your choice . Continue this way, alternating the bell peppers and different types of meat . Altogether, you will have 12-14 skewers. Arrange them on two baking sheets lined with parchment paper and drizzle them with a bit of oil .
Season with salt , pepper , and paprika .
Finally, add the rosemary sprigs . Bake in a static oven at 356°F (180°C) for 20 minutes, then for the last 5 minutes, raise the temperature to 392°F (200°C) and turn on the grill. Take them out and serve your baked skewers hot !
You can store the skewers in the refrigerator for one day before cooking them, or if you've used all fresh ingredients, you can freeze them. You can store the cooked skewers for 1-2 days in the fridge, well covered.
To get softer baked skewers, you can marinate them first with oil, wine, and spices.
Choose from these cuts of veal: topside, silverside, rump, or topside cap.
To make the skewers even tastier, you can also add a piece of bacon, which will release some fat.
