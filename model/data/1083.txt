To prepare the coffee and milk plumcake, make the coffee with the moka pot in the required quantity. In a bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer until the mixture is light and fluffy. Pour in the oil
and continue beating briefly . Then add the milk and the coffee at room temperature .
Mix for a few more moments with the mixer . Incorporate the flour and the baking powder all at once.
Mix all the ingredients, still using the mixer, until you get a smooth and lump-free batter: it will be quite liquid . Transfer the mixture into a 9x5 inch loaf pan. We used a silicone one, if you prefer to use a classic pan we recommend oiling and flouring it before pouring the batter inside. Bake the plumcake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 40-45 minutes. Before removing from the oven, do the toothpick test to make sure the cake is well cooked inside. Once taken out of the oven , let it cool slightly.
Then remove it from the pan onto a wire rack and decorate the plumcake with powdered sugar , before serving it .
The coffee and milk plumcake keeps under a glass dome at room temperature for 3-4 days. Alternatively, it can be frozen.
To make the plumcake tastier, you can add chocolate shavings or grated chocolate to the batter; chocolate chips are not recommended because the batter is very soft and they might settle at the bottom. You can also dust the cake with cocoa powder. If you want to add cocoa powder to enhance the coffee flavor, substitute it for 0.88 oz of flour.
