instructions:
To prepare the seafood parmigiana, first start with the eggplants: wash them and remove the stem , then slice them thinly, about 1/8 inch thick . Meanwhile, heat the seed oil in a large pot. Flour the eggplants .
When the oil reaches 340°F, immerse the floured eggplant slices . Fry for a few minutes until golden , then drain them on a tray lined with absorbent paper .
Now prepare the herb breadcrumbs: in a mixer, add the breadcrumbs, oregano , and basil leaves . Blend everything together and set aside. Move on to the mollusks: in a pan, heat the oil with garlic and parsley stems . Let it infuse for a few moments.
Add the How to Clean and Open Mussels and the How to clean clams . Cover with a lid and cook on high heat until the shells open .
Once ready, drain them through a sieve , being careful to save the cooking liquid . Shell the mussels and clams .
Strain the cooking liquid from the mussels and clams and collect it in a pan , then bring it to a boil and add the tomato sauce , salt, and pepper . Cook for 20 minutes without the lid.
Take the How to clean shrimp and cut them into chunks . Everything is ready to assemble the parmigiana: take a 10x7 inch baking dish, spread a layer of sauce on the bottom , then place the fried eggplants and cover again with tomato sauce.
Continue with a layer of mussels, clams, and shrimp , then sprinkle with herb breadcrumbs . Continue with another layer of eggplants and sauce and alternate the layers in the same way until all ingredients are used up.
Finish the last layer with breadcrumbs and a drizzle of olive oil . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 25 minutes. Remove your seafood parmigiana from the oven, let it cool slightly, then serve it garnished with fresh basil leaves !
The seafood parmigiana can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
You can freeze it after cooking if you used fresh ingredients.
We recommend discarding any mussels and clams that do not open during cooking.
