instructions:
To prepare beer and speck risotto, start by peeling the white onion, then finely chop it and set it aside. Wash the parsley and finely chop it with a knife . Now take the slice of speck and cut it into very small cubes .
Place a large pan on the heat, melt the butter, and then add the chopped onion , let the onion soften for at least 10 minutes, then add the speck cubes and stir with a spoon to flavor them. Sauté the speck for a few minutes, then take out a spoonful of cubes and set them aside (they will be used to garnish the finished dish).
Add the rice and toast it until it becomes translucent, then add the dark beer a little at a time , until it's used up, letting it absorb each time before adding more. Once the beer has been absorbed, pour in a ladle of broth and continue until cooking is complete, taking care to add a little broth as needed to prevent the rice from drying out too much.
When the rice is al dente, add the ricotta , stir to melt it, it should make the rice creamy. Once cooked, turn off the heat, add flavor with the chopped parsley , and serve your beer and speck risotto hot!
It is advisable to consume the beer and speck risotto right away; if any leftovers remain, you can store them in the refrigerator for a couple of days in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
The choice of soft cheese to add to the risotto can be subjective; however, it is important to opt for a cheese with a very delicate flavor, such as robiola or mascarpone.
