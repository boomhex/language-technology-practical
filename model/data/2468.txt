To make the dark chocolate and peanut Easter egg, start with the How to temper of the chocolate: chop the dark chocolate , melt it in a bain-marie (it's preferable that the water in the saucepan does not touch the bottom of the bowl where you put the chocolate); measure the temperature with a kitchen thermometer and when the chocolate reaches a temperature of 129°F, dry the bottom of the saucepan (you can leave the boiling water in the saucepan) and pour 2/3 of it onto a marble slab placed on a worktop (the marble slab has a lower temperature than the worktop, making it suitable for cooling the chocolate quickly).
Start working the chocolate on the marble slab with a spatula and scraper , spreading it over the surface. When it reaches 82°F (always measure with the kitchen thermometer) , transfer it to a bowl where you left the remaining 1/3 of chocolate and mix: the chocolate should reach 88/90°F . If at any stage the temperature drops too low, always keep the saucepan with the hot water bath handy to slightly warm the chocolate. Conversely, if it's still too hot, repeat the marble spreading operation with a small portion of the chocolate.
Pour the tempered chocolate into a 10-inch Easter egg mold ; distribute the chocolate to the edges by rotating the mold. Then, after 1 minute, flip the mold onto a tray and let the excess chocolate drip out. Tap the mold lightly to eliminate air bubbles; collect all the excess chocolate and put it back in the bowl. Flip it back and wait about 20 minutes for it to crystallize ; then with a scraper remove the chocolate peaks to level the edges .
While the chocolate sets, combine the roasted peanuts with the chocolate collected in the bowl and mix with a spatula. Wait 10-20 minutes and use a scraper to remove the peaks again if necessary. Pour the chocolate with peanuts into the two halves of the mold and redistribute with a circular motion. Wait 1 minute, then flip the mold to remove the excess . Wait about 20 minutes, then again remove the peaks with a scraper to level the edges if necessary. Wait 3 to 6 hours to allow the chocolate to crystallize well. If the temperature exceeds 68°F, you can set the chocolate in the refrigerator.
When the chocolate is well set, unmold the eggs by slightly twisting the mold and gently flipping it onto the work surface . Lightly heat a large pan, then turn off the heat and move it to the work surface. Place one egg half at a time with the edges on the bottom of the pan; wait a few moments for the edges to warm slightly, then insert the surprise into the egg and join the halves; hold in place for a few minutes to adhere the two halves. Your dark chocolate and peanut Easter egg is ready to be gifted and enjoyed on Easter Day!
The dark chocolate and peanut Easter egg can be stored in a cool, dry place for 30 days, away from direct light.
The ideal chocolate for making perfect Easter eggs is couverture chocolate, preferably 70%, and with a good quantity and quality of cocoa butter.
