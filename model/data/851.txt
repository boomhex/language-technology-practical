Keep them in a bowl with water and lemon juice to prevent them from darkening . Meanwhile, cut the prosciutto into strips , and place it in a very hot pan .
Brown it well over high heat. When it is crispy , place it on a plate with absorbent paper and set it aside. Heat a drizzle of oil in the same pan
add the artichokes and cook them over high heat (it will take about 6-7 minutes) and salt them. When they are well colored , turn off the heat and set them aside. Meanwhile, the potatoes will have cooked, remove them from the oven and keep them at room temperature.
Start cooking the risotto. In a saucepan, heat a drizzle of oil , add the rice , and toast it for a few minutes. Deglaze with a ladle of vegetable broth
Add ¾ of the artichokes, keeping the rest for serving. Continue cooking the rice for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding a ladle of broth each time the rice starts to dry out , salt to taste .
When cooking is complete, turn off the heat and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper . Cream with butter , Parmesan , and stir.
Finish by adding the roasted potatoes and gently mix . Plate your rice and top with some artichoke wedges, potato slices, and crispy prosciutto. Your risotto with artichokes and potatoes is ready to be served hot!
