instructions:
To prepare the concord grape fritters, beat the egg yolks with the sugar in a bowl using a whisk, and gradually add the milk, salt, and brandy. Add the flour, cinnamon, and yeast without forming lumps, and mix until you get a soft cream. Beat the egg whites until stiff and add them to the previously obtained cream, and finally add the washed and dried concord grape berries. Heat the seed oil and dip spoonfuls of the cream with the concord grape berries: let the fritters turn golden and then let them drain on absorbent paper. Serve them while still hot.
Sprinkle the concord grape fritters with plenty of powdered sugar mixed with a pinch of cinnamon powder.
