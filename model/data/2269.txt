To prepare the potato baskets filled with salmon, start with the basket shells. Take the potatoes and after washing and drying them, peel them . Then, using a large-holed grater, grate them and place them in a large bowl. Break the egg into a small bowl, add salt and pepper, then beat it with a fork.
Add the egg to the potatoes . Then also add the grated cheese and hazelnut flour . Mix the ingredients well with a spoon until you get a homogeneous mixture.
Pour the mixture into 6 silicone molds with a capacity of 3.5 oz each . Press the mixture well along the edges of the mold using a spoon: the mixture should take the shape of the mold and remain hollow inside. Once prepared , bake them in a preheated static oven at 425°F for 20 minutes (or in a convection oven at 390°F for 10 minutes). While your baskets are baking, prepare the cheese mousse for the filling: finely chop the mint, leaving some whole leaves for the final decoration .
Then place the Philadelphia in a bowl, add salt and pepper. Afterward, add the chopped mint leaves and mix all the ingredients well . Transfer the mixture into a piping bag and set aside. Then proceed to the salmon: remove the bones using kitchen tweezers and the skin, if present, with the blade of a knife.
Cut the salmon into strips and then into cubes about 0.4 inches on each side . Heat the oil in a non-stick pan and brown the garlic . Sear the salmon for about 2-3 minutes, until it forms a light crust on the surface. Add salt and pepper. Finally, remove the garlic and let the salmon cool, if you prefer, placing it in a bowl.
At this point, your potato baskets will be ready: remove them from the oven and let them cool. When they reach room temperature, remove them from the molds and place them on a plate . Fill them with the cheese cream .
Decorate with salmon cubes and mint leaves . Your potato baskets filled with salmon are ready to be served !
