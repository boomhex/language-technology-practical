To prepare the coffee bean cookies, start by preparing the coffee. Meanwhile, pour the butter into the bowl of a stand mixer (or if you don't have a stand mixer, into a regular bowl to work with an electric mixer). Add the sugar and mix until you obtain a smooth and creamy mixture. While still blending, add the liquid coffee and the coffee powder .
In a separate bowl, sift the flour and cocoa powder . Then insert the paddle attachment in the stand mixer and gradually add the flour mixed with cocoa powder . Mix until you get a compact dough, which you will transfer onto a work surface .
Knead it with your hands, forming a solid and homogeneous block and then wrap it in plastic wrap . Let it solidify in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. After two hours, divide the dough into pieces weighing 0.5 oz each, using a scale .
Shape each piece into an oval and slightly flattened ball , just like a coffee bean. Line a baking tray with parchment paper, transfer the beans onto it, and cut an 'S' with a small knife on their surface . Place the tray in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to let the beans firm up so they maintain their shape once baked. At this point, bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 20 minutes (if using a convection oven, bake at 300°F for 10 minutes). After this time, take them out of the oven and let them cool on a rack . Enjoy your coffee bean cookies accompanied by a good cup of coffee!
You can store the coffee bean cookies in a jar at room temperature for 1 week. If you wish, you can freeze the cookie dough.
To make your coffee bean cookies even more delicious, you can sprinkle them with powdered sugar!
