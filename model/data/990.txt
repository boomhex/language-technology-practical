instructions:
To make tomato piccatine, first cut the veal cutlet into slices to get 4 pieces . Wrap each slice in parchment paper , then pound it with a meat mallet .
This will give you thin slices . In a saucepan, heat the oil, add the crushed garlic clove , and let it flavor for a few minutes, then add the tomato and salt.
Flavor with 4-5 basil leaves and cook for about 10-15 minutes covered with a lid. At the end of cooking, turn off the heat and set aside . In another pan, melt the butter with a drizzle of oil .
Place the slices of meat , salt , and let them brown on both sides for a few minutes, just enough to brown the meat .
Slice the mozzarella and let it drain by placing it in a colander , this way it won't release water during cooking. In a baking dish of about 12x8 inches, spread 1-2 tablespoons of tomato on the bottom .
Place the meat and pour the rest of the tomato over it , so that it covers it .
Now distribute the sliced ham and mozzarella . Chop the previously washed and dried parsley .
Season the dish with the parsley and remaining basil . Place in a preheated oven in grill mode for about 5-10 minutes or until the mozzarella melts . The tomato piccatine is ready, enjoy them hot !
It is advisable to consume the tomato piccatine immediately, if you have leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator for a couple of days at most. You can freeze the preparation if you have used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
In the warmer season, if you don't want to turn on the oven, you can heat the piccatine in a covered pan just long enough to melt the mozzarella.
