When it comes to adding some fun to your holiday meals, especially around Christmas, potato stars are a must-have on Italian tables. They're everywhere—seriously! Different regions have their own twist, but the basics? Pretty simple. Smooth, tender mashed potatoes shaped into cute stars, then baked to a crispy finish. Kids just love them for their playful shape and delicious taste. It's like a party snack crossed with classic duchess potatoes —so so tasty! And the sauce? Maybe just for dipping.
What's really cool is these aren't just for munching—they double as table decorations, bringing a festive and bright vibe to any meal. You'll often find these star-shaped delights right up front at an Italian holiday gathering—way way festive—and they're perfect for jazzing up any main dish. During the festive season, mashed potato stars are super versatile and pair well with any main course, whether it is roasted meat or fish. I mean, who doesn't love a side that's easy to pick up and eat, right?
Plus, they fit right in with other festive potato dishes or potato appetizers . Thing is, it's not just about the look—each bite is moist and creamy inside, offering a great mix of textures. Some families even whip up extra batches because these sweet and savory treats disappear fast. Like, really fast.
Italian parents have this clever trick: shape veggies or sides into fun forms, and suddenly everyone wants seconds. And look, whether you’re gearing up for a big Christmas dinner or just looking to add some joy to a regular Sunday, potato stars have a knack for making meals feel more joyful. And here's the thing—they make meals a lot more fun for everyone at the table. Can't go wrong with a bit of sparkle in your culinary lineup, ensuring that both kids and adults leave with smiles on their faces.
To make the potato stars, first cook the potatoes: choose potatoes of approximately the same size, put them in a pot, and cover them with cold water, then add a pinch of coarse salt and the bay leaves . Bring to a boil and cook for about 35-40 minutes until they are soft. Once cooked, drain the potatoes and let them cool slightly, then peel them and transfer them into a bowl.
Mash the potatoes with a fork to make a puree , salt, pepper. Season with grated nutmeg and corn starch .
Add the eggs and knead everything with your hands , then add the grated caciocavallo cheese and mix again to combine the mixture.
Grease a sheet of parchment paper with a little olive oil and spread the potato mixture with the back of a spoon . Grease a second sheet of parchment paper and place it over the potato mixture.
Level the mixture with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 5/16 inch . At this point, let it firm up in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. After the cooling time, cut the shapes using a star-shaped cookie cutter : we used a cutter measuring 3 inches from point to point. Transfer the obtained stars onto squares of parchment paper that you have previously cut . Knead the scraps again to cut out more stars: with these quantities, you should get about 15.
When you have made all the stars , let them firm up in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Now you're ready to fry: heat the seed oil in a large pan (it should not exceed 356°F) and immerse the stars upside down with the parchment paper square still attached, no more than 1 or 2 at a time . The parchment paper will detach after a few seconds, so remove it with a slotted spoon .
Drain the stars when they are beautifully golden and transfer them onto absorbent paper to dry the excess oil . Your potato stars are ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the stars immediately after frying. The raw stars can be stored in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to one day. Alternatively, they can be frozen separating them with parchment paper.
If the potato mixture is too soft, place it back in the refrigerator to make it firmer and easier to work with.
