BBQ scamorza skewers bring a fun, relaxed vibe to any outdoor meal. Really, they do. Especially when the sun’s shining and everyone’s in the mood for grilling. In southern Italy, these are a favorite way to make everyone, even vegetarians, feel welcome. And what makes them stand out isn’t just the smoked scamorza skewers . It is also the tender vegetables like eggplant, zucchini, and peppers that get a little crispy and golden on the grill. And look, before they hit the heat, each piece is brushed with mayonnaise and coated in this super aromatic breading with lemon zest and rosemary. So here's the thing: this gives every bite a tangy kick and makes the skewers smell like a summer herb garden. Wrapping the cheese in lemon leaves isn’t just clever—it keeps the scamorza from melting through the grate and adds a hint of citrus, making the cheese extra moist and flavorful.
In southern Italy, families use whatever veggies are fresh from the garden or market. No strict rules here—cherry tomatoes, thick zucchini slices, and colorful peppers all work beautifully. BBQ scamorza skewers are as much about fun as they are about food. Friends gather around, chatting and snacking while these cheesy, veggie-packed appetizers get that awesome grilled finish. The combination of Italian cheese skewers and bright, seasonal vegetables turns simple ingredients into something really hard to resist. For real. You’ll notice how the lemon and rosemary breading soaks into the cheese, giving each bite a burst of tangy and herby flavor that makes these grilled scamorza skewers a total hit. This kind of easy, outdoor cooking is what summer in southern Italy is all about—simple, tasty and perfect for sharing with a crowd. For anyone searching for new BBQ cheese recipes or easy summer grilling ideas, these skewers always get people talking. And coming back for seconds. Whether you’re hosting a backyard gathering or just enjoying a meal with family, these skewers are a great way to celebrate the flavors of summer. Which is great.
To prepare the scamorza cheese skewers on the BBQ, first wash all the vegetables, lemons, and leaves. Then dry them well. Now prepare the breadcrumb coating. Coarsely blend the bread and transfer it into a bowl. Add the grated Grana cheese, rosemary needles, and the zest of 2 lemons . Add a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper .
Mix well and set aside. Now take care of the vegetables. Start with the eggplants, cut them first into slices about 0.5 inches thick and then into chunks .
Now move on to the red bell pepper, cut it into slices , remove the seeds inside, and then cut it into chunks . Do the same with the yellow bell pepper .
Proceed to the zucchini, trim it and cut it into thick rings . Leave the cherry tomatoes whole. Now take the scamorzine and brush them with the mayonnaise . Then do the same for all the vegetables , except for the cherry tomatoes, and gather them in a baking dish.
Next, pass the scamorzine in the breadcrumb coating and transfer them to another tray , then do the same for all the other vegetables .
Now compose the skewers. First, skewer a cherry tomato , then wrap one of the scamorzine in a lemon leaf before skewering it. Now add a zucchini , a bell pepper, and a piece of eggplant.
Continue with another scamorzina and add more vegetables. Finish with a whole cherry tomato . Make all the skewers this way, considering that each should have two scamorzine, two cherry tomatoes, and alternate the other vegetables . Now you are ready to cook your skewers. Soak the ends of the wooden sticks to prevent them from burning, then place the skewers on the hot grill of the BBQ, making sure to place the scamorzine on the side with the leaves .
Close the barbecue lid and cook for about 5 minutes. When they are well grilled, turn them over and briefly continue cooking on the other side. Using tongs, remove the skewers from the barbecue and transfer them onto a cutting board . Add a bit more lemon zest and serve them hot with mayonnaise and a squeeze of lemon to taste.
We recommend serving the skewers immediately.
Try using lime instead of lemon for a really unique aroma!
