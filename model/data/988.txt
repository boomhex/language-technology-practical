instructions:
To prepare the zucchini and ricotta balls, first put the ricotta in a strainer and let it drain. Meanwhile, wash the zucchini, remove the ends, and grate them using a large-holed grater: you'll need 300 grams (approximately 10.5 oz) of grated zucchini . Transfer the grated zucchini to a bowl and add the drained ricotta and the grated Grana Padano PDO cheese .
Add the breadcrumbs , the egg , and the chopped basil .
Salt , pepper, and mix everything together using a spoon . Once you have a homogeneous mixture, take a spoonful of dough at a time and shape it between the palms of your hands to form a ball weighing about 30 grams (approximately 1 oz), then flatten it slightly .
As they are ready, place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, then drizzle with a little olive oil . With these quantities, you should obtain about 20 balls. Bake in a preheated static oven at 400°F for about 25 minutes, turning them halfway through cooking . Once cooked, serve your zucchini and ricotta balls right away !
It is recommended to consume the zucchini and ricotta balls as soon as they are made. Alternatively, they can be stored in the refrigerator for one day in an airtight container, or you can freeze them raw and cook them directly from frozen, extending the cooking time.
You can replace basil with mint or thyme to flavor your zucchini and ricotta balls! For a crunchy crust, you can roll them in breadcrumbs before cooking.
