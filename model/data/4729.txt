When all the alcohol has evaporated, add 4 ladles of the porcini water and continue cooking for another 5 minutes. Then add the tomato sauce , a fresh bay leaf , and another 3 ladles of porcini water. Mix well and cook on low heat for about 1 hour.
When the sauce has thickened, add the pepper , chopped parsley , and mix. Taste and, if necessary, adjust the salt. Your mushroom sauce is ready to be enjoyed !
The mushroom sauce can be stored in the refrigerator in a closed container for 3 days. If you wish to store it longer, once cooled, you can freeze it. This way, it can be stored for up to 2 months.
You can use various aromatic herbs such as thyme, marjoram, and sage. If you do not want to use the water in which the porcini mushrooms were soaked, you can opt for chicken or vegetable broth.
