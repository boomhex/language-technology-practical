instructions:
Ravioli del plin is this super special dish from Piedmont, Italy. They really love their pasta-making there—especially around Christmas. And look, "plin" means "pinch" in the local dialect. It totally describes how each of these Piedmontese pasta parcels is sealed by pinching the dough around this rich filling of salsiccia and mascarpone. So so good.
This combo gives it that extra tender and smooth texture, with a creamy twist on the classic meat-only versions you might run into in traditional trattorias. You will not just find it with a simple tomato sauce or butter—nope. Instead, it really shines with a rich, meaty brown butter sauce known as fondo bruno. Made from pan drippings, it just boosts the deep and moist flavors in every bite.
In Piedmont, they love adding fresh sage to sizzling butter. The aroma? Unreal. It fills the kitchen with this comforting vibe that fits the homemade ravioli perfectly.
Regional pride is big with ravioli del plin . Tons of local variations, like agnolotti del plin, or even ones filled with greens and cheese. This mascarpone and salsiccia version? Pretty much made for festive occasions. It feels cozy and celebratory. The mascarpone gives it a silky texture, and the salsiccia throws in a savory kick.
When paired with the golden butter and sage sauce, it's simple but never boring. Piedmontese cooks are really into getting the filling spot on—creamy but not too heavy—and making sure the pasta is thin enough to be delicate, but still holding together. Each bite is a flavor symphony: salty sausage, sweet creamy cheese, crisp sage, and the deep fondo bruno.
Trying this traditional Italian pasta is such a cool way to dive into Italian regional cuisine, especially when families come together to roll, stuff and pinch these little gems. It's in these moments that special food traditions are born, sharing the warmth of Piedmont's culinary heritage. And the sauce? Seriously good.

To make plin ravioli with brown sauce, first prepare the Beef Broth that you will need to cook the filling. For the filling: heat a generous drizzle of oil in a large casserole, preferably cast iron, suitable for oven cooking as well. Pat dry the beef, pork loin, and sausage, from which you removed the casing, then lightly salt them . Place the meat in the casserole with the hot oil, being careful to compact the sausage meat between your hands to flatten it . Let the pieces of meat brown over high heat for 3-4 minutes without touching them; when one side is well colored, turn them with kitchen tongs and continue this way until all sides are well browned .
The sausage will take less time to brown, so once ready, you can remove it from the casserole and transfer it to a bowl; as the other pieces of meat brown, remove them too and keep them aside in the bowl . In the same casserole, add another drizzle of oil to the cooking juices , then add the chopped onion .
Add the chopped carrot and celery , salt and fry, scraping the caramelized bottom well with a wooden spoon . When the sautéed vegetables are softened, place the pieces of meat back in the casserole, along with any juices they have released .
Slightly raise the heat and deglaze with the wine . Let simmer for a couple of minutes (the wine doesn't need to evaporate completely), then pour in the hot meat broth until the meat is covered about halfway . Cover with the lid and transfer to a preheated static oven at 320°F for about 90-120 minutes, checking every half hour if more broth needs to be added . At the end of cooking, the meat should fall apart.
While the meat is cooking, prepare the Homemade pasta (sheets and shapes) : pour the flour and whole eggs into a large bowl (or on a work surface) , then add the egg yolks and begin to mix with a fork .
Continue to work the mixture with your hands first in the bowl and then on the work surface until you obtain a smooth and rather firm dough . Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for the time it takes to prepare the filling.
At the end of the cooking time, check that the meat is soft enough to fall apart with a spoon , then transfer it to a cutting board and finely chop it with a knife . Keep the cooking juices in the casserole and put it back on the heat; bring to a boil and let reduce until you obtain a very thick consistency .
Finely chop the spinach and escarole, which you previously wilted in a pan with a drizzle of oil (squeeze the spinach to remove excess liquid) . Add the vegetables to the chopped meat, which you have transferred to a large bowl .
Also add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano PDO , the mascarpone , the egg, and the yolk .
At this point, the cooking juices will have reduced, so pour them into the filling . Mix well to combine everything, then adjust for salt and pepper . Once the filling is ready , you can transfer it for convenience into a piping bag without a nozzle.
At this point, take the fresh pasta dough and divide it in half with a dough scraper ; wrap one of the two parts in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out. Flatten the first portion on the work surface and dust it with semolina , then pass it through the rollers of the pasta machine starting with the widest setting . Fold the dough and dust it again with semolina, then pass it through the pasta machine again, gradually reducing the thickness.
When you have obtained a sheet of dough 1 mm thick, lay it on the work surface and squeeze small mounds of filling about 1 cm from the edge, spacing them a couple of cm apart . Gently fold the sheet over itself and pinch with your fingers at the sides of the filling to obtain the classic 'plin' shape, taking care to remove the air inside .
Use a pasta cutter to first cut the strip of ravioli and then to separate them individually ; this way, a sort of outer 'pocket' will form to hold the seasoning. Proceed in this way with the second portion of dough and place the obtained ravioli on a tray dusted with semolina .
You are ready to cook: bring a pot of salted water to a boil, in the meantime, put the butter in a large pan and turn on the medium flame . When the butter has completely melted, pour the ravioli into the gently boiling water . As soon as the butter turns amber, add the sage leaves .
Add a ladleful of the ravioli cooking water and stir briefly: this way, you have obtained brown butter. When the ravioli rise to the surface, drain them and transfer them to the pan , then toss everything for a minute. Turn off the heat and finish with the cold butter .
Add some grated Parmigiano Reggiano PDO and mix gently . Plate your plin ravioli with brown sauce and serve immediately with a grind of pepper !
Plin ravioli with brown sauce, both cooked and seasoned, can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days in an airtight container.
You can prepare the filling the day before and store it in the refrigerator (this way, it will be even more flavorful).
To freeze raw ravioli, you can proceed as follows: arrange them first on a tray well-spaced to avoid sticking, and once frozen, transfer them to a food bag. You can cook the frozen plin ravioli in plenty of salted water until they rise to the surface.
The secret to this dish lies in the cooking juices, which must be very reduced: in this way, the filling will be moist but not too wet.
You can also use a meat grinder to mince the meat and vegetables: we chose to chop the meat by knife to have a chunkier filling.
If you prefer, you can increase or decrease the size of the ravioli according to your taste!
