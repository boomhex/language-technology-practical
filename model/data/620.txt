instructions:
To prepare the scallops on artichoke cream and aromatic herbs, start with the cream: peel and cut the potatoes into chunks about 3/4 inch , place them in a saucepan with the artichoke hearts .
Pour in 1 cup of water , salt and pepper to taste , then cook for about 20 minutes over medium-high heat, covered .
When ready, blend everything with an immersion blender until obtaining a smooth cream. Meanwhile, prepare the spicy oil: cut the fresh chilies into 3 parts , place them in a saucepan with 1 1/2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil . Let them infuse over very low heat for about 7 minutes, then turn off the heat and set aside.
Chop the aromatic herbs (marjoram, fennel, and mint) , keeping aside only a few whole marjoram leaves. When the artichoke and potato cream is lukewarm, add the chopped herbs and mix well; adjust salt and pepper if necessary. Finally, take care of the scallops: wash and dry them well, carefully coat them with extra virgin olive oil .
Heat a non-stick pan well, the base should be scorching: sear the scallops on both sides over high heat , in just a few moments, the scallops will brown. Compose the dish: pour two tablespoons of artichoke cream on each plate, place a scallop in the center, drizzle with a few drops of chili oil. Season with a sprinkle of freshly ground mixed peppercorns, two marjoram leaves , and a few flakes of salt on the scallop.
The cream keeps in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 2 days.
We do not recommend freezing.
