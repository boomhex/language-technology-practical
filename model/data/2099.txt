instructions:
To prepare the blueberry and pistachio porridge, pour the milk into a saucepan, then also add the water and a pinch of salt . Pour in the rolled oats and stir with a spatula .
Turn on the heat and continue to stir occasionally, cooking over medium heat for about 4-6 minutes, until you achieve your desired consistency : it should be creamy and very thick. Meanwhile, roughly chop the pistachios and set them aside. After the indicated time, turn off the heat and pour about 1.8 oz (50 g) of agave syrup into the oatmeal and stir; the rest of the syrup will be used for the final garnish.
Then add half of the pistachios and always stir with a spatula . Transfer the porridge into two small bowls and garnish the surface with the remaining chopped pistachios ,
with the reserved agave syrup and fresh blueberries . Your blueberry and pistachio porridge is now ready to enjoy .
Consume the blueberry and pistachio porridge immediately; any form of storage is not recommended.
Instead of agave syrup, you can use honey or maple syrup.
Garnish your porridge with the fruit you love most... for example, Apple and Hazelnut Porridge !
