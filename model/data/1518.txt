instructions:
To prepare Sicilian taralli, first, place the all-purpose flour in a bowl and add the sugar . Add the cubed butter and the milk at room temperature .
Then add the baking powder along with the ammonia and the eggs . Grate the zest of a lemon inside .
Knead everything by hand . When you have obtained a homogeneous mixture, transfer it to a floured surface and continue kneading until you have a dough similar to shortcrust but softer .
Break off a piece weighing about 2.6 ounces and roll it into a stick with your hands . Then fold it in half .
and twist it (13-14). Then join the two ends together .
to create a ring . Do this for all the others and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, keeping them spaced apart . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 15 minutes, until they are nicely golden .
While the cookies are baking, prepare the glaze. Put the sugar, lemon juice , and water in a bowl. Stir with a spoon until you get a homogeneous glaze .
Brush the hot taralli with the glaze and let them dry at room temperature before serving .
Sicilian taralli keep at room temperature, even better if stored in a tin box, for 3-4 days.
You can use the same amount of lard instead of butter.
If you prefer, you can flavor the cookies with anise liqueur or anise seeds!
