These beef and artichoke pies are super super great when you want to spice up your meal. Who can resist a dish that’s both golden outside and bursting with flavor inside? No one, right?
Across Italy, especially in regions like Lombardy and Piedmont, savory mini meat pies are a staple, featuring rich fillings. These beef and potato pies blend hearty meat with fresh veggies, a trick Italian cooks have used forever. And listen, the beef stays moist by soaking up the wine, and each bite offers a bit of crispy potato and artichoke.
Serving them as individual beef pies makes everyone feel special. For sure. They work well as a main course for a nice dinner or as a fancy appetizer if you want something light but still tangy and filling. Whether for a family gathering or a dinner with friends, these mini pies bring a little surprise to the table. Try them when you want to wow everyone with an Italian vibe and a twist that keeps guests coming back for more. Pretty simple.
To prepare the mini beef pies with potatoes and artichokes, start by bringing a pot with a little water to a boil and cleaning the artichokes. Before handling them, protect your hands with latex gloves or rub a halved lemon on your skin to avoid them turning black. Remove the outer, tougher leaves of the artichokes , cut off the hard tops with a small knife and remove the stem , then transfer them for a few seconds into a bowl filled with water and lemon to prevent them from browning .
Drain and dry the artichokes thoroughly, then cut them in half to remove the internal fuzz and into slices about 3/16 inches thick , then sauté them in a pan drizzled with olive oil . Season with salt and pepper and let cook for just a few minutes, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, peel and slice the potatoes, cut each slice into cubes and immerse them for 5-6 minutes in boiling salted water to blanch them slightly while keeping them slightly firm. After this time, drain them and add them to the artichokes . Sauté the vegetables for 3-4 minutes, then turn off the heat and set them aside to cool.
Finally, take care of the meat. Cut the beef into cubes about 3/8 inch thick , then sear them in a pan drizzled with olive oil , season with salt, and deglaze the meat with red wine . Let cook for 1 minute, then turn off the heat and set the meat aside to cool.
Take 8 dough discs and place each one in muffin molds, crimping the edges like a basket. Fill each dough disc with a spoonful of vegetables and a few beef cubes . Place the remaining dough discs on a work surface and cut them with an 8 cm diameter cutter, depending on the size of the muffin molds .
Close the pies with the cut dough discs , fold the edges inside and seal them well by pressing with the tines of a fork. Brush the surface with a beaten egg and bake them in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 20 minutes (if using a fan oven, at 320°F for 10 minutes). Once cooked, remove the mini beef pies with potatoes and artichokes from the oven and let them rest a few minutes before unmolding and serving.
You can store the mini pies for up to 3 days in the refrigerator, placed in an airtight container.
To prevent the meat from becoming stringy, cook it very briefly, sautéing it well in the pan. Want a spicy note? Mince a fresh chili pepper and sauté it with the beef!
