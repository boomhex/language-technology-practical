To make the honey-decorated cupcakes, start by preparing the basic batter: place the softened butter pieces and sugar in a bowl and work the mixture into a cream ; add the egg and continue to mix the ingredients until you get a light and fluffy mixture.
In a separate bowl, pour the flour, cornflour, then also add the baking powder and a pinch of salt ; sift the powders into the bowl containing the butter, sugar, and egg mixture and mix with a wooden spoon to combine the ingredients, then add the room temperature milk ,
stir and finally add the unsweetened cocoa powder . In a saucepan for a bain-marie, melt the chopped dark chocolate , add it to the mixture and mix to obtain a homogeneous batter .
Transfer the batter into a piping bag with a smooth nozzle and squeeze it into the paper cups positioned inside a muffin mold . Bake the cupcakes in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 15 minutes (or convection oven at 320°F for 10 minutes). Once cooked, remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool . In the meantime, take care of the cream: cut the vanilla bean in half and extract the seeds,
place the gelatin sheets in a bowl with cold water for about 10 minutes to soften them . Pour the milk into a saucepan and bring it to a boil, flavor with the vanilla bean seeds , add the sugar and stir to dissolve it,
then also add the honey , stir again to combine the ingredients, and after that, add the well-wrung gelatin sheets , stirring to dissolve them and thicken the cream, and then turn off the heat, transfer it to a bowl, cover it with cling film in contact and let it cool. First, place it at room temperature and then in the fridge for at least a couple of hours so that it is well cold before adding the whipped cream. Before using it, it is advisable to smooth it by working it for a few moments with the whisk.
After two hours, take the fresh cream and whip it with electric whisks: it should be semi-whipped , incorporate the semi-whipped cream into the cold and smoothed cream with the whisks and then take the yellow food coloring and add a few drops into the cream , just enough to get a bright yellow color.
Cover the yellow cream with cling film in contact and put it in the refrigerator to firm up for about two hours. When the cream is well firm and compact, transfer it into a piping bag with a star nozzle and cover the cupcakes with a generous dollop of cream . Finally, garnish the cupcakes with sugar decorations of your choice or even colored sugar balls. The honey-decorated cupcakes are ready to enjoy!
Store the honey-decorated cupcakes in the refrigerator for a maximum of a couple of days. You can freeze the cupcakes without filling. You can keep the buttercream separately, covered with cling film, in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
You can replace the milk cream with a delicious Ganache cream .
