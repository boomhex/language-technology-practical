instructions:
To prepare the carrot roll, first peel and finely grate the carrots . You will need to obtain 5 oz. In another bowl, pour the eggs and brown sugar. Mix with an electric whisk for about 5 minutes. When you have obtained a fluffy and frothy mixture, add the cinnamon ,
all-purpose flour , almond flour , and baking powder .
Mix the batter with the electric whisk on low speed for about 1 minute . When you have achieved a homogeneous consistency, add the grated carrots and gently mix with a spatula using circular motions from bottom to top .
Transfer the batter to a 12x16 inch baking sheet lined with parchment paper , spread the batter to fill the entire surface , and bake in a preheated static oven at 390°F for 15 minutes. Once cooked, remove it from the oven
and flip the soft sponge onto a sheet of parchment paper . Gently remove the parchment paper used for baking and cover the sponge with plastic wrap . Set aside and allow it to cool completely for about 1 hour. In the meantime, prepare the filling. In a saucepan, pour 0.7 oz of cream and bring to a boil .
Turn off the heat and add the drained gelatin , stirring until completely dissolved. Set aside for a moment. Pour the remaining 14 oz of cream into a bowl, add the vanilla extract , and start working with the electric whisk, incorporating the powdered sugar little by little .
You should obtain semi-whipped cream . At this point, still with the whisk running, add the dissolved gelatin in the now lukewarm cream and mix until well incorporated .
Take the soft sponge and flip it over again. Pour the filling over it and spread it over the entire surface . Transfer to a tray and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Then take it out and, using the parchment paper, roll it from the longer side, applying gentle pressure with your hands .
When it is well rolled, cover with parchment paper and wrap it with plastic wrap. Transfer to the freezer and let it cool for 2 hours. Take the roll out and remove the plastic wrap and parchment paper. Trim the ends of the roll with a knife . Pour another 5 oz of cream into a bowl, add the powdered sugar
and whip it. It should be smooth and shiny . Using a spatula, cover the entire surface of the roll and refrigerate for another 30 minutes. Meanwhile, move on to the decorations. Wash, dry, and slice the small carrot into rounds and set aside.
Prepare the caramel: pour the sugar and water into a saucepan . Wait a few minutes, and when the sugar is well caramelized, add the carrots . Rotate the saucepan to fully cover the carrots . Transfer to parchment paper and let cool at room temperature.
Now prepare the sugared walnuts. In a saucepan, pour the sugar and water. When the sugar has completely dissolved, add the walnuts and mix. The sugar not yet caramelized will stick to the walnut kernels, giving the typical sugared effect . Transfer to parchment paper and let cool at room temperature .
Then take the roll, decorate with walnuts and carrots , add the currants, a pinch of cinnamon , and serve .
The carrot roll can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
Alternatively, it can be frozen without the decorations for 2 weeks.
Almond flour can be replaced with hazelnut or walnut flour for a stronger flavor.
