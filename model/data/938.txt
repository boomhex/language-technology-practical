Chickpea farinata is, well, a delicious surprise, especially when you give the Ligurian style from northern Italy a go. Chickpea farinata shines with its simple mix of chickpea flour, water, and olive oil. Really good stuff. And the key? Letting the batter rest so the flour hydrates properly. This gives you a base that’s crispy on the edges but still moist inside. And here's the thing: in Liguria, they love throwing in seasonal ingredients, and this artichoke farinata is a tasty twist. Thinly sliced artichokes and herbs mix into the batter, soaking up all those flavors while baking at high heat. Seriously good. The aroma as it cooks? You’ll want to chase it around the kitchen—nutty, herby, and totally inviting. Really, it’s something else. In Liguria, farinata is a classic snack, and the artichoke version really really elevates it. Some see it as a special treat since it shows up only when artichokes are in season. And look, unlike the usual chickpea flatbread , this version sometimes gets topped with shredded mozzarella at the end. Cheese stays gooey and melts into the hot surface, adding a creamy bite to the golden and crispy top. So so good. This farinata recipe is perfect for sharing. Whether you slice it like pizza or tear off warm pieces, it’s super easy to make for friends, and nobody misses regular bread since this is gluten-free yet totally filling. Many in Liguria enjoy it straight from the pan, maybe with a squeeze of lemon or a sprinkle of extra herbs. For sure. However you serve this chickpea flatbread , the combo of tender chickpea, crisp artichoke, and creamy cheese gives you a snack or meal that feels unique every time. Plus, it’s packed with those Italian flavors that pair well with so many dishes. Whether you’re entertaining or just treating yourself, this farinata offers a bit of rustic charm and delicious flavor in every bite. So here's the deal: it’s a taste of Liguria on your table, ensuring everyone enjoys a slice of this Italian classic.

To prepare the chickpea farinata with artichokes, put the chickpea flour in a bowl and pour in some of the water at room temperature . Mix everything well, taking care not to form lumps, and continue to pour the water until you obtain a liquid and homogeneous mixture .
Cover with plastic wrap and let the mixture rest out of the fridge for a minimum of 5 hours to a maximum of 10 hours, stirring it from time to time. After the necessary time, you will notice foam on the surface: remove it with a skimmer , until you eliminate it all .
Add 1.5 tbsp of oil and salt to the mixture. Mix well with a whisk. Drain the artichokes well and cut them into wedges or simply in half if they are not very large .
Grease 3 trays with a diameter of 12.5 inches with plenty of extra virgin olive oil (traditionally, copper or aluminum trays would be used, but you can also use a simple non-stick tray) , and with a ladle distribute the chickpea mixture over them . Consider that you will need 1/3 for each. Add the previously cut oil-packed artichokes .
Add some thyme leaves too , then bake in a preheated static oven at 482°F and cook in the lower part of the oven, in contact with the bottom, for the first 10 minutes. After this time, move the tray to the upper part of the oven and let it cook for another 10 minutes until the farinata is well browned. Remove the farinata from the oven and finish the preparation by decorating the surface with hand-shredded mozzarella and thyme and marjoram leaves .
We recommend consuming the chickpea and artichoke farinata immediately. Alternatively, it can be stored in the fridge for 1 or 2 days, but we recommend adding the mozzarella only when serving, after you have reheated it.
Instead of thyme and marjoram leaves, you can flavor the farinata with rosemary or sage.
