Malloreddus, also known as Sardinian gnocchetti, are a traditional pasta shape from Sardinia, highly appreciated for their texture and versatility. Made with durum wheat semolina, these small gnocchetti have a ridged shell shape that allows them to hold sauces perfectly. The ribbed surface is ideal for capturing rich and flavorful sauces like alla Campidanese! Making malloreddus is an art that requires patience and skill: the dough, made only from durum wheat semolina and water, is worked by hand until it reaches a smooth and even consistency. Each small piece of pasta is carefully and skillfully shaped to create the typical ridged form: this artisanal process, handed down from generation to generation, is essential for keeping Sardinian culinary tradition alive. Malloreddus can be dressed in various ways, from the classic tomato sauce with sausage to more modern variants like those with clams, bottarga, or seasonal vegetables. Their rustic flavor and firm texture make them ideal for hearty first courses that are a must on festive tables.
Here are more recipes with homemade malloreddus:

To prepare malloreddus, combine the re-milled semolina in a bowl with about two-thirds of the water needed. The remaining water should only be used if the dough is too dry . Add a pinch of salt . First mix with a fork so the flour absorbs the water, then transfer the dough to a work surface .
Knead by hand until you obtain a smooth dough ball . Let the dough rest for 15-20 minutes, covered with a bowl, at room temperature. After the resting time , divide the dough into small pieces with a bench scraper .
Form strips of dough about 0.2 inches in diameter . It’s important not to add more flour when forming the gnocchetti, or the dough will become difficult to handle. Use a bench scraper to cut the strips into pieces about 0.3 inches .
Then roll them on a gnocchi board, keeping the cut side up . Continue in this way until all the dough is used up . Place the malloreddus on a lightly floured cloth or floured surface .
The fresh gnocchetti should be cooked immediately after preparation.
Alternatively, you can freeze them arranged on a tray to prevent them from sticking together. Once frozen, they can be stored in a bag or airtight container. They can be cooked directly from frozen.
Some recipes include adding saffron to the dough, which gives a touch of flavor and color to the fresh pasta.
To give the typical shape, it's important to ridge the gnocchi from the cut side; otherwise, they will take on a square rather than round shape.
