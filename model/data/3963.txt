To make the tagliatelle nests with Passito di Pantelleria, start with the fresh pasta dough (for more details, consult our fresh pasta cooking school sheet): place the sifted flour , vanilla bean seeds , eggs , and salt in a large bowl
and the granulated sugar , Passito di Pantelleria , softened butter in pieces
and knead vigorously by hand until you get a smooth, homogeneous, and elastic dough (alternatively, you can use a stand mixer to knead). Divide the obtained dough into 3 pieces; take one, ensuring to cover the others with plastic wrap to prevent the dough from drying out,
flour it, flatten it slightly , and then pass the dough through the pasta machine to the narrowest roller to get a thin sheet (alternatively, you can roll it out by hand with a rolling pin until you get a thin sheet (11-12), then use a smooth wheel to cut it into strips 1/2 inch wide, forming tagliatelle). Once
the sheets are made, cut them with the appropriate roller for tagliatelle . Take two tagliatelle, gently roll them around your fingers to form a sort of nest and place them on a suitable rack or on a floured cloth. Continue this way until the fresh pasta is finished, you should obtain about 40 nests.
Now attend to cooking: heat some seed oil on the fire, take a nest and immerse it in the hot oil (the ideal frying temperature is 340°F-355°F) and when it is golden, drain it and place it on a tray lined with kitchen paper . When the sweet tagliatelle nests with Passito di Pantelleria are cold, sprinkle them with powdered sugar and enjoy!
It is advisable to consume the tagliatelle nests immediately, they can be frozen raw and then thawed in the refrigerator before cooking.
If you want to vary the aroma of your tagliatelle nests, instead of Passito di Pantelleria, a highly aromatic fortified wine, you can use other spirits such as Port, Grappa, Sambuca, or Anise.
