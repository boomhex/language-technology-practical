Fruit skewers with chocolate sauce and hazelnut crumble are a fun, tasty, and delicious way to serve fruit at the end of a meal, and you will certainly pleasantly surprise your guests. The preparation of fruit skewers with chocolate sauce and hazelnut crumble is really simple: just organize a few minutes before serving them and… no one will be able to resist, including children, such goodness and spectacle!
To prepare the fruit skewers, get 8 wooden skewers. Then prepare the fruit for skewering: scoop balls from the melon using a melon baller (or if you don't have one, cut the flesh into rather large cubes). Wash the strawberries and remove the green stem , peel the kiwi and cut it into 8 pieces, peel the banana and cut it into fairly thick slices .
Then prepare the chocolate sauce: chop the chocolate into pieces and place it in a bowl over a double boiler, add the cream and melt the chocolate: the result will be a thick and creamy sauce . You can use the sauce warm or cold. Now you can assemble the skewers by alternating pieces of different fruit, finish each skewer with a mint leaf ! On each serving plate, place 2 skewers, drizzle them with chocolate sauce, and then sprinkle with a tablespoon of hazelnut crumble. Serve the fruit skewers with chocolate sauce and hazelnut crumble immediately!
We recommend consuming the fruit skewers as soon as they are ready.
Of course, you can prepare the skewers with any type of fruit, perhaps based on the season of the year in which you serve them.
