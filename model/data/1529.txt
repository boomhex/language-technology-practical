instructions:
To create the peach and yogurt jellies, first blanch 800 g (about 1.8 lbs) of peaches in boiling water for 3 minutes (the other peach will be used for garnish). Then drain them , let them cool slightly, then peel and cut them into pieces .
Pour the peaches into a saucepan and add the sugar , the water , and the lemon zest . Cook over heat for about 20 minutes.
After this time, remove the lemon zest with kitchen tongs and mash the peaches into a puree . Meanwhile, soak the gelatin sheets in cold water for 10 minutes .
Once the gelatin sheets are soft, squeeze them and add them to the hot puree . Stir to dissolve the gelatin well . Pour the mixture into 4 molds of 2.75 inches in diameter and set to chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.
After this time, unmold the jellies by turning them onto a small plate (13-14). Cut the remaining peaches into regular slices and set aside.
Now garnish the jellies with a spoonful of yogurt , distribute the peach slices around , and finally, sprinkle the surface with powdered sugar. Your peach and yogurt jellies are ready to be enjoyed .
Peach and yogurt jellies can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days, taking care to garnish and decorate them just before serving.
As an alternative to peaches, you can use apricots, and for an aromatic touch, you can garnish the jellies with fresh mint leaves.
