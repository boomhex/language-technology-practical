instructions:
To prepare the lamb with cheese and eggs, first clean and finely slice the onion , then dice the lamb . Heat the olive oil in a pan, then add the onions
and the juniper berries , stew the onion over low heat for 5 minutes. Then increase the heat and add the lamb and the herbs: rosemary, bay leaf, and thyme .
Sear the meat for about 5 minutes, season with salt and pepper , then deglaze with the white wine and let it evaporate. Once the alcohol has evaporated, pour in enough water to cover the surface of the meat
Now cover with the lid and continue cooking over medium heat for about 35 minutes. Once the time has passed, you will notice that the lamb remains quite moist, remove the herbs with tongs . In a bowl, beat the eggs with the grated pecorino ,
then lower the heat under the lamb and pour in the egg and pecorino mixture . Stir for a few minutes over very low heat and then turn off the heat when the eggs have slightly set . Serve your lamb hot and if desired, add a drizzle of raw extra virgin olive oil.
It is recommended to consume the preparation immediately; otherwise, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to a couple of days. You can freeze the cooked lamb without the egg and cheese cream.
Lamb with cheese and eggs comes in various tasty variations, in some recipes lemon juice is added to the egg mixture, in others, the meat is floured before cooking. Alternatively, some use garlic cloves instead of onions to flavor the oil.
