instructions:
Tartellette alle pesche e crema, I gotta say, is one of those Italian treats that's just so so elegant—but, you know, without being too fussy. The golden base? It's a classic shortcrust pastry, or pasta frolla, and look, real vanilla seeds are mixed in to give every bite a gentle, sweet aroma. Pretty simple. Italian bakers take their time here—no rushing. Honestly, just letting the dough chill makes it perfectly crisp and light.
And the filling? A velvety vanilla cream that's all about slow, gentle cooking. Egg yolks and sugar get warmed together, then milk and fresh cream added little by little, with a whole vanilla pod thrown in for that really rich, aromatic flavor. It's like the kind of thing you'd see in a pastry shop window in Florence or Turin. And, you know, it shows off just how much care goes into even the smallest peach tartlet .
For the topping, it's really all about those peaches—sliced thin and shaped into little wheat ears, which makes these tartlets look extra special. That little detail? Pure Italian pastry style. Making food not just tasty, but beautiful. After baking, some folks dust them with powdered sugar, others, a jam glaze for that shiny, moist finish. Either way, you end up with a peach cream tart that's tender in the middle and just a bit crispy at the edge. And those summery, sweet peach flavors? For real, amazing.
These tartlets are a favorite peach dessert in Italian homes, especially when peaches are at their peak. Perfect for a weekend treat, brunch, or even as a fancy dinner ending. So here's the thing—whether you're into traditional peach pastry or want an easy peach tart recipe that feels a bit extra, this one really brings out the best of Italian baking. Simple ingredients, a little patience, and a whole lot of style. Enjoy these tartlets as a nod to the flavors and craftsmanship that make Italian desserts so beloved. Pretty much irresistible.
To prepare the peach and cream tartlets, start with the shortcrust pastry (you can find the detailed procedure Shortcrust pastry ): in a mixer, place the flour, add the cold butter in pieces , the powdered sugar , and the salt .
Then activate the mixer until you obtain a sandy mixture . Transfer it onto a pastry board or a cool working surface. Then take half of a vanilla pod, extract the seeds with the tip of a knife , and add them to the sandy mixture .
Form the classic fountain shape and pour the egg yolk in the center ; briefly knead everything by hand until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough shaped into a loaf.
Wrap it with plastic wrap and let it cool in the refrigerator for at least half an hour. Meanwhile, prepare the cream: in a large pot, pour the egg yolks and add the sugar , mix over very low heat with a whisk until the sugar dissolves .
Then add the cornstarch and flour by sifting them in gradually and continue mixing with the whisk to obtain a homogeneous and lump-free mixture . At this point, add the milk at room temperature and the cream slowly, always stirring with a whisk.
Take the other half of the vanilla pod, cut it with the knife and extract the seeds to add to the cream , then immerse the half-open pod split in two . Finally, grate the untreated lemon zest directly into the pot .
Continuously stir with the whisk and let the cream cook over very low heat for at least 15 minutes or until the cream reaches a creamy and compact consistency like custard . Then turn off the heat, let the cream cool slightly, and transfer it into a piping bag. At this point, take the shortcrust pastry from the refrigerator and place it on a floured working surface or pastry board. Roll it out with a rolling pin until it reaches a thickness of half an inch (if the shortcrust pastry tends to break, place it between two sheets of lightly oiled parchment paper and roll it out with the rolling pin). Then use a pastry cutter to cut out 8 discs about 3.5-4 inches in diameter .
Place the obtained discs into molds with a diameter of 3 inches previously buttered and floured. Line each mold well with the pastry, adhering to the bottom and sides. Take the piping bag with the cream and fill each mold to the edge ; then place them in the fridge to cool: this way, you will prevent the shortcrust edges from collapsing inward during baking. Meanwhile, prepare the peach decoration: cut them into 4 wedges and then in half widthwise .
Starting from the wide base, make a small oblique incision in the center as if to form an upside-down V (25-26). Leaving a few millimeters of space, make more V-shaped cuts; repeat the operation until almost reaching the end of the peach quarter .
At this point, gently slide the peach pieces down with your fingers ; you should have formed a spike. Place it in the center of each tartlet and bake them in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 45-50 minutes (if using a convection oven, bake at 320°F for 40-45 minutes). Take them out of the oven when the edges of the tartlets are golden . Unmold and serve your warm peach and cream tartlets!
The peach and cream tartlets can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
The beauty is almost an ingredient in this dish! If you want to go all out, brush the tartlets (once baked) with peach jam, or your preferred jam, after filtering it with a fine sieve: beautiful and, of course, delicious!
