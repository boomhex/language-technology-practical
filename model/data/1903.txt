To prepare spirulina pasta, start by making the fresh pasta: sift the flour into a bowl , then add the spirulina and the eggs .
Knead until the ingredients are well combined . Flour the work surface and continue working the dough here . Form a ball and wrap it with plastic wrap . Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
After the 30 minute rest period, transfer the dough to a well-floured surface and roll it out with a rolling pin until it is 1/32 inch thick (do not skimp on the amount of flour if needed, as spirulina tends to moisten the dough significantly). Add more flour to the surface of the rolled-out dough ,
roll it up to create a log and then, using a dough scraper or a smooth-bladed knife, make tagliatelle about 1/5 inch thick . Unroll your tagliatelle and place them on a tray .
Now, prepare the dressing: slice the spring onion , the previously peeled carrots , and the zucchinis .
In a pan, gently sauté the spring onion for a few minutes with a drizzle of oil , add the whole cherry tomatoes , and increasing the heat, pour in a little water (about a coffee cup) .
Lower the heat and start crushing the cherry tomatoes. At medium heat, add the zucchinis, carrots , and olives . Salt and pepper the dressing and add another coffee cup of water. Lower the heat again and cook the dressing for about 20 minutes, being careful to add a little more water if it dries out too much . Meanwhile, place a pot full of salted water on the stove, which will be used to cook the pasta.
After the dressing's cooking time, turn off the heat and add the smoked salmon, broken into pieces by hand (the salmon is added off the heat, as it will only need to exploit the warmth of the dressing), then scent with basil and mint leaves . Cook the pasta for about 4-5 minutes at most
and drain it directly into the pan to combine it with the dressing . Toss it over low heat, adding half a ladle of cooking water . Serve your pasta with black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil .
Store the spirulina pasta in the refrigerator and consume it within the day. Freezing after cooking is not recommended. To freeze raw spirulina pasta without dressing, proceed as follows: form nests and place them well spaced on a tray, allow them to set in the fridge for a couple of hours, and then, once they have hardened, distribute them in freezer bags. You can then cook the nests from frozen.
Want to experiment with this recipe using meat? Replace the salmon with grilled duck breast strips, which you will shred and add to the dressing. For a completely vegetarian version, it is recommended to add crumbled feta and mixed sprouts to garnish the dish.
