And look, locals have been making this forever, passing it down from one generation to the next, keeping all those sweet, homey flavors alive. First bite? It’s soft, moist, and has that unmistakable almond taste from those unique Toritto nuts. Really, it’s fantastic. Unlike some fancy layered desserts, the Rosata di Altamura keeps it simple, letting the quality of the ingredients do the talking—super tasty, no fuss.
Gatherings in Altamura almost always have this traditional Italian dessert . It is usually made by someone who learned it from grandma. For sure. It’s one of those cakes that sits right in the middle of the table, ready to be shared over stories and a bit of coffee. Some folks sprinkle sugar on top for a little crispy finish, while others keep it plain to let the almond flavor shine. The Altamura Rosata is part of a whole group of almond-based cakes in Puglia, but the town’s famous bread and those special almonds really really set it apart. It’s a fantastic example of how local food traditions can stick around, keeping the old-school taste of real regional Italian sweets alive. People who love Altamura dessert recipes say there’s nothing quite like it—the combination of humble ingredients and a golden, slightly chewy bite makes it feel like you’re biting into a piece of history. Seriously good. With each slice, you savor not just a dessert but a connection to a rich cultural heritage, still made the way it’s always been. This cake is a true proof of the enduring culinary traditions of Puglia. Honestly, can't go wrong.
To make the Altamura Rosata, first place the almonds in the mixer bowl along with 50 g (1.76 oz) of sugar taken from the total amount . Operate the mixer blades to obtain a sandy, homogeneous mixture . Now separate the egg yolks from the whites and place the latter in a large bowl, whisk them with an electric mixer adding a few drops of lemon .
The egg whites should be light and frothy . Whisk the yolks as well together with the remaining sugar .
Flavor with the liqueur and then gradually incorporate the all-purpose flour and the almonds ground in the mixer .
When the dough is well blended, add the chocolate chips and the beaten egg whites , then gently mix with upward movements so as not to deflate the mixture. Pour the dough into a 9.5 inch (24 cm) diameter cake pan that you have previously buttered .
Bake the cake in a static oven preheated to 320°F (160°C) for 50 minutes. Once baked, remove the Altamura Rosata , let it cool slightly, then remove it from the pan and garnish the surface with powdered sugar as desired .
The Altamura Rosata can be stored at room temperature, under a glass dome, for 2-3 days. You can freeze it after baking.
Like all traditional recipes, the almond Rosata has several variations; some flavor the dough with cinnamon or vanilla, while others do not use liqueur. What cannot be missing are the almonds, which must be of high quality!
