instructions:
To prepare the coconut and lime cookies, pour the all-purpose flour, shredded coconut , diced butter , and brown sugar into a bowl.
Add the salt and start mixing the dough with your hands for a few seconds to get a sandy mixture. Add flavor with the grated lime zest .
Incorporate the egg and knead again with your hands until you get a homogeneous mixture . Add the dark chocolate chips .
Work for a few more seconds to distribute them evenly . Take 25-27 grams (about 1 oz) of dough and form balls , roll them in the shredded coconut, and place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper .
Press lightly with your fingers to flatten the cookies , aiming for a thickness of about 0.4 inches . Bake in a preheated convection oven at 340°F for 5 minutes, then continue for another 10 minutes at 340°F in a static oven, on the middle rack. Once baked, remove the coconut and lime cookies and let them cool slightly before enjoying them !
You can store the coconut and lime cookies in a tin box for up to 3-4 days. You can freeze the raw dough.
You can replace the dark chocolate chips with milk chocolate chips if you prefer a sweeter taste; conversely, if you love the savory notes typical of traditional cookies, just add a pinch more salt!
