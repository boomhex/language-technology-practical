instructions:
To make the anchovy meatballs, first clean the anchovies: remove the head, cut along the back and extract the central bone , then cut off the tail as well. Chop the anchovies with a knife . In the bowl of a food processor with blades, pour the dried tomatoes .
Season with parsley , fresh wild fennel , and mint .
Add the breadcrumbs and blend everything to obtain a homogeneous mixture , then combine it with the anchovies .
Now add the grated cheese , lemon zest , and grated caciocavallo to the mixture.
Finally, add the eggs , season with salt and pepper , and mix .
Take a portion of the mixture about the size of a walnut, approximately 1 oz, and form a meatball , rolling the ball between slightly damp hands (to prevent the mixture from sticking to your hands). As you form the meatballs, place them on a tray lined with parchment paper . Heat oil in a pan, and when it reaches 356°F, cook the meatballs until they are nicely golden; it will only take a few minutes.
Drain the meatballs with a slotted spoon and place them on a tray lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil . Serve the anchovy meatballs hot, seasoning them with salt to taste on the surface .
We recommend consuming the anchovy meatballs immediately.
Frying is the ideal cooking method for these meatballs, but they can also be baked in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 20 minutes.
