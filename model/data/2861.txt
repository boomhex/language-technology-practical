To make the bread snails filled with ham and fontina, start by preparing the bread dough: sift the flour into a bowl , dissolve the dry yeast in warm water in another bowl , stirring with a spoon, then incorporate the malt (you can use sugar as an alternative) until you get a homogeneous mixture.
Pour the mixture into the bowl with the flour , add the olive oil and salt .
Mix the ingredients with your hands and transfer the dough to a countertop and knead until you get a smooth dough ball. Transfer the dough ball to a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap , and let it rise in an oven with the light on for 2 hours. After the rising time, the dough ball will have doubled in volume .
Transfer it to the countertop and roll out a sheet of 10x14 inches, brush the surface with a mixture of beaten egg and a tablespoon of milk . Now move on to the filling: place the fontina slices on the surface of the bread sheet, leaving a 3/4 inch edge to facilitate rolling. Distribute the diced ham . Now roll the dough from the long side .
Once rolled , transfer it to a tray covered with parchment paper and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least half an hour. After this time, cut the roll into slices 1 inch thick , you will get about 12 snails. Transfer them to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and let the snails rise for at least 1 hour in an oven with the light on.
Brush the surface of the snails with the milk and beaten egg emulsion , sprinkle with poppy seeds , and bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 25 minutes (or in a convection oven at 320°F for 15-20 minutes) until the bites are golden. Your bread snails filled with ham and fontina are ready to be served!
You can freeze the bread snails filled with diced ham and fontina both raw and cooked. After cooking, they can be stored in a transparent or paper bag for up to 1-2 days.
You can vary the filling by stuffing the roll with other tasty ingredients: olives, sun-dried tomatoes, anchovies, or even vegetables or other cured meats like bacon or salami, the choice is yours!
