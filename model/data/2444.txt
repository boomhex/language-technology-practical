To prepare the chocolate panna cotta, start with the gelatin sheets: soak the gelatin sheets in a bowl with cold water for at least 10 minutes ; meanwhile, you can chop the dark chocolate on a cutting board with a knife ; once chopped, let it melt in a bain-marie .
In a saucepan, pour the cream and let it heat; sift the powdered sugar separately and then add it, stirring with a whisk to incorporate it well (you can also sift it directly into the pot).
Keep an eye on the chocolate as it melts, and as soon as it is well melted without lumps, add the hazelnut paste and mix thoroughly . Once the chocolate and hazelnut paste are well combined, pour over the hot cream .
Drain the gelatin sheets, now softened, and add them to the still-hot mixture , stirring well to prevent lumps. Prepare the small panna cotta molds, each with a capacity of about 3.4 oz, and pour the mixture ; once cooled to room temperature, place the molds on a tray , or a plate, and leave them in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.
To prepare the salted butter caramel, simply pour the sugar into a small pot along with water and salt . Do not use any utensils to stir; instead, swirl the pot and let the ingredients dissolve well .
When the caramel has turned golden, immerse the pot in cold water to stop the cooking process, place the pot on a surface, and then add the butter, stirring until fully absorbed . After the cooling time, remove the panna cottas from the molds: to make this easier, you can dip the molds in boiling water for a few moments ; then run a small knife around the edge and invert to release. Decorate the chocolate panna cotta with chopped hazelnuts and drizzle a little salted caramel on the plate and the dessert using a spoon . The chocolate and hazelnut panna cotta with salted caramel is now ready to be served.
The chocolate and hazelnut panna cotta with salted caramel can be stored in the refrigerator, still in the mold, covered with plastic wrap, for 4-5 days and should be decorated at the moment. The dessert should not be frozen.
You can decide the color of the caramel based on the cooking time. The longer you cook it, the darker and more bitter it becomes; the less you cook it, the lighter and more delicate it remains. If you don't have a dispenser, feel free to use a ladle; you can also use a funnel to avoid spilling on the counter and the edges of the molds.
