When you think of a soft fruit cake , picture the warmth of a cozy morning in Italy. This classic ciambella alla frutta totally captures that vibe. And look, what really makes it special is sweetened condensed milk. It makes the cake unbelievably soft—seriously—and gives it this moist and fluffy texture. Plus, it sweetens things up, really bringing out the flavor of apples, pears, or mixed berries. Across Italy, some folks might even toss in orange zest or a handful of raisins. For real, it adds a tangy kick.
Regardless of your fruit choice, this light fruit cake never feels too heavy. It is a staple at breakfast with coffee, but it’s also the kind of homemade fruit cake perfect for any snack time. I mean, the beauty is in its simplicity. Unlike a dense Christmas fruit cake , this moist fruit cake recipe keeps things airy. And comforting, too. You might find something similar in a quaint bakery in Tuscany or Emilia-Romagna.
The tender crumb and golden crust make it so inviting. It’s easy to slice and share, bringing homemade warmth to the table. Families in Italy often enjoy this cake on a chill Sunday morning—each member savoring a big, sweet piece. Which is great. As an easy fruit cake recipe , it requires little fuss. Pretty much. Just a few basic ingredients and some ripe fruit. Whether you like it plain or with a dusting of powdered sugar, this Italian delight shows that a light fruit cake can be both moist and satisfying. Definitely without overdoing it.
It’s the kind of cake that turns everyday moments into something special, always bringing smiles when shared. Cannot go wrong.
Prepare the fruit cake by starting to pour the flour into the bowl of a stand mixer , then add the sugar and the dry yeast ,
pour the orange juice and start mixing with the hook, then add the herbal liqueur . Start kneading for a few seconds still with the hook and then pour in 3 eggs, one at a time .
When the eggs are absorbed, stop the mixer, then add the condensed milk , then still with the hook, mix and add the last of the 4 eggs . On a cutting board, chop the dried fruit into coarse cubes
and add it to the dough , continue kneading until it starts sticking to the hook ; then add the softened butter, one tablespoon at a time
and continue working until you get a smooth and well-kneaded dough . Take the dough from the mixer and work it a little on the board, just to give it a round shape . Place it in a lightly buttered bowl and let it rise for 2-3 hours covered with plastic wrap in an off oven with the light on.
After the necessary time, the dough will have tripled in volume ; turn it out onto the board and work it with your fingertips until you get a rectangle of 6x12 inches .
Then with a dough scraper, cut the dough lengthwise , thus obtaining 3 strips , then join them at one end
so that you have the part to start braiding the three strips alternately , until you get a braid . Then place the dough in a lightly buttered 10-inch diameter cake mold
and let it rise for 1-2 hours , covered with plastic wrap away from drafts. After the necessary time, bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 50-60 minutes (if using a convection oven, 300°F for 40-50 minutes), always doing the toothpick test before removing the cake from the oven. Once baked, remove it from the oven and lightly brush with egg white then sprinkle with sugar crystals and let it cool completely before serving the fruit cake.
The fruit cake keeps for up to 3-4 days as long as it's covered; there's no need to keep it in the refrigerator. If you want to give it a little more freshness, warm the slices for a moment in the oven.
If you want to make this fruit cake even more delicious, I suggest adding chocolate chips or chopped hazelnuts if you want a crunchy touch. You can replace the condensed milk with 2 oz of honey and slightly reduce the flour.
