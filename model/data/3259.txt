The Moretta fanese is, honestly, a real gem from Italy’s Marche region—specifically from the charming town of Fano. This Italian coffee cocktail isn’t just any drink; it’s a slice of local history. Sailors from the Fano port would sip on this bold, warm, and slightly sweet concoction long ago to brace themselves before heading out to sea. At its core? The drink mixes bold espresso with anise-flavored liqueur, rum, and brandy, topped off with a hint of lemon peel. This combo gives a kick that’s aromatic and kinda tangy, with just the right boozy edge.
These days, there’s a fresh twist: anise and rum whipped into a frothy spuma. Super tasty! Sometimes, candied lemon zest adds an extra crunch and touch of sweetness. In Fano, every café seems to have its own spin on the Moretta fanese , which is great and makes it a point of local pride. You can enjoy it as a Fano specialty after a meal or as a mid-day pick-me-up. The golden foam floating perfectly atop the rich coffee? Seriously good. The candied lemon peel adds a unique flair you won’t find elsewhere.
And listen, the balance between the strong coffee and layered liquors creates a smooth, warming experience. Perfect for a Moretta recipe when hanging out with friends or savoring something distinct. Plus, it’s not just about the drink; it’s about appreciating the Adriatic coast with its rich history. So here’s the deal: next time you’re in the mood for a classic Moretta coffee with a modern twist, remember how this traditional Italian beverage has been giving folks in Fano that extra boost for years—connecting them to their roots in the most delicious way. Really, really good stuff.
To prepare the moretta fanese, start with the anise foam: mix the anise liqueur with the brandy in a small jug and with the four teaspoons of rum . Add the mix of spirits to the fresh liquid cream in a bowl and
whip everything with an electric mixer ; it will take about ten minutes because the presence of alcohol will require more time to achieve a perfect whip. Keep in mind that it will take longer than expected. Add the powdered sugar , mix and transfer the obtained foam into a piping bag with a star tip , then store it in the refrigerator for about half an hour.
In the meantime, prepare the coffee with the moka pot: to get excellent coffee, fill the boiler of your moka pot with cold water, preferably low in limescale, being careful not to exceed the safety valve (otherwise you will get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee, forming a mound that you will level by tapping the filter on the table with decisive movements (8-9). Do not press with the spoon, nor make holes on the surface.
Close the moka pot very tightly , so that the coffee does not spill from the sides as it rises, and place it on a low and steady flame to get a full-bodied coffee. As the coffee rises, a dense foam will form : we recommend not letting the coffee bubble for too long to keep its sweetness and aroma intact. Your coffee is ready: before using it, stir it directly in the moka pot with a teaspoon to make the coffee more homogeneous .
Pour about 1.4 oz of coffee into each of the 4 glass cups and place about 1.6 oz of foam on top, squeezing the piping bag to create a spiral that adheres well to the sides of the glass , then tighten the circle going upward until the glass is filled. Decorate the glass with two strips of candied lemon peel or, if unavailable, with grated lemon zest: your moretta fanese is ready!
Consume the moretta fanese immediately. You can store the anise foam in the refrigerator for one day.
