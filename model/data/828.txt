instructions:
To prepare the soft melon tart, start with the base: in a bowl, place the softened butter in pieces and start working it with an electric mixer. Once it has softened, add the sugar and continue to beat the mixture until creamy .
Add the first egg and work with the electric mixer until well absorbed. Then add the second egg and mix until fully combined. Now add the baking powder .
At this point, add a portion of the flour and mix again with the electric mixer . Then, add the remaining flour and mix with a spatula .
Once you have obtained a dense and homogeneous dough , pour it into a 9-inch smart mold, previously buttered, and level it with an offset spatula . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 25 minutes. Once ready, remove the tart from the oven and let it cool at room temperature .
While the tart is baking, you can prepare the cream: pour the milk into a saucepan and bring it to a near boil . Meanwhile, in another saucepan, place the egg yolks and sugar . Mix well with a wooden spoon and add the starch . Stir again until obtaining a homogeneous mixture, without incorporating air.
As soon as the milk starts to boil, pour a small amount into the egg mixture and stir. Then, add the rest of the milk and stir again . Return to the heat and, stirring with a whisk, cook until the cream thickens and almost reaches a boil again .
Transfer the cream into a bowl and cover with cling film directly on the surface . Let it cool first at room temperature and then in the refrigerator. When the cream is cold, take the melon: cut it in half and remove the seeds with a spoon . Using a melon baller of 0.8 inches, make about 30 balls .
Transfer them into a bowl and keep them in the fridge until ready to use. Now, take the remaining melon and scrape 3.5 oz of pulp with a spoon. Transfer it into a bowl and blend it with an immersion blender .
You should obtain a smooth pulp . Take the chilled cream from the fridge and work it with the whisk for a couple of minutes, then add the blended melon pulp and mix well with the whisk to incorporate it .
Now, invert the tart base onto a plate so that the cavity is facing up . Pour the cream inside and level it . Now take the melon balls and place them around the edge on just half of the tart .
Then add the rest to form a half-moon shape and sprinkle powdered sugar on the edge of the soft tart . Decorate with mint leaves and serve .
The soft tart with melon cream keeps well covered in the refrigerator for 2 days.
