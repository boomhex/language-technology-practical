instructions:
To prepare the beer risotto with radicchio and sausage, start by finely chopping the radicchio and dicing the onion. Put the oil and butter in a pan, let it melt, then add the onion and let it soften over low heat for 10-15 minutes. Add the crumbled sausage and let it brown, then add the radicchio and let it wilt over gentle heat, stirring occasionally. Once the radicchio is wilted, add the rice and let it toast for a couple of minutes
and then deglaze with the beer ; once the liquid has evaporated, continue cooking the risotto by adding one ladle of vegetable broth at a time until the previous liquid is completely absorbed . Cook the rice until done , season with salt and pepper, and finally add grated Parmesan (or Grana Padano) to taste, mixing it well. Let the beer risotto with radicchio and sausage rest for a minute, then plate.
