To make the amaretti and chestnut cake, first pour the egg yolks into a bowl along with the softened butter and 2.8 oz of sugar .
Add the salt and the seeds from the vanilla bean , then mix with electric beaters until you get a smooth mixture . Set aside and clean the beaters thoroughly.
Pour the egg whites into another bowl and start whipping them with the clean beaters . When they start turning white, add the remaining 2.1 oz of sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form .
Now incorporate the egg whites into the yolk mixture in 2 batches, mixing gently from the bottom up . Flour the roughly chopped marron glacé and set them aside temporarily; this way, they won't sink to the bottom during baking .
At this point, add the all-purpose flour , chestnut flour , and crumbled amaretti . Combine the dry ingredients, always mixing from the bottom up.
Also add the floured chestnuts and mix gently to incorporate them evenly .
Pour the batter into a loaf pan 9x3 inches, 2.4 inches high, buttered and floured . Bake in a pre-heated static oven at 356°F for 35-40 minutes. Check the doneness with a toothpick, then remove from the oven and let it cool slightly in the pan . Once cool, unmold your amaretti and chestnut cake and dust with powdered sugar to taste !
The amaretti and chestnut cake can be stored at room temperature for 3-4 days, covered with a cloche.
It can be frozen, preferably sliced.
If desired, you can glaze the amaretti and chestnut loaf cake with melted dark chocolate.
