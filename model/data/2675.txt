To prepare the strawberry pinwheels, start by making the dough. First, take the vanilla bean and cut it horizontally with a knife to extract the seeds . In a mixer, add the softened butter and start to whisk it together with the sugar, salt, vanilla bean seeds, and lemon zest .
Next, add the two egg yolks and whisk until the mixture is fluffy. Sift the flour, add it gradually to the mixture with a spoon , and mix the ingredients well until you get a soft but rather firm dough. Then, using a spatula, spread the mixture on a tray lined with parchment paper .
Place the mixture between two sheets of parchment paper and roll it out with a rolling pin into a rectangle measuring 11x15 inches and 1/4 inch thick . Then, put the base in the refrigerator to rest for about 10 minutes so that it firms up. After the necessary time, remove the parchment paper from the top side and start spreading the strawberry jam evenly with a spoon, leaving about 1 inch from the edge .
Using the parchment paper, start gently rolling the base and continue (without parchment paper) to form a roll . Wrap it with parchment paper and place it back in the refrigerator for another 10 minutes to slightly firm up. After the required minutes, try to shape it into a round form with your hands, adjusting it gently. Return it to the refrigerator for another 30 minutes, until the roll is perfectly hardened .
Remove the parchment paper and cut the well-firmed roll into slices with a serrated knife , so the pinwheels maintain their shape. You will get about 25 cookies this way. Place the pinwheels on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and put them in the refrigerator again for about 10 minutes . Bake in a static oven preheated to 350°F for 18 minutes (in a fan oven at 320°F for about 10 minutes) and at the end of baking, place the pinwheels on a rack to cool completely, then serve them as a tasty snack !
It is recommended to store the strawberry pinwheels in a tin can for up to 4-5 days.
