instructions:
To prepare gorgonzola pasta, first bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil to cook the pasta. Meanwhile, remove the rind from the gorgonzola and cut it into cubes . Pour the milk into a large pan and add the gorgonzola cubes . Turn on the heat and melt the cheese over low heat for about ten minutes.
Stir often and season with pepper . In the meantime, cook the penne in the boiling water . Drain the pasta al dente and transfer it directly to the pan .
Toss over very low heat for 1-2 minutes, using a little cooking water to blend the sauce with the pasta . Mix everything well and serve your gorgonzola pasta immediately !
It is recommended to consume the gorgonzola pasta as soon as it is ready. Alternatively, you can store it in the refrigerator for one day, in an airtight container.
Add a sprinkle of Parmigiano Reggiano DOP to make your gorgonzola pasta even tastier, or flavor it with a few sprigs of rosemary!
You can replace the milk with the same amount of cooking water, if you prefer, or with fresh cream, for a richer result.
