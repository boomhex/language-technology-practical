Chocolate crackle cookies are a classic American delight. Really, they offer this great mix of textures with every bite. The name "crackle" comes from the unique crackling effect you get during baking. And here's the thing: these cookies are rolled in powdered sugar before hitting the oven, which gives them their main craggy look. The secret? It’s all about melting dark chocolate gently—often with a bain-marie. Makes them richer than your typical chocolate crinkle cookies . A pinch of salt is key. Really, it balances the sweetness perfectly. So so good, whether for breakfast or as a snack with tea.
People across the U.S. just love baking chocolate crackle cookies . Not just for taste. For sure. But also for their simplicity.

It makes them a standout on any list of the best chocolate crackle cookies or holiday faves. Pretty much a must. Even though they’re straightforward to make, watching the dough balls rise and split into patterns is oddly satisfying. For real.
So whether you're a pro baker or just want a special treat with minimal effort, this chocolate crackle cookie recipe is perfect. Pair them with coffee, milk, or just enjoy them solo. Can't go wrong. Each bite is a fudgy delight with a crispy finish, making them a must-have for chocolate lovers. Really really good. The mix of flavors and textures means you'll be reaching for another before you know it. They’re bound to become a staple in your cookie lineup. And truthfully, who could resist that?
To make the chocolate crackle cookies, start by melting the dark chocolate in a bain-marie: fill a saucepan with water up to a quarter, place a bowl on top, pour in the chocolate pieces (alternatively, you can use dark chocolate chips) and cook over very low heat until the chocolate reaches a liquid consistency . Then add the butter , continuing to stir with a wooden spoon to combine everything. Continue adding the brown sugar .
Add the eggs and mix. Proceed by adding the vanilla extract or a packet of vanilla powder and mix with a whisk. Pour the flour and baking powder into a sieve and sift them directly into the saucepan .
Continue kneading with the whisk until the powders are well mixed with the rest of the mixture. Finally, add the coarse salt , then turn off the heat and transfer the mixture to a bowl. Let it cool slightly and cover with cling film , then let the dough firm up in the fridge for about 1 hour.
After this time, take the dough out of the fridge, remove the cling film, and start shaping it into small pieces, forming balls weighing about 0.35 oz . Then pour the powdered sugar into a bowl and roll the dough balls you have formed in it , then line a tray with parchment paper and place the sugared balls well spaced apart . Put the tray in the fridge and let it rest for at least half an hour.
When the balls are well cold and firm, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper always well spaced, so that during baking they do not touch, and bake in a static preheated oven at 356°F for 10-12 minutes; if using a fan oven, bake at 320°F for 5-7 minutes, until they are flat and crunchy . At this point, let them cool on a wire rack and then you can enjoy your chocolate crackle cookies one after the other!
You can store chocolate crackle cookies in a tin for 1 week. You can freeze the dough and then let it thaw at room temperature before handling it.
If “crunchier” is your mantra, no problem: you can add chopped nuts to the dough, the result will leave you speechless (busy chewing). 
A couple of technicalities: if you don't have vanilla extract, you can easily use a packet of vanilla powder or the bean; you can replace brown sugar with granulated sugar.
