The best part? It lets home cooks have fun with color while still trusting every slice to hold up—looking great , tasting even better , so everybody leaves happy! (Tip: save an extra chunk—leftovers are hot property for late-night snackers and lunchbox surprises.)
To prepare tricolor bread, dissolve the dry yeast in a little warm water (taken from the 1 cup needed for the dough) and add the malt (you can replace the malt with sugar: in this case, add it to the sifted flour). Mix with a teaspoon and add the mixture to the sifted flour placed in the bowl of a stand mixer ; work the ingredients with the flat beater at medium speed, then add the egg
and the amount of warm water indicated for the dough . Continue kneading and when the mixture is smooth, stop the mixer and replace the beater with the dough hook , add the salt
work the dough at medium speed and add the softened butter in pieces, waiting for each piece to be absorbed before adding the next . Knead the dough for at least 10 minutes until it is smooth and forms ribbons . Transfer it to a bowl , cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise in the oven turned off with the light on for at least 2 hours (it should double in volume).
Meanwhile, wash the spinach and stew them in a pan with a drizzle of oil covered with a lid (10-11). Once cooked, let them cool and then pour them into the blender
add 1 tablespoon of water and blend everything until you get a creamy mixture; then drain the cream of excess water . Then take back the dough that has doubled in volume
transfer it to a lightly oiled work surface and divide it into three parts (you can wrap the ones not in use at the moment in plastic wrap) and season one with the spinach , kneading to incorporate them evenly . Then butter and line a 12x4.5 inch loaf pan with parchment paper and place the green dough inside .
Continue handling the plain dough to shape it into a log the same size as the pan and place it on top of the green dough in the pan. Then season the last part of the dough with the tomato paste and paprika .
Proceed in the same way and lay the red dough in the pan . Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for at least 30 minutes away from drafts. After the necessary time, bake the tricolor bread in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 60 minutes (356°F for 50 minutes if using a convection oven). Check the cooking with a skewer before finishing baking; when the tricolor bread is cooked, take it out of the oven and let it cool for at least 20 minutes in the pan and then invert it onto a rack to cool completely!
You can store tricolor bread in a food-safe bag for 1-2 days. You can freeze the dough after the first rise and, when needed, thaw it in the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature.
Tricolor bread, once ready, is excellent as a base for sandwiches filled with soft cheeses and delicately flavored cold cuts; great with prosciutto.
