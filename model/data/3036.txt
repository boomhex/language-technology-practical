To make the coffee and cardamom truffles, start by preparing the coffee with the moka pot: fill the boiler of your moka pot with cold water, preferably low in limescale, making sure not to exceed the safety valve (otherwise you will get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee forming a mound that you level by tapping the filter on the table with firm movements (2-3). Do not press with a spoon, nor make holes on the surface.
Close the moka pot very tightly , so that the coffee does not spill over the sides as it rises, and place it on a low and steady flame to get a full-bodied coffee. As the coffee rises, a dense foam will form : we advise you not to let the coffee bubble for too long to keep its sweetness and aroma intact. Your coffee is ready: before using it, stir it directly in the moka with a spoon to make the coffee more homogeneous . Once ready, set the coffee aside.
Now chop the dark chocolate and milk chocolate with a knife (or if you prefer, in a mixer) and place everything in a bowl. Put a saucepan on the stove, add the heavy cream , butter, cardamom powder
and stir with a spoon , heat everything and then also add the previously prepared moka coffee . Pour the mixture into the bowl containing the chopped chocolate and
stir with a whisk so that the chocolate melts, thus obtaining a ganache . At this point, cover the bowl with plastic wrap in contact with the surface of the mixture and let it cool in the refrigerator for about 3 hours so that it solidifies, it should not harden too much otherwise you will have difficulty working it.
After the necessary time for the chocolate mixture to set, sift the cocoa powder into a bowl, add the coffee powder to this and start to compose your truffles: take small portions of the chocolate mixture (about 0.5 oz) and form walnut-sized balls with your hands , to make it easier to form compact balls, moisten your hands.
Once each truffle is created, roll it in the bowl with cocoa and coffee powder (19-20), once ready, place it on a tray lined with parchment paper . Work the balls quickly to prevent the heat of your hands from softening the dough too much. Proceed in this way until the mixture is used up, with the indicated doses you will get about 25 truffles. Now that your coffee and cardamom truffles are ready, enjoy them with a good cup of coffee.
Store the coffee and cardamom truffles in the refrigerator in an airtight container for about 5 days. It is possible to freeze the truffles in the freezer and then thaw them in the refrigerator when needed.
You can replace the cardamom with other flavors of your liking such as cinnamon or vanilla. To make the coffee and cardamom truffles even more delicious, you can wrap the balls in hazelnut crumbs or chocolate flakes.
