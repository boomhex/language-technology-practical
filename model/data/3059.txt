To prepare the red currant and blueberry jam, start by gently removing the currants from the stems and place them in a small bowl . Also prepare a small bowl for the blueberries . Wash the currants well under running water first and then
the blueberries . Get a food mill with large holes and place it over a large bowl to collect the fruit juice; pour the currants into the food mill and pass them through several times, turning gently ,
to extract the juice and pulp of the currants . Pour the blueberries into the food mill ; also pass them through several times with slow movements ,
to obtain the juice and pulp of the blueberries . In a tall and large stainless steel pot, pour first the currant pulp and then the blueberry pulp .
These operations should be done with the heat turned off . Add a packet of 1:1 jam sugar, cold , stir and bring everything to a boil, stirring continuously. When the mixture reaches boiling point, let it boil for 1 minute, continuing to stir .
After 1 minute, add the sugar and bring the mixture back to a boil. Boil for 3 minutes on high heat , always stirring. Remove the pot from the heat and keep stirring so that any foam created on the surface ,
completely dissolves . Prepare the jars, which you have sanitized, and get a funnel to facilitate jarring the jam . Pour the still boiling jam, with the help of a ladle and
fill the container, making sure to leave 0.4 inches (1 cm) from the rim , then with suitable lids, close them , tightening well and ensuring they are hermetically sealed. With the heat from the jam, a vacuum will be created, allowing the product to be stored for a long time. Once the jars have cooled down, check if the vacuum has been correctly formed: you can press the center of the lid and, if you don't hear the classic "click-clack", the vacuum has been formed.

The red currant and blueberry jam can be stored in a cool, dry place away from light and heat sources for about 12 months. Once opened, the red currant and blueberry jam should be stored in the refrigerator and consumed within a few days; for this reason, we recommend storing the jam in small jars so that the contents are quickly used up once opened.
You can add other berries, wild strawberries, or raspberries to the red currant and blueberry jam according to your tastes: just adjust the quantities so that the total fruit amounts to 2.2 pounds (1 kg).
Homemade preserves and jams can pose health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the necessary conditions and measures to ensure the safety and suitability of the food, which, on the contrary, industrial procedures can guarantee to prevent dangerous contaminations. It is therefore important to follow food safety guidelines carefully to reduce risks, but one must always keep in mind that the same level of food safety cannot be achieved as with preserves and jams produced professionally. For a correct preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
