Wash the potatoes and, without peeling them, boil them whole by placing them in a pot covered with cold water . Once it reaches a boil, salt the water and let them boil for about 40 minutes, or until they are cooked. As soon as they are slightly cooled, peel the potatoes and place them in a large bowl . Also boil the broccoli; if using fresh broccoli, first rinse them under running water and trim them, then boil in salted water and drain them while still al dente .
Then mash the potatoes with a fork. Add the well-dried broccoli to the bowl and mash them as well .
Once you have a fairly creamy mixture, add salt, white pepper, an egg, 100 grams (about 3.5 oz) of grated Emmental cheese , breadcrumb (if the mixture turns out to be rather sticky, you can add another tablespoon of breadcrumb; otherwise, remove one), and the remaining Emmental cheese cut into small cubes .
Mix everything by hand and let the mixture rest for 5 minutes: taste the mixture and adjust the salt if necessary. Take about 50-60 grams (about 1.75-2 oz) of the mixture , place a cherry tomato in the center , and cover it, forming a spherical croquette (12-13).
Prepare three small bowls with wheat flour, corn flour, and the two beaten eggs inside and roll the prepared croquettes first in the wheat flour .
Then in the beaten egg and finally in the corn flour . Place abundant peanut oil in a high-sided pan and heat it; when it is hot, immerse the croquettes and let them brown, turning them with a pair of forks. Drain the now-golden croquettes and let them drip on a plate lined with kitchen paper. Serve the croquettes as soon as they are warm.
