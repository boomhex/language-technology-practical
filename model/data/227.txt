instructions:
To prepare seared scallops on pea puree, first shell all the fresh peas and blanch them in boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes .
Immediately cool them in ice water , then take half and transfer them to a container with a little water .
Season with a pinch of salt , then blend everything with an immersion blender to obtain a smooth, lump-free puree .
Remove the skin from the remaining shelled and blanched peas, season with oil and salt , and set aside. Blanch the mint leaves in salted water for a moment, just long enough to soften them .
Drain the mint leaves and transfer them to ice water to cool them while maintaining the vibrant green color. Squeeze the mint leaves well and place them in the mixer glass with 2 tablespoons of oil .
Blend with an immersion blender to obtain a homogeneous sauce . Strain the mint oil through a fine-mesh strainer lined with a paper towel , then set aside.
In a non-stick pan, sauté the prosciutto over medium heat for a couple of minutes , until crispy . Transfer the prosciutto to a platter .
In the same pan, add a drizzle of oil and sear the scallops on both sides for a couple of minutes, or until they are golden brown on the surface . Once ready, place them on a paper towel.
At this point, you can assemble the dish: pour the pea puree in the center , place the scallops , and distribute the peeled and seasoned peas .
Add the crispy prosciutto pieces and finish with a few drops of mint oil . Garnish with a few fresh mint leaves and serve your seared scallops on pea puree immediately .
It is recommended to consume the scallops on pea puree immediately.
You can prepare the pea puree and mint-infused oil in advance and store them in the refrigerator for up to one day.
For an even smoother puree, you can pass the blended peas through a sieve.
If you prefer, instead of prosciutto, you can use speck or smoked bacon.
