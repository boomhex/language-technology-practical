instructions:
To prepare the strawberry grape liqueur, start by removing the grapes from the stems ; place them in a colander and rinse well under cold running water . Put the washed grapes on a tray and quickly dry them with a kitchen towel .
In a bowl, lightly crush the grapes with a fork , then place them in a large airtight glass jar . Add the cinnamon and cloves ;
add 5 oz of sugar , then cover with the alcohol . Seal the jar tightly and shake well to dissolve the sugar .
After this step, let everything macerate for a month in a cool, dark place, turning the jar from time to time . After the month , dissolve 5 oz of sugar in a saucepan over medium heat with 1 1/4 cups of water ;
boil for 2 minutes and then turn off the heat, allowing the syrup to cool. Meanwhile, strain the contents of the glass jar through a fine-mesh sieve , pressing the strawberry grapes well to extract all the juice ;
finally, add the now cold syrup and mix the liqueur well . Use a funnel to pour the liqueur you have obtained into sterilized bottles with airtight caps . Let the strawberry grape liqueur rest for at least 10 days in a cool, dark place before consuming.
Store the strawberry grape liqueur in a cool, dark place.
If you, like me, are a fan of spices, I suggest trying to replace the cinnamon and cloves with cardamom or wild fennel! If you want a milder flavor, you can enjoy the strawberry liqueur plain, omitting the spices.
