Square spaghetti , or "spaghetti quadrati" as they say in Italy, is such a cool twist on pasta shapes. It takes its cue from the classic spaghetti alla chitarra you'll find around Central Italy. So here's the thing: those edges? They’re perfect for clinging to fresh tomato sauce . When cherry tomatoes hit their sweet spot in the summer, Italians go for a splash of olive oil and fresh basil. Really, it’s all about keeping it light, letting those tender tomatoes shine through—so so fresh.
Now, the magic part: chunky mozzarella cheese on top. Each forkful gives you that creamy, moist melt. And it mingles with the juicy tomatoes and hearty pasta. Seriously good. In Central Italy, especially when it's warm, this dish is everywhere because it lets seasonal ingredients really shine. The combination of fresh tomato sauce , square spaghetti, and mozzarella cheese is simple yet has this rustic flair.
And look, unlike tonnarelli, another traditional noodle, square spaghetti has a rough surface that grabs all those golden bits of sauce. Adding fresh basil? Which is great—boosts the aroma and makes the dish smell so fresh and inviting. It’s the kind of meal you’d wanna share with friends on a warm day. Pretty simple, right? And really really delicious.
Recipes like this show why Italian pasta recipes are amazing. High-quality ingredients, keeping it simple, and letting those flavors be different. Whether it’s a light lunch or a starter for a bigger meal, this mozzarella-topped pasta is gonna make your summer dining fun and a bit crispy around the edges. Plus, it totally embraces traditional Italian culinary wisdom, showing how simplicity and quality can create something memorable. And you know what? Can't go wrong with that.
