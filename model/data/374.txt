Pasta with pesto and cherry tomatoes is, honestly, what summer tastes like in Liguria. And look, in this beautiful part of Italy, folks really know how to keep things light, fresh, and super tasty when it gets hot. The star of the show? It’s the pesto pasta recipe using true Ligurian basil pesto —made from fragrant basil, pine nuts, Parmigiano or Pecorino, garlic, and really good extra virgin olive oil. I mean, folks here take their pesto super seriously, but these days, you know, it’s common to use a mixer instead of a mortar to get that creamy sauce in less time. And the cherry tomatoes? Tossing in sweet ones right at the end keeps things juicy and adds a pop of color. You’ll find this cherry tomatoes pasta at lunchtime, outdoor picnics, or whenever someone craves something a bit special but not fussy. It’s a dish that shows off Mediterranean flavors—herby, zesty, and full of sunshine.
Throughout Liguria, little tweaks make every pasta with pesto just a bit different. And here’s the deal: some versions use trofie, while others go with penne or spaghetti—whatever’s handy, really. The key is the contrast: that cool, moist pesto and those crisp, almost sweet cherry tomatoes. It’s the kind of food that works hot, warm, or even cold—which is why people love bringing it to potlucks or turning leftovers into a cold vegetarian pasta dish for the next day. This is pretty much the go-to when you want something fast but still crave bold, fresh flavors. From the salty cheese to the tender noodles and the sharp basil, every bite gives you a little of what makes Italian summers so, so great. For anyone who loves quick pasta recipes or a homemade pesto sauce, this is a way to get real Ligurian taste on your table, no matter where you are. It’s simple, bright, and perfect for long, lazy evenings or quick lunches that feel like a treat. Whether you’re enjoying it in a bustling city or a quiet countryside, this dish brings a taste of Liguria’s sun-drenched coast right to your plate. Really, no question.
