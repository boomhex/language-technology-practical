Prosciutto glassato —I mean, this dish just brings everyone together, right when it comes out of the oven. Really good stuff. This glazed ham has its roots in Ireland but has become a beloved choice for family gatherings in the U.S. You know, the secret lies in the slow-cooking method. The pork leg is stewed with spices and just a touch of sweetness, making the meat so so tender and packed with flavor. Pretty simple, but it works.
After slow-cooking, it's coated with a shiny glaze made from honey and orange, giving it a sweet and slightly tangy crust. Perfect for celebrating. And look, some folks go for blackberry or cranberry jam in the glaze. It's a popular twist at American Christmas dinners and really shows the versatility of a great ham glaze recipe that enhances holiday meals.
During festive seasons, a baked ham like this always steals the spotlight. And the glaze? It turns golden and slightly crispy, making each slice the perfect balance of moist inside and sticky-sweet outside. Can't go wrong there. Everyone's got their own take—some add brown sugar for that rich brown sugar ham glaze flavor, while others go for citrus for a fresh kick. In both Ireland and the U.S., this dish really signifies good times and hearty company.
Leftovers? They're just as delicious the next day. For sure. You’ll discover this holiday ham pairs beautifully with various sides, from roasted veggies to potatoes, or even a light salad. Honestly, no matter how you serve it, this ham draws people together and keeps the festive spirit alive. From the mouthwatering aroma in the kitchen to the last bite at the table—it's more than just a meal; it's a tradition that comes from warmth and togetherness with every savory, sweet mouthful. Really, really special.
To prepare the glazed ham, crush the juniper berries . Then take a large pan, drizzle it with a bit of oil, and place the leg in: then add the bay leaves previously rinsed under running water, and a tablespoon of fennel seeds .
Then also add the peppercorns , the crushed juniper berries, the star anise , and the celery stalk .
Then add the carrots, previously peeled and roughly chopped , the onions peeled and quartered, and the peeled garlic cloves . Then pour water into the pan until the ham is covered.
Pour a tablespoon of coarse salt , then cover the pan with a lid, without sealing it completely, and cook for at least three hours, occasionally turning the leg to flavor it evenly. Once cooking is complete , the leg should cool completely in the same pan. Meanwhile, you can prepare the glaze: squeeze the juice of one orange .
In a small pan, pour the honey, add the cinnamon and sweet paprika , then pour in the orange juice and mix the ingredients.
Cook the sauce over low heat and continue mixing with a whisk : the glaze should become quite fluid. Now that the meat and sauce are ready, you can remove the skin from the ham with a knife . Then, with the same knife, you can score the surface to form diamonds .
At this point, place the ham in a baking dish lined with parchment paper. At the intersections of the oblique cuts, insert the cloves to create a neat, geometric decoration. Then carefully brush the ham with the glaze using a kitchen brush . Then bake in a preheated static oven at 480°F for 30 minutes (445°F for 20-25 minutes if using a convection oven). When ready, you'll have a succulent glazed ham to serve at the table!
You can store the ham in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container for 1-2 days. You can also prepare it the day before, store it in the refrigerator, and proceed with the glazing the next day. Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer an even more American version, you can serve the ham with cranberry or blackberry jam.
You can omit some spices if you don't prefer them.
