This summer we have a very special first course in store for you: a risotto with figs , simple and with sweet notes, an unusual but appetizing way to taste these delicious sugary fruits, in a tantalizing savory dress. Very few ingredients, just enough to guarantee a crunchy touch, here given by the almonds, and a pinch of creaminess made by creaming with oil and Parmesan. The result is a refined risotto that will brighten up your summer menus with taste!
To prepare risotto with figs , start with the broth: fill a large pot with water and season with pepper, the peeled shallot and bay leaves . Bring to a boil, then keep warm. In another pan pour a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil , a few grains of Sichuan pepper and toast for a couple of minutes. Pour the rice into the pan and toast for about 3 minutes, until hot.
Salt the rice and sprinkle with a couple of ladles of broth. Cook for about 5 minutes over medium heat adding broth as needed . In the meantime, peel the figs (without peeling them) and cut them into pieces of about 0.75" (2 cm) . Keep one aside to garnish the dishes.
After 5 minutes pour the figs and mix. Bring the rice to cook by adding broth as needed. Turn off the heat and stir in a drizzle of olive oil .
Flavor with grated Parmesan . Mix well . Coarsely chop the almonds .
Cut a fig into wedges and serve your risotto with figs garnishing the dishes with almonds and fresh fig .
It is preferable to taste the freshly made dish.
For a more delicious version, add raw ham cut into strips, lightly toasted or smoked bacon.
