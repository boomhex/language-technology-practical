instructions:
To prepare the custard with whole eggs, first pour the milk into a saucepan and add the vanilla extract . Heat the milk over low heat until it's about to boil. Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a pot, add the sugar , and whisk until the mixture becomes light .
Add the cornstarch and whisk again to obtain a creamy, lump-free mixture. At this point, off the heat, gradually add the milk , stirring continuously throughout the process. Once all the milk is incorporated, put the pot back on low heat, and continue to stir while cooking for another 5 minutes.
When the mixture has thickened , transfer it to a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap, making sure it is in contact with the custard . Place it in the fridge and let it cool. Your custard with whole eggs is ready to be used .
The custard with whole eggs can be stored in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for a maximum of 2-3 days.
It can be frozen.
As an alternative to vanilla extract, you can flavor the custard with vanilla bean or lemon zest. If you prefer a thicker custard, you can cook it a little longer, always stirring. If you want it more fluid, slightly reduce the cooking time or add a bit more milk. Sift the cornstarch before adding it; this will help prevent lumps and result in a smoother, more homogeneous custard.
