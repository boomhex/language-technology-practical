So, let's talk about the Jerusalem bagel . It's like a whole different vibe from your usual New York or Montreal bagels. This Middle Eastern bread is all about its unique oval shape —kind of like a stretched-out doughnut. And inside? It’s super soft and fluffy. Really really nice. Plus, the crust is tender.
What makes the Jerusalem bagel —or ka'ak al-Quds —stand out is all those sesame seeds or spices thrown on just before baking. Seriously good stuff. That extra sprinkle adds a crispy texture and a mildly sweet, aromatic flavor. And when it comes out of the oven? The aroma is incredible.
In Jerusalem and across the Middle East, this bread has been a thing for centuries. Like, it's classic street food there. You grab one hot and fresh from vendors and dip it in za’atar—which is awesome. And look, some bakers toss in powdered milk, making it extra moist and soft. You get this touch of sweetness that plays off the nutty, toasty sesame. When you throw in some za’atar, the mix of tangy and savory is just... So so good.
For real, while there are loads of breads worldwide, this one is something special. Its ancient roots and classic Middle Eastern bread flavors are fascinating. Can you believe how a sesame bagel has become such a key part of daily life? It's perfect for breakfast, a snack, or just because that fresh-baked smell from the street cart is irresistible.
Every bite is packed with history and tradition, offering flavors and textures that are totally traditional yet super unique. Honestly, the Jerusalem bagel is a real treat for anyone who loves exploring new tastes. I mean, it captures a rich culinary heritage, making it a must-try for anyone diving into the diverse flavors of the Middle East.
To prepare the Jerusalem bagel, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a hook, or in a large bowl if kneading by hand, mix the flour, sugar, and powdered milk (1-2). With a small portion of warm water, dissolve the yeast in a small bowl and
add it to the dry ingredients . Dissolve the salt in the remaining water and add it to the dough as well, pouring it in slowly while kneading . Finally, add the oil and let it knead until the dough is well-bound, detaches well from the sides, and has completely absorbed all the liquids.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface , knead it again with your hands, then form a ball and place it in a bowl, covered with plastic wrap . Let the dough rise in the oven with the light on for about 2 hours, until it has doubled in size .
Once risen, turn the bagel dough onto the work surface and divide it into 5 pieces, each weighing about 7.8 oz. Shape each piece into a rope about 31 inches long, then join the two ends, pressing them lightly to close the oval .
Place the formed Jerusalem bagels on a baking tray lined with parchment paper ; brush them with a beaten egg and sprinkle the surface with a handful of sesame seeds and sugar .
If you have Za'atar available, you can sprinkle it on the surface of the bagels . Let rise for another hour or so , then bake the bagels in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 15 minutes (if fan-assisted, at 356°F for 12 minutes). When the Jerusalem bagels are golden, take them out, let them cool slightly, and taste them!
Store the Jerusalem bagel, once cooled, in food bags for up to 3 days. It is also possible to freeze the Jerusalem bagel once baked, thaw it in the fridge, and warm it in the oven before eating.
If you don't have powdered milk, you can omit it. You can sprinkle the Jerusalem bagel with black sesame or poppy seeds if you prefer. This slightly sweet dough is excellent for accompanying cold cuts. You can sprinkle the Bagel with only sesame, without sugar, if you don't like it.
