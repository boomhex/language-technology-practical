instructions:
To prepare the sole rolls with prosciutto, cut the sole fillets in half and place them on a cutting board (if you purchased a whole sole, you will need to clean and fillet it; you can follow our guide How to clean the sole ). Salt and season the fillets with grated lemon zest and sprigs of dill .
Cut the prosciutto into thin slices the size of the sole fillets and place them on top of each fillet . Roll up the fillet to form a roll .
Then clean the leek by removing the ends and the outer leaves; after taking off the first layer of leaves, take one and use it to create strips that will help secure the rolls. Cut the leek lengthwise to obtain thin threads to wrap around the roll . Heat the oil in a pan and sauté the garlic for a few minutes , just long enough to flavor the oil,
remove the garlic with tongs and place the rolls in the pot . Cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes.
then season with pink peppercorns and chopped dill . The sole rolls with prosciutto are ready to be served hot !
It is recommended to consume the sole rolls with prosciutto immediately. If there are leftovers, store them in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to a couple of days. You can freeze the rolls if you have used fresh, not previously frozen, ingredients.
You can replace sole with other fillets like plaice, and if you don't like dill, you can substitute it with parsley or mint.
