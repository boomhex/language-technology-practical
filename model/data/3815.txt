instructions:
To prepare tonnarelli with arugula pesto, start by bringing the pasta water to a boil. Meanwhile, prepare the pesto: after washing and drying the arugula well, transfer it to a blender, to which you add the pine nuts , salt, garlic, Grana Padano DOP , and half the amount of olive oil .
Blend intermittently, adding the remaining oil gradually, little by little, until you reach the desired creamy consistency . Once ready, proceed to cook the tonnarelli in salted boiling water to taste ; then transfer the pesto to a non-stick pan.
When the pasta is al dente, before draining it, mix the pesto with a ladle of cooking water . Then drain the pasta and sauté it for a few moments in the arugula pesto over high heat . Your tonnarelli with arugula pesto is ready to be served .
You can store the arugula pesto in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap for 3-4 days. Divided into portions, you can also freeze it in small jars with screw lids.
If you want to make the arugula pesto lighter, you can omit the garlic. Try replacing the pine nuts with walnut kernels, or the Grana Padano DOP with pecorino: you can really customize the dressing as you like!
