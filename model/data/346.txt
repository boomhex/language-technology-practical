instructions:
To prepare the chestnuts in the pan, first make a cross-cut on the top of the chestnuts . Place them in a bowl, cover them with cold water , and let them soak for 15 minutes .
Drain and dry the chestnuts. Transfer them to a thick-bottomed pan, arranging them in a single layer , cover with a lid , and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally. The chestnuts should be well roasted, but soft inside, this happens because of the steam that develops in the pan thanks to the lid. Your chestnuts in the pan are ready to be enjoyed .
The chestnuts in the pan are best stored in an airtight container at room temperature for 1-2 days. To keep them soft, you can wrap them in a damp cloth inside the container. If you prefer to enjoy them warm, you can briefly reheat them in a pan or microwave before serving.
When they are warm, it's much easier to peel them. To get perfectly cooked chestnuts, it's important to make a deep cut on the top of each chestnut to prevent them from exploding during cooking. Soaking them in water before cooking helps keep them soft inside.
