Ricotta and escarole pouches —so so tasty—are a must-try snack you'll find all over Campania . You know, when you're looking for something special but still kinda practical. And look, the combo of tender escarole, sweet uvetta, and crunchy pine nuts mixed with creamy, mild ricotta? It's really really something. Every bite is moist inside, while the outside stays crispy and golden. And here's the thing: in southern Italy, escarole goes by "scarola" or "indivia." You’ll see it in markets pretty much all year long.
These ricotta and escarole pouches —seriously good—shine with simple, local ingredients. Just flour, water, salt and oil make the dough, turning them into something that feels quite fancy. Usually, these pockets are served warm. I mean, they’re great by the fireplace or perfect to pack for a picnic with friends.
In Campania, those regional touches? They matter a lot. You’ll find different takes on the classic ricotta escarole recipe . Some people add extra pine nuts for a stronger nutty bite or toss in more raisins for a sweet surprise. The dough is rolled out thin, creating a crispy shell that matches the creamy filling inside just right. When you bite in, you'll get the balance between the soft ricotta and the gentle bitterness of the escarole, with that pop from the dried fruit. So good!
These stuffed escarole with ricotta bundles are perfect as appetizers at family gatherings. Or, you know, they're ideal for buffets if made small, so people can just grab one and go. It's comfort food that really shows what Italian stuffed escarole can do—keeping it simple and fresh is key. Folks in Campania love these in a big meal, but honestly, they are just as awesome solo. Especially when you want something warm and filling with that special touch. Whether part of a festive spread or enjoyed quietly at home, these pouches capture the heart of Italian culinary tradition, focusing on fresh, seasonal and local ingredients. For sure.
To prepare the ricotta and escarole pouches, start by preparing the dough. First, sift the flour into a large bowl , then add the salt and the oil .
Add the lukewarm water and start kneading with your hands . Once all the liquids are absorbed, transfer the mixture to a work surface and knead until you get a smooth dough . Then wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature .
Meanwhile, start preparing the filling. Roughly chop the escarole , wash it thoroughly and let it drain slightly. Sauté a clove of garlic in a pan with a drizzle of oil, then add the escarole , salt, pepper, and let it wilt for about 7 minutes, covering it with a lid and stirring occasionally .
In the meantime, rinse the raisins well and soak them in cold water to revive them . Once the escarole is wilted, remove the garlic and pass it through a colander over a bowl to eliminate the excess water .
Squeeze it slightly to further eliminate the water , the escarole should be quite dry to prevent the filling from leaking during cooking. Transfer it to a large bowl and also add: the ricotta, the pine nuts , the previously drained raisins , the salt, the ground pepper, and thyme leaves. Mix everything to combine well.
After 30 minutes, take the dough back, remove the plastic wrap, place it on a floured surface, and start rolling it out with a rolling pin . Once you have a thin sheet, cut out 6 discs with a 7-inch cookie cutter and place a generous tablespoon of filling in the center of each disc .
At this point, brush the edges of the disc with a little water, which will act as a glue . Close the disc by bringing the edges to the center and gently pinching them to seal . To give a decorative pattern, make pleats by overlapping the edges of the dough .
Place the pouches on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and brush them with a little oil . Use up all the ingredients, then bake at 392°F in a static oven for 30 minutes, or in a convection oven at 356°F for 20 minutes. To be sure that the cooking times are accurate, try baking just one pouch first . Serve the ricotta and escarole pouches warm .
You can store your ricotta and escarole pouches for a maximum of one day in the refrigerator in an airtight container. Alternatively, you can freeze them once cooked and heat them when needed.
If the ricotta and escarole mixture is too moist, add some breadcrumbs or alternatively some Parmesan cheese to enhance the flavor even more!
