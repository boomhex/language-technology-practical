Panzerotti alla crema di pomodori secchi e scamorza comes from the beautiful region of Apulia in Southern Italy. Here, crafting delicious stuffed pastries is a tradition. These fried turnovers? A must at street parties and family gatherings. They show up hot and crispy from the fryer. Filled to the brim with a mix that's really good, they just ooze out when you break them open. The star? Sun-dried tomato cream . It delivers a punch of tangy flavor that perfectly complements the gooey, smoky scamorza cheese . Sometimes, anchovies sneak in to add a salty kick—locals love that combo. The outside gets that perfect golden crunch, while the inside stays warm and tender. Each bite is a mix of crunchy, melty, and rich goodness. In Apulia, strong tastes are the norm. And listen, this panzerotti recipe doesn’t disappoint. What makes them special is the super thin dough. It fries up light and lets the filling shine. Serve them hot, right after frying. Seriously, the cheese stays molten and stretchy inside—that’s the part everyone fights over. These aren’t just any snacks; they’re the kind of traditional Italian appetizers that make a table feel full of friends, even if it’s just a small gathering.

Homemade panzerotti have that special moist and crunchy texture that store-bought versions can't match. If you’re into easy Italian recipes with tons of flavor, these panzerotti are as good as it gets. For sure. So why not try making them at home and bring a taste of Apulia to your table?

To prepare the sun-dried tomato cream and smoked cheese panzerotti, start with the sun-dried tomato cream; blend the tomatoes together with their oil in a mixer with blades until you get a thick and homogeneous cream which you will transfer into a bowl .
Cut the smoked scamorza cheese into cubes , then pat the anchovies dry with paper towels to remove their oil. Once the filling is ready, take one disk of dough at a time and fill it with a teaspoon of the sun-dried tomato cream you prepared ;
add a few cheese cubes and a fillet of anchovy . Brush the edges with some egg white ,
then fold the disks in half , pressing well with your fingers to create a half-moon; seal the edges with the tines of a fork and proceed in this way until you have used up all the ingredients .
Heat the frying oil in a wide pan . When the oil reaches a temperature of 356°F (you can check with a kitchen thermometer), fry 2-3 panzerotti at a time until they become golden and crunchy .
Drain the excess oil from the panzerotti with a slotted spoon and let them dry on paper towels . Once finished , you can serve and enjoy your sun-dried tomato cream and smoked cheese panzerotti hot .
It is recommended to consume the sun-dried tomato cream and smoked cheese panzerotti immediately while hot. Freezing is not recommended.
