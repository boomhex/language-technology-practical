To prepare the chaffles, first grate the provolone cheese with a large-hole grater , then beat the eggs in a bowl with a whisk . Pour the grated cheese into the bowl with the eggs .
Mix everything with the whisk . At this point, heat a waffle iron to a medium-high temperature and brush both sides with melted butter or oil , then pour in the mixture using a spoon .
After adding the batter , close the waffle iron and cook for 4-5 minutes. After this time, open the iron and use a spatula to remove the chaffles. Serve the chaffles hot with a pat of butter !
Chaffles can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
As an alternative to provolone, you can also choose another type of cheese depending on how you intend to consume the chaffles: for a sweet breakfast, for example, you can use pizza mozzarella which has a more neutral taste, while for a savory sandwich you can opt for cheddar!
If desired, you can flavor the batter with turmeric or paprika to add a spicy note.
