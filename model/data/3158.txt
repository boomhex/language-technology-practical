instructions:
To prepare the coffee diplomatic cream, first pour 1 cup of milk into a saucepan and bring it to a boil. The other 1/6 cup will be used later. At this point, add the instant coffee and stir off the heat until it has completely dissolved .
In a bowl, pour the egg yolks and the sugar and beat with a whisk. Add the cornstarch and stir again until you get a lump-free mixture.
Gradually add the coffee milk into the bowl with the yolk mixture , stir, and pour back into the saucepan . Bring it back to the heat until the cream has thickened . It will take a couple of minutes.
To stop the cooking, immerse the saucepan in a bowl with ice water . Stir the cream quickly until it is no longer hot; it should be around 122°F. Set aside for a moment and soak the gelatin in cold water . Pour the cold heavy cream into a bowl and whip it with electric beaters ,
until you have obtained a frothy consistency . Pour the remaining 1/6 cup of milk into a saucepan , heat it, and as soon as it reaches a boil, turn off the heat. Drain the gelatin, gently squeeze it, and pour it into the milk .
Stir until it is completely dissolved , then pour everything into the saucepan with the coffee cream , continuing to stir with a whisk to incorporate it. When the cream reaches a temperature of 86°F, you can incorporate the whipped cream.
Add a spoonful at a time and gently mix until you get a homogeneous consistency .
Transfer the coffee diplomatic cream into a baking dish , cover with plastic wrap in contact , and let it cool in the refrigerator before using it .
Store the coffee diplomatic cream in an airtight container in the refrigerator for about 3 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
Instead of instant coffee, you can use 0.7 oz of moka coffee, reducing the amount of milk by the same amount.
