To make the chili pepper cream, be sure to wear latex gloves throughout the preparation process. Wash the chili peppers under fresh running water and then clean them: using a small knife, remove the stem , then cut them in half lengthwise ;
remove the flesh and seeds and then set the chili peppers aside. Sprinkle 2 1/2 oz of salt on a tray lined with a dry cloth and lay the cleaned chili peppers side by side .
Once laid out, sprinkle the entire surface with the remaining salt you have set aside, distributing it evenly over all the chili peppers ; when you have finished , cover everything with another cloth or a tray .
Leave the chili peppers covered for 1 or 2 days, so they lose their water , then with the help of a brush, carefully remove the excess salt from each chili pepper . Once this operation is complete, take the garlic clove, cut it in half, and use a knife to remove the core .
Place the cleaned chili peppers in the bowl of a food processor along with the garlic clove , add the oil in a stream, and then blend until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream . At this point, you can decide whether to consume the chili pepper cream immediately or store it for a long time: in this case, sanitize an airtight jar, then fill it with the cream and close the lid ; the vacuum sealing will have occurred if you hear a "pop" when pulling the tab, otherwise, it is recommended not to consume.
You can consume the chili pepper cream immediately or store it in an airtight jar. Once jarred and vacuum-sealed, the cream can be stored for up to 30 days in a cool place away from direct light.

The origins of this chili pepper cream date back to the period following the discovery of America when the trade of this vegetable began to intensify; since chili peppers, unlike other spices (which were more expensive), could be purchased cheaply and also grown very easily, people began to use them for food preservation and especially to flavor dishes.
Homemade preparation of preserves and jams can pose health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the necessary conditions and measures to ensure the safety and suitability of the food, which, on the contrary, industrial procedures are able to guarantee to prevent dangerous contamination. It is therefore important to scrupulously follow food safety guidelines to reduce risks, but it must always be kept in mind that you will never achieve the same food safety as professionally produced preserves and jams. For correct preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
