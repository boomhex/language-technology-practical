Can't go wrong.
To prepare the Benevento cardoon, start by preparing the Chicken broth . In the meantime, proceed to clean the cardoon (gobbo variety): remove the outer and tougher ribs keeping the inner ones, which are tender. Wash them thoroughly and remove the filaments using a vegetable peeler . Cut the ribs into pieces
and immerse them in cold acidulated water, squeezing a lemon into it to prevent browning . Meanwhile, work on the meatballs. In a bowl, mix together the minced meat, salt, and pepper, grated Parmesan cheese, and breadcrumbs . Then add the slightly beaten eggs
and mix everything well until you get a soft but compact dough. Form meatballs of about 0.35 oz each (this way you should get about 30) and keep them in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap until the broth is ready .
After draining the chicken, cook the meatballs in the pot with the chicken broth for about 10 minutes , then add the well-drained cardoons and cook for another 15-20 minutes . While the meatballs and cardoons are cooking in the broth, shred the chicken with your hands, reducing it into small strips .
Add these to the broth as well . Finally, break the eggs into a bowl and mix with a pinch of salt and grated Parmesan cheese .
Pour the mixture into the pot and cook for another 7-8 minutes, stirring occasionally . At this point, the Benevento cardoon is ready, and you just need to serve it very hot .
It is recommended to consume the Benevento cardoon immediately, but it can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of 1-2 days, keeping it in a glass container and covered with plastic wrap, if you have used very fresh ingredients. Freezing is not recommended.
Cardoons taste similar to artichokes but are more delicate and less bitter than artichokes; to make them even more tender and sweet, you can blanch them 1 or 2 times in salted boiling water, or in milk.
How to make the Benevento cardoon even tastier? Add a dice of mixed nuts, such as pine nuts, walnuts, and almonds! Or a bit of freshness with some freshly chopped parsley.
The cardoon, like its "cousin" the artichoke, is part of the wild cardoon family. There are several varieties cultivated for culinary use, all subjected to the "blanching" practice, meaning growth in the absence of light. The "gobbo" cardoon we used in the recipe takes this shape because for blanching, the plant is bent to bury it in lateral holes relative to where it's planted, then covered with soil to prevent it from being flooded with light. Blanching serves to make the taste of the cardoon delicate and pleasant and the texture more tender; if you buy greener cardoons, their flavor will be more sour and their texture fibrous.
