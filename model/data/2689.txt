So here's the thing, this dish is what happens when you mix a bit of Switzerland with a Mediterranean twist. Seriously good stuff. The salmon fillet recipe paired with classic potato rösti creates a meal that feels both special and comforting. Really, it’s awesome. The rösti is that crispy Swiss-style potato pancake from traditional European cuisine, perfectly complementing the soft, rich salmon. And the sauce? Add a velvety fresh pea sauce—crafted with Greek yogurt, mint, lime, and sweet peas—and you’ve got a plate full of fresh flavors and exciting textures.
For real, it’s perfect for when you want something that looks fancy but still tastes really good and simple. The lime and mint in the pea purée add a pop of brightness, keeping the dish light and refreshing. Some might call this an easy salmon dinner , but it’s got enough flair to surprise anyone.
Bite into the tender salmon for a buttery flavor. Pretty much. Enjoy the golden crunch of the rösti, and savor the creamy, tangy pea sauce that ties it all together. The Greek yogurt and lime highlight Mediterranean influences, making the sauce lighter than typical mashed peas—no question.
This isn’t just a meal; it’s a step up from regular weeknight fish recipes. Fans of healthy fish recipes or those seeking new sides for fish will really really love this. And look, the whole plate is colorful, fresh, and perfectly moist. It’s a smart choice for anyone wanting to serve something rooted in traditional European food with a modern, upbeat vibe. Whether you’re hosting a dinner or just want to treat yourself, this dish brings something really special without being complicated. It’s all about balancing flavors and textures, offering a delicious experience that’s both simple and elegant. Can't go wrong.
To prepare the salmon fillet with rösti and pea cream, start by marinating the fish: in a bowl, pour the oil, mixed peppercorns , chopped thyme , a pinch of salt, and mix everything together .
Remove the skin from the salmon fillets and the bones with the help of kitchen tweezers . Then place the fillets to marinate with the marinade you have prepared , letting them rest for a couple of hours in the fridge to allow the spices to release their flavor.
Then cook the potatoes in plenty of salted water to taste : you need to cook them al dente, about 20-25 minutes will suffice to keep them firm. Then shell the fresh peas and pour them into a pan with a drizzle of oil . Sauté them for a few moments, adding a pinch of salt, pepper, and a little water.
Let the peas cook with the lid on until they are tender. Then turn off the heat and let them cool. Then pour them into a blender or into a tall container to blend them with an immersion blender, along with thyme, mint leaves, and grated lime zest .
Blend to combine the ingredients, then add the Greek yogurt . Blend again and set the cream aside . Then let the potatoes cool, peel them, and grate them with a large-holed grater .
Clean and finely chop the onion and let it soften over very low heat in a pan with half the amount of oil . Once softened, transfer it to a small bowl and mix it with the grated potatoes; salt and pepper to taste ,
then form the rösti: line a tray with parchment paper and make 4 discs, dividing the mixture using a 3¾-inch diameter pastry ring . In a large pan, heat the remaining amount of oil over high heat and cook the rösti for a few minutes until golden on both sides (20-21).
Simultaneously, sear the salmon in another pan : 3-4 minutes will suffice, turning it from one side to the other to keep the flesh tender and juicy. Then place the salmon fillet on the pea cream and accompany it with the rösti .
Store the pea cream for 1-2 days in the refrigerator covered with cling film. The rösti can be stored for 1 day in the refrigerator, covered, and reheated in the oven as needed. It is advisable to consume the salmon immediately, and freezing the dish is not recommended.
You can vary the marinade aromas if you prefer by adding mint instead of thyme and lemon zest to give the dish a citrus note!
