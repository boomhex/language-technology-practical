Jambalaya—what a dish! It brings people together with a big pot of tender rice, spicy sausage, juicy chicken, and plenty of moist veggies. Really good stuff. The heart of this jambalaya recipe lies in its connection to New Orleans. Seriously, where else do African, Caribbean, French and Spanish flavors mix so well? Unlike the Cajun style from further south, the classic New Orleans version—often called jambalaya rossa —gets that deep red color from ripe tomatoes. And here's the thing, this sets Creole jambalaya apart. It's like Spanish paella but with that special Louisiana kick. Every bite has a little heat, some smokiness, and lots of juicy meat and seafood that soaks up all those tangy spices. Pretty simple. It’s a one-pot meal that feels like a celebration, with layers of flavor that just keep building. So good.
In New Orleans, making a pot of authentic jambalaya is about more than just the food. It's the spirit, you know? You’ll find everything from spicy andouille sausage to shrimp, chicken and maybe even a little ham. A little bit of this and that, right? Restaurants and home cooks alike have their own takes, adding a bit of their family’s background. The way tomatoes are cooked down until they’re sweet and rich is a nod to their unique heritage. To be honest, no matter what, the rice ends up fluffy and just the right amount of crispy around the edges. Folks serve it up at parties, family gatherings, or just when they crave something that tastes like New Orleans. Also, a big pot of easy jambalaya sums up the best of Louisiana cuisine. It is fun, full of history, and really brings people back for seconds. Whether you love the smoky flavor or the moist texture, this dish is about sharing good times and even better food. It's a reminder—no question—of the colorful culture and rich culinary traditions that make this region so special. For sure.
To make jambalaya, first prepare the chicken broth: peel and coarsely chop the onion, celery, and carrots , then remove the skin from the chicken drumsticks with the help of a knife . Place both the vegetables and the chicken in a large pot ,
add the coarse salt and the allspice berries , then cover everything with water .
Cook the broth for 50 minutes from the moment the water comes to a boil . After this time, strain the broth and keep it warm, then shred the chicken separating the meat from the bones and tendons .
Now you can start preparing the jambalaya: peel and dice the green peppers , the onion , and the celery .
Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the vegetables , and sauté over medium heat for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, dice the chorizo as well . After 10 minutes, add the chorizo to the sauté ,
the chicken meat , and the Cajun spice mix . Mix well and cook over medium heat for another 10 minutes.
At this point, add the rice and toast it for a minute, then pour in the chicken broth to generously cover everything . Add the tomato sauce as well ,
cover with a lid , and cook for about 18 minutes or for the time indicated on the rice package, occasionally checking that the liquid has not dried out too much. After 10 minutes, add the whole shrimp , close the lid again , and continue cooking. Once the rice cooking time is up, the jambalaya should still be slightly brothy at the bottom.
Turn off the heat, add a grind of black pepper and some chopped fresh parsley , and your jambalaya is ready to be enjoyed !
The jambalaya can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
There is no single jambalaya, but many different recipes that change according to the available ingredients... feel free to use chicken breast instead of drumsticks or replace the shellfish with other seafood or mollusks like cuttlefish or squid. Chorizo is a particular type of sausage with a strong and spicy flavor: if you can't find it, you can choose to use smoked sausage, pancetta, or salami paste. The chicken broth can be replaced with beef broth, which will, however, give the preparation a stronger flavor. As for the spices, you can find Cajun spice mix on the market or replace it with smoked paprika, while instead of allspice, you can use common black peppercorns. We preferred to add the shrimp with the head and shell to obtain a more intense sea flavor, but if you prefer, you can shell them and cook them for less time.
