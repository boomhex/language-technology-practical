To prepare fusilli with chicken livers, start by preparing the Chicken broth which will be used for cooking the meat. Then move on to the livers: place them in a colander and rinse them under running water . Then transfer them to a tray lined with a dry cloth and pat them dry . Next, place the livers on a cutting board and chop them coarsely .
Leave the meat aside for a moment and prepare the sauté: peel and finely slice the onion , peel the garlic clove and cut it in half to remove the green sprout inside. Then in a large pan, pour a drizzle of oil, add the garlic and let it brown.
Remove the garlic when it is well browned and add the onions . Cook them for about 10 minutes, adding a ladle of chicken broth to aid cooking and prevent the onion from burning. When the onion has softened, add the chopped livers .
Salt to taste, stir , and deglaze with the brandy : cook the livers for a few minutes over high heat, 4-5 minutes will suffice to brown and flavor the meat. Then bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta and add the fusilli .
When they are al dente, drain them and pour them into the pan with the chicken livers , toss the pasta for a few minutes, stirring with a skimmer , and turn off the heat. If necessary, you can add a bit of chicken broth. The fusilli with chicken livers are ready to be enjoyed !
Fusilli with chicken livers are best enjoyed hot. You can store them in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 1 day. Freezing is not recommended.
It's all a matter of taste here: if you love delicate flavors, choose pinkish-yellow livers from the butcher; if you love flavored dishes, add bay leaves or nutmeg; if you think brandy is too strong, use white wine instead.
