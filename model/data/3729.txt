Do the same with the anchovies . Gently rinse the capers under running water, then finely chop them as well . At this point, you can combine all the ingredients: add the chopped olives, capers to a bowl,
the anchovies, and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil . Then mix everything well . The tapenade is ready, now it's time to enjoy it !
You can store the tapenade as if it were pesto, so cover the surface with plenty of oil and keep it in the refrigerator in a glass jar for about ten days.
If you prefer a stronger aroma, add minced garlic, or if you prefer a bit of freshness, grated lemon zest or chopped parsley.
Tapenade is a typical recipe from Provence, a land that over the years has transformed its gastronomic culture by shaping it according to the typical Mediterranean flavors of the Beautiful Country, just think of recipes like chickpea flatbread, which in both Piedmont and Provence is called socca, or ratatouille. However, tapenade is closely linked to the territoriality and parochial tradition of the region, encapsulating the typical ingredients. The name derives from the Provençal word tapenas, which means capers, and it is precisely for this reason that tapenade, although it may be relatable, should not be confused with black olive pâté.
