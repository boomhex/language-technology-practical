First, wash and clean the onion, celery stalk, and carrot , prepare a mix and set it aside. Remove excess fat and any gall sacs from the livers and chop them coarsely . In a saucepan, melt the butter together with the sage leaves .
Add the livers to the butter and brown for 5-6 minutes; after the livers are well browned, add half a glass of wine and let it evaporate (4-5). Meanwhile, in another saucepan, sauté the prepared onion, carrot, and celery mix with the oil .
Brown in this case as well, then add the rice . Toast the rice and let it cook, occasionally sprinkling it with a ladle of chicken broth . Meanwhile, the livers will have cooked, so turn off the heat and remove the sage leaves .
When the rice is halfway through cooking, add the livers and let everything cook together, always sprinkling with the broth and stirring to mix everything well . Once cooked, stir the liver risotto with Grana Padano, a knob of butter, let it rest for a few minutes, and serve at the table.
