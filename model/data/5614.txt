Looking for a classic and tasty dish that's quick to prepare and loved by both kids and adults? Try our Tomato Risotto! This simple yet delicious recipe combines the sweet flavors of cherry tomatoes with the fresh aroma of chopped basil, creating a delightful culinary experience.
To prepare tomato risotto, start by sautéing a finely chopped onion in 3 tablespoons of oil over low heat for about 10 minutes ; the onion should not burn but become translucent. After this time, pour the rice and toast it for a couple of minutes . Then deglaze with a ladle of vegetable broth and let it evaporate .
Add the peeled cherry tomatoes to which you have added a teaspoon of sugar to remove the acidity , mix well and incorporate a ladle of broth . Add two tablespoons of tomato purée if desired. Keep incorporating a ladle of broth each time the risotto dries out, until the end of cooking. When cooking is almost finished, add chopped basil , to taste and adjust the salt if necessary.
Then take the saucepan off the heat and cream with the butter , finally add the grated Grana Padano and stir. Serve the tomato risotto hot and garnished with a few basil leaves .
For tomato risotto, you can replace the peeled cherry tomatoes with 7 oz of fresh cherry tomatoes plus 7 fluid ounces of tomato purée, or use only the purée, in this case, the dose would be 14 fluid ounces of purée. You can choose to flavor the tomato risotto by adding pepper or chili pepper according to your taste.
