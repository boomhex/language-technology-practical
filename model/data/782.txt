Zongzi are, no doubt, a big deal during the Dragon Boat Festival. These Chinese rice dumplings have such a special place in Chinese culture. And look, instead of your regular rice, you get this sticky glutinous kind. It’s really something else. It turns all soft and moist after cooking. Wrapped in big bamboo leaves, they get this light earthy taste that’s just unbeatable. During the festival, you usually find zongzi packed with marinated pork or chicken. The tender meat with the sticky rice? So so good.
Some families in China make sweet versions too—filled with red bean paste or jujube. But the savory ones? They just hit different. And here's the thing: making these dumplings? It’s about patience. Seriously. A little practice—folding leaves, tying them just right—keeps all that moist filling inside.

They stand out, not just in how they’re made but in the meaning they carry. Making zongzi is a tradition passed down over generations. Pretty much everyone gets in on wrapping and tying during festival season. It’s fun, and you see regional twists—some add mushrooms, salted egg yolk, or chestnuts for extra rich and savory bites. And the bamboo leaves? They do more than hold things together—they add a bit of earthy aroma that makes the first bite, well, special.
So, if you’re figuring out how to make zongzi , it’s hands-on for sure. But with a little guidance, you can totally get that festival vibe at home. Whether you want the traditional recipe or just a taste of real festival food, these glutinous rice dumplings are your chance to try something comforting and deeply rooted in culture.

Fold the edges of the leaves to form a triangular shape and close by wrapping the package with several turns of kitchen twine . Continue in the same way until all ingredients are used up; with these quantities, you will get 20 pieces. For convenience, you can tie the ends of the twine of 4-5 zongzi together so they will be easier to drain.
