instructions:
To prepare the penne all'arrabbiata with champignon mushrooms, the first thing you should do is slice them . Cut the chili pepper into pieces , peel the garlic and slice it .
Finally, also chop the parsley . Heat a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil in a rather large pan, and add garlic and chili pepper. Sauté everything over moderate heat, being careful not to burn the garlic . Add the tomato puree and let the sauce cook over moderate heat.
Then, also add the previously sliced mushrooms and let the sauce cook for about 10-15 minutes, until it is thick enough . In the meantime, put a pot full of salted water on the stove, which will be used for cooking the pasta. Once ready, salt the mushroom sauce .
When the water reaches a boil, throw in the pasta and cook it until al dente. Drain it and transfer it directly into the pan. Mix well, add the chopped parsley , and mix again. Serve the penne all'arrabbiata with champignon mushrooms while still very hot .
We recommend consuming the pasta immediately. Alternatively, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day.
