instructions:
To prepare the jacket potatoes, wash the potatoes under running water, scrubbing them to remove soil residues, then dry them with a clean cloth . Then wrap them carefully in aluminum foil and place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper . Bake them in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 1 and a half hours: after the necessary time, pierce them with the tines of a fork to see if they are cooked.
While the potatoes are cooking, grate the cheddar cheese , then sauté the bacon in a pan to toast it. Once it's crispy, place it on a tray lined with paper towels .
When the potatoes are cooked, take them out of the oven, and carefully not to burn yourself, place them on a cutting board: slice them lengthwise , open them with the help of two forks , then pour 1-2 teaspoons of grated cheddar into the slit of each potato .
Then add a teaspoon of bacon . The cheese will melt with the heat and the bacon will give a savory touch to your jacket potatoes ! Serve them piping hot !
Jacket potatoes are delicious freshly made and it's best to consume them hot right after preparation! Freezing is not recommended.
You can stuff jacket potatoes as you like, with bacon, ham, or mushrooms, for example!
