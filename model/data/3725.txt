To prepare the flaxseed bread, start with the dough. Place the Kamut® flour and the dry yeast in a bowl . Then add the water at room temperature slowly and start mixing with your hands .
Then add the oil and continue kneading with your hands . Once the dough has formed, add the salt .
Mix all the ingredients together , then transfer it to a surface and continue to knead it . Once you have a uniform dough, flatten it slightly with your hands. Add the flaxseeds and spread them over the entire surface .
Start rolling the dough to incorporate all the seeds . Knead again until you get a smooth dough and shape it into a ball with your hands .
Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in a turned-off oven with the light on for one hour or until it has doubled in size . Take the dough and gently shape it into an oval with your hands , then start rolling it from the top .
Finish wrapping it to give it the classic "loaf" shape . Place it on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and let it rise for another hour or until it has doubled in size . Then bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 40 minutes, spraying a bit of water on the surface a couple of times during the first 5 minutes .
Once baked, you can store the bread for about 3 days. Alternatively, you can portion and freeze it in freezer bags.
To check if your flaxseed bread is cooked, tap the base of the bread; it should sound hollow to be considered done. Let the bread cool slightly before slicing!
