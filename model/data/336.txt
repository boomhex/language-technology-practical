instructions:
To prepare fusilloni with black cabbage cream, first clean the black cabbage. Wash and dry the leaves, then strip off the central rib and discard it. Take about three-quarters of the leaves and blanch them in salted boiling water , then drain and transfer them to a jug . Keep the cooking water aside; it will be used later to cook the pasta.
Add oil , salt , pepper, and paprika .
Blend with an immersion blender until you get a smooth cream . If necessary, you can add a ladle of the cabbage's cooking water. Place the remaining leaves on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and season with oil .
Add the paprika and bake in a preheated static oven at 374°F for 10 minutes . In the meantime, cook the pasta in the black cabbage cooking water .
Pour the black cabbage cream into a pan , then drain the fusilloni here when al dente . Add a ladle of the pasta water and finish cooking in the pan.
Plate the dish garnishing with black cabbage chips and a sprinkle of grated Parmigiano Reggiano DOP . The fusilloni with black cabbage cream are ready to be enjoyed !
It is advisable to consume the fusilloni with black cabbage cream as soon as they are ready; if necessary, you can store them in the refrigerator in a closed container for 2 days.
The black cabbage chips can be stored at room temperature for up to 1 day in an airtight container but will tend to lose their crunchiness.
For an even creamier result, you can add some spreadable cheese to the black cabbage cream, such as robiola or ricotta.
If you wish, you can enrich the dish with crispy bacon cubes!
