instructions:
To prepare the baked cheesecake with tvorog, first, melt the butter and let it cool slightly. Pour the tvorog cheese, eggs , salt , and sugar into a large bowl.
Add the sour cream and cornstarch , then grate the lemon zest .
Finally, add the melted and slightly cooled butter and blend with the immersion blender until you get a homogeneous mixture .
Pour the mixture into a loaf pan measuring 10x4.3x2.8 inches lined with parchment paper and level the surface . Insert the syrup-soaked cherries in two evenly spaced rows, pressing slightly .
Finish by drizzling the cherries with their syrup and tap the pan on the work surface to remove any air bubbles . Bake the cheesecake on the middle shelf of a static oven for 60 minutes at 356°F, placing a container with hot water on the bottom of the oven to ensure the right humidity during baking. After the cooking time, slightly open the oven door and let the cheesecake cool completely inside before removing it from the mold . Once cooled, place the baked cheesecake with tvorog in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours before serving!
The baked cheesecake with tvorog can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 days.
It can be frozen when baked, preferably in slices.
To make the baked cheesecake with tvorog even more delicious, you can glaze it with a drizzle of melted white chocolate, as we did!
If you prefer, you can replace the syrup-soaked cherries with berries or with raisins and chocolate chips, as in other delicious variants of this traditional dessert.
