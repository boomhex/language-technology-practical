To prepare the grape tartlets, start by preparing the shortcrust pastry using the quantities indicated in the ingredients above and following the procedure you can find Shortcrust pastry Also prepare the frangipane cream, again following the quantities indicated above and the procedure indicated Frangipane cream , but stop at step 3, that is, before baking the cream. Butter and flour well 6 tartlet molds with a diameter of about 3 inches each . After resting in the fridge, roll out the shortcrust pastry into a sheet about 1/8 inch thick with the help of a rolling pin , cut it into squares of about 4 inches on each side, and lay each pastry square on the tartlet molds, making sure it adheres well to the bottom and sides of the molds. Finally, remove excess pastry using a rolling pin .
Then prick the bottom of the tartlets with the tines of a fork and place a generous tablespoon of frangipane cream on each one , which you will then level with the back of the same spoon. Wash the white grapes and cut the grapes in half (if present, remove the internal seeds). Place the grape halves on the frangipane cream, forming the petals of a flower. Place a small black grape in the center of each flower . Bake the tartlets in a static oven at 350°F for about 20-25 minutes: when the frangipane cream is golden brown and firm, the grape tartlets will be ready! Let them cool, and if you like, brush the grapes with apricot jam diluted with a little hot water to make them shinier!
If you prefer, you can make the grape tartlets using custard instead of frangipane cream. In this case, proceed with blind baking of the shortcrust pastry and fill the tartlets with the custard prepared by following our recipe Pastry cream . Finally, place the grapes on top and if you like, cover with gelatin or a thin layer of apricot jam!
