instructions:
Tagliatelle mimosa hails from the stunning Emilia-Romagna region, really bringing a splash of color to the table. It’s all about the tender green pasta—thanks to a load of spinach mixed right into the dough. And listen, you get these beautiful ribbons that are a little different from the usual. But the real surprise? The tiny, bright yellow fish polpettine—think mini meatballs made from cod or hake, a bit of bread, and a good shake of saffron. That saffron gives them their sunny color and a soft, almost sweet flavor. I mean, it really really sets this tagliatelle mimosa apart from regular Italian pasta dishes .
Folks in Emilia-Romagna love making this for Festa della Donna, which is International Women’s Day. The yellow and green colors look just like mimosa flowers—a big deal in Italy for the celebration. The whole thing feels like a party on your plate. Seriously good.
A lot of the charm is how these traditional Italian recipes mix classic pasta-making with fun twists. While classic tagliatelle usually gets paired with ragù, here you get something lighter and way more unexpected. The fish polpettine are tiny, so you get a bite with every forkful. And that saffron? It gives everything a golden glow. Add some Parmigiano and a sprinkle of fresh herbs, and you’ve got a dish that’s moist and flavorful. No question, there’s a reason this mimosa pasta recipe is for special occasions—the colors pop, flavors work, and it just feels perfect for celebrating.
If you’re into pasta with saffron , or want something that stands out from the crowd of homemade tagliatelle, this is definitely a winner. It’s a cool mix of tradition and creativity. The dish looks—and tastes—pretty crispy and cheerful. For real, this one really brings out the best of Italian culinary flair. Pretty much a must-try.
To prepare the tagliatelle, follow the green pasta recipe that Green pasta with spinach with the quantities indicated in this sheet. Once you have obtained a smooth and homogeneous dough , let it rest covered for at least half an hour in a cool place. Roll out the dough and make the tagliatelle (by rolling and then cutting it by hand following the instructions Homemade pasta (sheets and shapes) or by using the appropriate machine).
In the meantime, remove any bones from the fish, cut it into pieces , and chop it with the blades of a mixer . Place it in a bowl, add the crushed garlic clove, breadcrumbs, Parmesan, egg , salt, pepper (if desired),
dissolve the saffron in a tablespoon of water and mix well. Once you have obtained a bright yellow mixture , form very small meatballs (the size of a marble).
In a pan, heat the oil and butter and sauté two garlic cloves, which you will then remove; add the meatballs, sauté them for 2 minutes, then deglaze with brandy, add the cream , adjust salt and pepper , and then turn off the heat. Cook the tagliatelle in plenty of salted water and then, once drained, add them to the pan along with the sauce . Toss everything for a couple of minutes, then plate, dividing the meatballs among the various plates. Happy International Women's Day!!!!
You can store the mimosa tagliatelle in the refrigerator for up to one day. Alternatively, you can freeze the raw tagliatelle, portioning them into nests, and then cook them directly from frozen.
