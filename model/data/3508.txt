instructions:
To prepare the lettuce velouté, clean and chop the shallot and scallions, including the tender green part. In a large pot, melt the oil and butter, then add the shallot and scallions and let them soften over low heat for 10-15 minutes without browning. Meanwhile, detach the lettuce leaves from the heads, discarding the more damaged outer leaves, and wash them thoroughly with cold water to remove any traces of soil. Cut the lettuce leaves into chiffonade (to see the video on chiffonade cutting click here ) and add them to the scallions in the pot .
Cook for a few minutes while stirring, then add 2 cups of hot vegetable broth and continue cooking for about 20 minutes over low heat, seasoning with salt and pepper. Once the time has elapsed, drain the lettuce while keeping the cooking liquid and blend the lettuce until it becomes a fine cream .
Add 1 oz of breadcrumbs to the cooking liquid , gently cook the mixture, stirring with a ladle until it thickens . Then pour it into a pot, filter it to avoid any lumps, add the lettuce cream , and mix everything together. Depending on the desired thickness, add more hot vegetable broth.
Cut the bread into triangles (sliced bread will also work) and toast it without any fat in a well-heated non-stick pan on both sides. Pour the velouté into the dishes, garnish with the bread croutons, with some yogurt or sour cream, and with chopped parsley or chives and serve.
