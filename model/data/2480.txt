To prepare enkir tartlets with potatoes and chicory, start by making the shortcrust pastry with enkir flour and wild chicory. First, cook the wild chicory in a pan with a drizzle of oil for a few minutes, stirring occasionally until it wilts but is not completely dry . Then let it cool completely.
Meanwhile, sift the enkir flour and place it in a mixer along with cold butter cut into pieces and a pinch of salt. Turn on the mixer and blend well until the mixture resembles coarse sand, it should not come together but remain crumbly .
At this point, blend the wild chicory with an immersion blender adding water slowly until you have a very fine and liquid cream .
Then pour the crumbly mixture onto a surface and add the chicory cream . Start kneading by hand until you have a smooth and compact dough . Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it firm up in the fridge for about 30 minutes.
In the meantime, start preparing the filling for the enkir tartlets. Boil the potatoes in plenty of water , peel them and mash them while still hot in a bowl . Gradually add the milk, which you have slightly warmed , and mix with a wooden spoon until you obtain a smooth mixture.
Season with salt, pepper , and fennel seeds , leaving a handful aside for the final decoration. Mix again and put everything into a piping bag with a smooth nozzle. Separately, in a pan, sauté a halved garlic clove and add the other chicories. Let them flavor well, let all the vegetable water evaporate, remove the garlic, turn off the heat, and set them aside .
After 30 minutes, you can proceed to roll out your shortcrust pastry until you get a sheet about 1/8 inch thick . From this, cut out discs with a pastry cutter with a diameter of 4 1/2 inches . Take a tartlet mold (with a diameter of 3 1/3 inches) and use the discs to line it .
Place a small piece of parchment paper on the tartlets and cover them with ceramic baking beads suitable for blind baking . Bake the tartlet shells in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 25 minutes (in a fan oven at 320°F for 15/20 minutes). After this time, remove the ceramic beads and continue baking for about ten more minutes. Once cooked, remove the tartlet shells from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack .
At this point, everything is ready! All that's left is to assemble your enkir tartlets with potatoes and wild chicory. Fill each shell with potato and fennel cream, making concentric circles to achieve an even filling . Finally, with a fork, take some chicory, as if they were spaghetti, and place them in the center of the tartlet like a nest . Finish the tartlets with a few fennel seeds and serve .
It would be best to consume the enkir tartlets with potatoes and chicory immediately. Alternatively, they can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day.
For excellent shortcrust pastry, all the ingredients must be very cold, especially the butter and water. As an alternative to ceramic spheres, you can use dried legumes that you will only employ for blind baking. This type of baking ensures that the dough does not puff up during baking, resulting in a nice smooth, flat, and uniform shell.
