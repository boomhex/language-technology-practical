instructions:
To prepare the classic citronette, squeeze the juice of one lemon and strain it through a fine-mesh sieve . Pour the juice into a large bowl .
Add the salt and begin to emulsify with a flat whisk . You can also use a hand whisk or a mixer if you prefer. When the salt is completely dissolved, add the pepper and continue mixing.
Then also add the oil . Continue to quickly emulsify the ingredients to obtain a homogeneous and slightly thick citronette. When the ingredients are well blended, the citronette is ready to be used in your preparations !
It's preferable to use the citronette freshly prepared. As it rests, the liquid and oily parts of this emulsion tend to separate.
Alternatively, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days in an airtight glass jar and emulsify again before use.
Freezing is not recommended.
Depending on the preparation in which you will use the citronette, you can add chopped parsley or rosemary to taste for a more aromatic flavor!
