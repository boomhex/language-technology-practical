instructions:
To prepare oat milk, first, rinse the oats thoroughly under running water multiple times, until the water runs clear. At this point, transfer the oat flakes into a jug and add one liter of water .
Stir , cover with plastic wrap , and let rest for at least 12 hours in a cool, dry place. If you exceed the time by a few hours, it's not an issue. After 12 hours, the flakes will be well hydrated .
Blend with an immersion mixer , then strain the mixture using a sieve, placed over a bowl .
The blended oat flakes will remain in the sieve (you can use them, as advised!), while what is in the bowl will be the oat milk . Store it in a glass bottle or enjoy it immediately .
You can store oat milk in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
You can use the leftover oat flakes to enrich plumcakes, muffins, cakes, or cookies!
In the warmer season, if a cool, dry place is not available at home, it is preferable to let the mixture rest in the refrigerator rather than at room temperature.
