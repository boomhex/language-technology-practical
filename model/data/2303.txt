To prepare baked penne with tomato and ricotta, start by preparing the sauce. Wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them into quarters, then pour the oil along with the garlic into a large saucepan , let it brown over moderate heat, and add the cherry tomatoes .
Salt and add the basil , then cover with a lid , let it cook for about 15 minutes, and once cooked, remove the garlic and turn off the heat.
Grate the salted ricotta with a large-hole grater and cook the pasta in plenty of boiling water, salted to taste . Drain it al dente
and pour it directly into the prepared sauce . Add the salted ricotta , keeping about 1.75 oz aside, which will be used to gratinate the surface. Then pour the pasta into a 10.5x7.5 inch baking dish .
Cover the pasta surface with the reserved salted ricotta and bake in a static oven preheated to 464°F with the grill mode for 3-4 minutes (if using a convection oven, set it to 428°F). Once baked serve your baked penne with tomato and salted ricotta immediately .
Store your baked penne with tomato and salted ricotta for a maximum of 1-2 days in the refrigerator, well covered.
Replace the cherry tomatoes with tomato puree and add mozzarella instead of salted ricotta for a cheesy effect!
