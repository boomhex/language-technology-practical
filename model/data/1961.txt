instructions:
To prepare the ricotta and pear cake, start by melting 5 tbsp of butter over very low heat and then let it cool. Meanwhile, pour the eggs into a stand mixer with whisk attachment , add the sugar , 1/3 of the vanilla pod seeds, and start whisking at moderate speed ; whisk for about 10 minutes.
On a sheet of parchment paper, transfer the Giffoni hazelnut flour, sift the all-purpose flour on top , and mix with a spatula to combine them . Once you have obtained a well-whipped, light, and frothy mixture of eggs and sugar ,
pour the dry ingredients in two parts , mixing with the spatula from top to bottom to combine them without deflating the mixture , then slowly add the melted butter brought to room temperature .
Mix from bottom to top to incorporate it , then put the obtained batter into a piping bag with a plain nozzle . Preheat the oven to 400°F in static mode. Butter and flour two 9-inch diameter pans, then create a layer of batter on the bottom, starting from the center with a spiral motion
and gradually spreading over the entire surface: this way, you will get two perfect bases . At this point, with the remaining batter, you can make cookies that will be used for the final decoration of the cake: place a sheet of parchment paper on a baking tray, then start forming small disks with the leftover batter, spacing them a few inches apart, so they don't stick together while baking . You will get about twenty. Sprinkle them with chopped hazelnuts .
Now you also have the cookies ready . The bases should bake in a preheated static oven at 400°F for 13 minutes; the cookies for only 6 minutes. Once ready (17-18), let them rest to cool completely.
Wash and peel the pears with a vegetable peeler (keep the peels aside for they will be used later) ; cut the pears in half , remove the core
and dice them . Place the pear cubes in a bowl; in another, pour the sugar and the starch , mix them together
before pouring the mix over the pear cubes . Then add the lemon juice and mix thoroughly .
In a large pan, pour a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and let it heat; add the pear cubes and stir. Cook for a few minutes, then add a little water and flavor with the seeds of 1/3 vanilla pod; cook for a few more moments, stirring occasionally, and deglaze with the pear distillate . The pears should remain crunchy. Pour the cooked pears, still warm, into a bowl, recovering the juice well, and cover with plastic wrap. Let cool and meanwhile prepare the pear syrup.
Pour the water into a small saucepan along with the sugar , the vanilla pod without seeds (which you will set aside), and the pear peels .
Cook until the sugar has completely dissolved , then remove from heat and let cool. Once cold, add the pear distillate and the rum .
Mix, then you can strain , so you will have the syrup ready to soak the cake bases. In a bowl, place a whole peeled pear (leaving the stem) and cover it with sugar , rotate the bowl so the sugar is distributed over the pear. Then cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least 1 hour. Then microwave it for 4 minutes at maximum power.
Place the gelatin sheets in a bowl with cold water . Meanwhile, take the buffalo and cow's milk ricotta left to drain from the whey (even overnight if necessary), pass them through a sieve , then add the vanilla seeds you set aside earlier and 80 g of sugar .
Mix everything with electric beaters . Place the gelatin (lightly squeezed) in a bowl over a saucepan to gently dissolve it in a bain-marie (5-6).
Take a little ricotta cream and in a small bowl add it along with the now dissolved gelatin , mix and then pour everything over the remaining ricotta cream . Mix everything well. In a separate bowl, pour the fresh liquid cream (the temperature should be about 39°F) and the remaining 1 tbsp of sugar .
Whip the cream and sugar with perfectly clean electric mixer whisks . Then add the cream to the ricotta cream, first with a spatula mixing energetically , then the rest, mixing gently from top to bottom not to deflate the cream. You will obtain your smooth and velvety cream . You can put it in a disposable piping bag with a plain nozzle.
Now you can move on to assembling and decorating the ricotta and pear cake: take an acetate disk the size of 9 inches (like the diameter of the two bases). Place it on a serving platter and lay one of the disks inside . Moisten with the pear soak , then create a layer of cream by distributing it with the piping bag first with a couple of turns on the edge, the rest in the center .
Distribute the cooked pears , then another turn of ricotta cream and smooth out to even the layer . Place the other disk on top ,
soak again with the syrup and place in the freezer for at least 2 hours. When it is well set, you can prepare the decorations: in a saucepan, pour water, honey, and sugar . Stir
and let it simmer until you obtain a blonde caramel. Take a sheet of parchment paper and crumple it; when the caramel is ready , pour a small part of it on the crumpled parchment paper and let it spread to create an irregular base .
Let the remaining caramel rest for 1-2 minutes to thicken, and create a dome decoration by distributing caramel threads on a silicone sphere mold . Then pour the remaining part as a thread into a bowl with cold water and ice so that as it solidifies, it creates other decorations .
After the 2 hours, remove the ricotta and pear cake from the fridge: to more easily remove the acetate disk, you can warm the outer edge with a hairdryer , then turn the cake over and remove both the edge and the base .
Dust the cake with powdered sugar, then cut the base of the whole pear and place the pear on the cake .
Place the solidified caramel decorations, those obtained with the parchment paper, with the ice, and the domes, then lay the cookies all around the perimeter of the cake . Let it rest in the refrigerator for about 4 hours to reach the ideal consistency, after which your ricotta and pear cake is ready to be served .
You can prepare the bases and cookies beforehand and store them for 1-2 days under a glass dome or wrapped in plastic wrap. You can store the cream for 1 day in the refrigerator.
The complete cake can be stored in the fridge for up to 1-2 days.
It can be frozen without the decorations.
If you have the opportunity, use Pennate pears from Agerola, a variety with family production. These pears ripen in August-September, have a rounded shape and a very sweet taste.
