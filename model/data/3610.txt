To prepare the cream of asparagus and potatoes with croutons, peel the potatoes, wash them, and cut them into fairly small cubes. Wash the asparagus under running water (see how to clean asparagus by clicking here) to remove any traces of soil. Remove the lower part of the asparagus, which is whiter and fibrous . Separate the asparagus stems from the tips , which you will set aside.
Cut the asparagus stems into small rounds while blanching the asparagus tips in a little salted boiling water until they are al dente ; drain them and leave them in a colander to cool and lose the cooking water. Keep them for the final decoration of the soup. Peel the shallot and cut it into thin slices ,
which you will soften over moderate heat in a large saucepan with the extra virgin olive oil and butter . Then add the diced potatoes and the asparagus rounds, and sauté them for 7-8 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon , so the vegetables don't stick to the bottom.
Then deglaze with the white wine and, when it has evaporated, cover the ingredients with hot vegetable broth and cook for about 20 minutes over low heat , until the vegetables are very tender. At this point, add the cream and let it cook for another 10 minutes .
Season with freshly ground white pepper to taste and adjust the salt if necessary. Once cooked, transfer the asparagus and potato mixture to a bowl and, using an immersion blender, reduce it to a cream ; if the cream is too thick, dilute it with a little hot vegetable broth .
Meanwhile, prepare the croutons by removing the dark part from the edges of the sandwich bread slices and cutting the slices into strips and then into small squares, about 1/2 inch on each side . Heat a non-stick pan on the stove and then pour in the pieces of sandwich bread; brown them on both sides over the fire for a minute . Return the cream of asparagus and potatoes to the heat and add the chopped chives .
Add the previously blanched asparagus tips , placing some on top, and finally add the croutons , and your cream of asparagus and potatoes with croutons is ready ! Serve it directly from the pot or dish it up in small single-serving bowls!
You can store the cream of asparagus and potatoes with croutons in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, covered with plastic wrap. You can freeze the soup if you used fresh ingredients.
A rather tasty but much more caloric variant consists of browning the croutons in a little melted butter: a real treat!
