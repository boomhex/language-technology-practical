Penne with smoked salmon and snow peas totally brings those early summer vibes to life. You know, when Italy starts to warm up and everyone's dining outside—it is really special.

It's a combo that makes your plate look almost as good as it tastes. Penne rigate is the go-to pasta here, because its ridges catch all those bits of salmon and peas—super tasty. And listen, a sprinkle of chives on top? It’s fragrant and fresh, just like Italian home cooks like it.
