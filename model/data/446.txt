instructions:
To prepare the fregola with shrimp, stracciatella, and licorice, first clean the red shrimp: detach the head from the body and save the heads. Remove the shell, tail, and legs, then cut the back with the tip of a knife and remove the intestine . Place the cleaned shrimp in the refrigerator and set the heads aside .
Proceed to the cooking base: heat a splash of oil in a pan, then add the onion , celery , and carrots that you have previously coarsely chopped.
Sauté the vegetables, stirring often , then add the shrimp heads . Continue to sauté for a few minutes, crushing the heads with the ladle to release all the juices .
At this point, add the cherry tomatoes cut into halves and stir. Add the ice and cover with water .
Lower the heat and let it cook for 40 minutes . After this time, strain the broth and keep the obtained liquid warm .
Pour the fregola into a pan and toast it dry, stirring continuously . When you feel it is hot by touching it with your hands, add a ladle of broth . Continue cooking in this way, making sure to wait until the liquid is absorbed before adding more; it will take about 12 minutes.
Once the fregola is cooked, turn off the heat and stir in a drizzle of oil , then flavor with some basil leaves torn by hand . Mix well .
Let the fregola rest, and in the meantime, season the raw shrimp with oil and salt . You are ready to plate: garnish the fregola with a dollop of stracciatella , then sprinkle with licorice powder .
Finally, add the raw shrimp and a few basil leaves . Your fregola with shrimp, stracciatella, and licorice is ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the fregola with shrimp, stracciatella, and licorice immediately.
If you prefer a soupier result, you can add a little more broth to the fregola after cooking.
The licorice powder can be omitted.
