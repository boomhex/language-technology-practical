The creamy risotto gets this rich flavor from high-quality Italian sausage, delivering a savory punch that pairs perfectly with the slightly tangy notes of red wine. Watching the rice soak up the wine, turning a bright shade of red, is super satisfying.
Thing is, you gotta pick a wine you’d actually enjoy drinking, because its quality really affects both the aroma and taste. The result? A red wine risotto that's rich, flavorful, and just the right amount of moist—everything a good risotto should be.

And look, those who appreciate a well-made arborio rice recipe know that the slow, careful cooking process is key to getting that main creamy texture. Pretty much. The blend of sausage and wine makes it stand out from other risottos, like the saffron-infused Monzese or the ones with radicchio and beer.
Each bite offers a delicious mix of tender rice, juicy sausage bits, and a hint of deep, slightly sweet wine flavor. Add this dish to your list of Italian favorites, and serve it with a sprinkle of grated cheese and some crusty bread on the side.
