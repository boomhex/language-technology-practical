instructions:
To make the carrot bread bites, first trim the carrots and then peel them . Next, grate them using the smallest holes of a grater, collect the grated carrots in a bowl , and set them aside.
Dissolve the yeast in water at room temperature , then combine the flours in a large bowl , then pour in the water and mix with a fork to absorb it.
Then add the 150 g of grated carrots , the salt , and the olive oil .
Knead with your hands directly in the bowl to gather all the ingredients well , then transfer the mixture to a work surface and continue kneading until you obtain a smooth dough.
Form a ball , grease a large glass bowl with oil , place the dough in it, cover with plastic wrap , and let rise for 40 minutes in a warm place away from drafts.
After this time, take your dough, flour the work surface , place the dough on it , and roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 1-1.5 inches .
Use a dough scraper to cut vertical and then horizontal strips to obtain pieces of various shapes. Place the bites obtained on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper .
Garnish with the remaining grated carrots and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 25 minutes on the middle-lower rack. Once cooked, remove the baking sheet and let cool slightly. Your carrot bread bites are ready to enjoy !
Carrot bread bites can be stored in a paper bag for 2-3 days. You can freeze them after baking.
Fill the carrot bread bites with your choice of cold cuts and some fresh cheese for a treat!
