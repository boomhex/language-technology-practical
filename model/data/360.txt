instructions:
To prepare the fondant egg yolk raviolone with ricotta and asparagus, first make the fresh pasta. On a work surface, place the flour in a mound, put the beaten eggs in the center , and knead until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough . Wrap it in a sheet of plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
In the meantime, remove the woody part of the asparagus and cut them into pieces , leaving some tips whole for decoration .
In a pan, pour the oil, add a clove of garlic, and add the asparagus . Season with salt and pepper and cook for 15 minutes or until they become soft. Save some tips for the final decoration .
Take a portion of the asparagus and place them in a blender , add a little water , and blend until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream . Set aside.
In a bowl, put the ricotta and add the parmesan . Salt and pepper , then add the asparagus pieces .
Work with a fork and transfer everything into a piping bag .
Meanwhile, prepare the parmesan sauce: heat a bowl in a bain-marie, put the parmesan inside , pour the milk , and stir until you obtain a smooth cream .
Take the dough from the fridge and roll it out with a rolling pin or a pasta machine until you get a thin sheet about 1/16 inch thick . Use the piping bag to fill the sheet by creating rings and placing a yolk inside each one with a pinch of salt.
Brush with water and close with another sheet . Cut the pasta with the help of a 4-inch round cutter to obtain the large ravioli .
Cook for 3 minutes in boiling salted water . Meanwhile, in a pan, melt the butter with a little pasta cooking water . Drain the ravioli and sauté them in the pan for a few minutes .
Plate and garnish with the parmesan cream, asparagus sauce , place some asparagus tips and a few fresh chervil leaves on the ravioli surface . The fondant egg yolk raviolone with ricotta and asparagus is ready to be served .
It is advisable to consume the fondant egg yolk raviolone with ricotta and asparagus immediately. You can store both the parmesan cream and the asparagus sauce in the fridge, in closed containers, for a maximum of two days.
Cook the ravioli in plenty of salted water, ensuring that the water does not boil too vigorously to prevent them from breaking during cooking, which is essential to maintain the fondant center intact. Instead of chervil, you can use fresh parsley.
