To prepare the roulade with prosciutto, fontina, and grilled zucchini, prepare the Vegetable broth that you will need to cook the meat; then wash and trim the zucchini, then cut them into regular slices about 1.97 inches thick and grill them on a hot cast iron grill , on both sides. Then pound the veal to make it more tender and thin .
Lay the slices of prosciutto, grilled zucchini, and slices of fontina (you can also start with the zucchini, the important thing is that the fontina is between the two layers of ingredients), then roll the meat on itself starting from one of the shorter sides .
How to tie a roast with kitchen twine as follows: pass the twine first under and then over the meat, lengthwise, securing the ends of the thread well at the end and leaving a slightly longer piece of twine. With the longer piece of twine, proceed back along the opposite side, slip your hand into the loop and twist the rope a couple of times, then pass the meat through the obtained loop. Secure the base of the loop well by tightening the ring created around the meat and pulling the twine slightly upwards to tighten the knot. Complete the cage by repeating this operation until the entire length of the meat is tied (8-9).
Finally, secure everything with a knot at the end of the meat and tie the twine at the other end . Flavor with a sprig of rosemary . Then prepare the roulade's seasoning: roughly chop the carrot, celery, and peeled onion. In an oval pan, pour the oil, heat it, then lay the roulade and brown it, turning it from time to time for even browning.
Add the roughly chopped vegetables , then drizzle the meat with red wine and let it evaporate. After that, pour a couple of ladles of vegetable broth and cover with the lid. Cook the roulade for about 1 and a half hours on very low heat, continuing to pour vegetable broth from time to time and turning the roast for even cooking.
Once cooked, turn off the heat and remove the meat, and place it on a cutting board to cool. Pour the cooking juices and vegetables into a tall container and blend everything with an immersion blender to obtain a cream : this will be the sauce with which you can dress the meat. Slice the meat and dress it with the sauce before serving!
You can store the roulade with prosciutto, fontina, and grilled zucchini in the fridge in an airtight container for 1-2 days. It can be frozen if you used all fresh, non-thawed ingredients.
If you prefer, you can stuff the meat with other vegetables, such as mushrooms or eggplants, depending also on the season, and choose cooked ham or another type of cheese to your liking!
