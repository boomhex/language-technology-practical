instructions:
To prepare the flatbread on the text, pour the flour and baking soda into a bowl , then add the salt and water .
Add the oil as well and mix with a spoon to combine the ingredients , then transfer the mixture to the work surface and continue kneading .
When the dough is smooth and homogeneous, transfer it to the bowl , cover with plastic wrap, and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. After this time, put the appropriate pan (the text) on low heat. Take the dough and divide it into 2 portions of about 12 ounces each . Roll each portion with a rolling pin to obtain a disc approximately 10 inches in diameter .
Place a dough disc on the hot text and cook on low heat for a few minutes. When brown spots start to form on the underside , flip it over and cook for a couple more minutes . Remove the flatbread from the pan and let it cool slightly while you proceed with cooking the second one. Your flatbread on the text is ready to be cut in half and filled!
The flatbread on the text can be stored at room temperature for 2 days, in an airtight container.
If you don't have the text, you can cook this typical Pan-fried Bread .
