This isn’t your everyday ravioli—it’s a raviolone with molten yolk with a tender pasta shell. Inside, there’s a super tasty mix of ricotta and asparagus . The filling? It’s creamy ricotta, a touch of salty parmesan, and pieces of asparagus that have both a crisp bite and a mellow, almost buttery taste. At the center, there’s a soft egg yolk that stays silky and runny even after cooking. For real. The harmony of moist ricotta, colorful green asparagus, and rich yolk makes this dish a standout at Italian tables. Especially in spring—when asparagus is at its peak.
So, here’s the deal. In Northern Italy, each region has its own twist on ricotta and asparagus ravioli , but this one’s got that unique yolk inside. People love it for special occasions and dinner parties. And why? Because breaking into the pasta and letting the golden yolk spill out feels kinda fancy. Seriously good.
