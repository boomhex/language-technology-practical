Blanch the broad beans in slightly salted boiling water for one minute . Drain and let them cool, then peel them .
Slice the bread and grill it on a hot griddle . Once toasted, rub the bread with garlic .
Assemble the bruschetta by spreading the herbs on the bread, then add the broad beans and season each with a teaspoon of oil and a teaspoon of parmesan . Your bruschetta with broad beans and herbs is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the bruschetta with broad beans and herbs as soon as it is prepared. You can store the herbs and broad beans in the refrigerator, sealed in an airtight container, for 2 days, then assemble the bruschetta at the last minute. If you used fresh vegetables, you can also freeze them.
For a creamier version, you can blend half of the broad beans with a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil to obtain a velvety base to spread on the bread, before adding the whole herbs.
For a more flavorful touch, replace the Parmesan with pecorino shavings!
