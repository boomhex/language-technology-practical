instructions:
To make the ceviche, first prepare the ingredients you'll need: chop the cilantro , peel and thinly slice the red onion , and coarsely chop the pepper .
Remove the skin from the grouper and mackerel fillets , then use tweezers to remove the bones . Cut the fish fillets into smaller pieces of the same size .
Place the fillets in a baking dish, trying not to overlap them too much, then add the onion , grated lime zest , and chopped pepper .
Add the cilantro , then pour in the lime juice and the oil .
Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let it marinate in the refrigerator for about an hour. After the marinating time , serve the ceviche with lime wedges !
It is recommended to consume the ceviche immediately after marinating.
You can enrich the ceviche with avocado slices and serve it with corn and boiled sweet potatoes! If you prefer, replace the habanero pepper with fresh red pepper and the cilantro with parsley, although doing so will lose some of the original flavor.
The juice in which the fish is marinated is called leche de tigre and is highly appreciated in Peru for its supposed aphrodisiac properties!
Before consuming raw, marinated, or not perfectly cooked fish, it is recommended to freeze it for at least 96 hours at -0 °F in a home freezer marked with 3 or more stars, according to Ministry of Health guidelines .
