To prepare the puff pastry with ham, ricotta, and vegetables, start with the vegetables: wash all the vegetables, then trim the green beans , shell the peas, and peel the carrots, then cut them into strips . In a pot, heat plenty of water, and when it boils, add the green beans
then the carrots and peas , cook the vegetables for 7-8 minutes; they should remain crunchy. Then drain them and transfer them to a bowl full of ice: this will cool them immediately while keeping their brightness intact .
Set the vegetables aside and focus on the filling: finely chop the chives , then in a small bowl, add the ricotta and the grated cheese , the chopped chives
also add salt and pepper to taste, the oil , and mix everything with a fork . Place a rectangle of puff pastry on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spread the ricotta evenly, being careful to leave a couple of inches from the edge,
one of vegetables (13-14) and the slices of ham laid out to cover the other layers .
Then continue starting again with a layer of ricotta , one of vegetables , and another of cooked ham until the ingredients are used up, finishing with a layer of cooked ham.
Take the egg, separate the yolk from the white, and use the latter to brush the edges of the pastry ; then place the other rectangle of pastry on top: roll the pastry onto the rolling pin, then unroll it and seal the edges with the tines of a fork all around .
With a fluted pastry cutter, trim the excess corners to round them off and prick the surface of the puff pastry with the tines of a fork . Roll out the pastry scraps and make decorations to place on the puff pastry; we used a small round cutter to make many disks
to decorate the corners and the center of the puff pastry, then brush the entire surface with the beaten yolk . Place the puff pastry in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes: this will cool the pastry and help it hold its shape during baking. After the necessary time, bake the puff pastry in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 30 minutes (320°F for 20 minutes if fan-assisted). Once cooked, remove from the oven , let it cool slightly, then remove from the mold and serve the puff pastry with ham, ricotta, and vegetables as a tasty appetizer, perhaps served in small cubes!
Store the puff pastry with ham, ricotta, and vegetables in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 1-2 days. You can freeze it once cooked and completely cooled, if you used fresh, non-thawed ingredients.
Instead of ricotta, you could use another creamy cheese of your choice, replace the cooked ham with raw ham or salami, and for the vegetables... you just have to choose the ones you prefer among those in season!
