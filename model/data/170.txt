instructions:
To prepare the lemon sorbet without an ice cream maker, first place a steel bowl in the freezer and let it cool for at least an hour. Start with the syrup: in a saucepan, pour the water and the sugar , then add the lemon zest, being careful not to take the white part . Bring to a boil for about 5 minutes: the syrup should remain clear, without caramelizing.
At this point, add the lemon juice and let it cool. In the meantime, whip the egg white to stiff peaks in a separate bowl .
Pour the cooled syrup into the freezer-cold steel bowl, straining it through a sieve , then incorporate the whipped egg white mixing with a hand whisk .
Place the bowl back in the freezer and stir the mixture every half hour for at least 5-6 times . After this time, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it set in the freezer for another 24 hours. Your lemon sorbet without an ice cream maker is ready to be served with fresh mint leaves !
The lemon sorbet without an ice cream maker can be stored in the freezer for up to one month.
To minimize risks associated with consuming raw eggs, we recommend using pasteurized egg whites.
