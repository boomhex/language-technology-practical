instructions:
To make the orange mackerel, first, clean the fish: cut the lateral fins , slit the belly with a knife and gut it , then rinse under running water to clean it .
Now make diagonal cuts on the sides and set aside. Prepare the marinade ingredients: crush the peppercorns with the back of the spoon to release their aroma better , then squeeze the orange juice .
Peel and thinly slice the garlic . Grease a baking dish with oil, place the mackerel on top, and drizzle more oil over them , add the peppercorns ,
salt , scent with the dill sprigs , and flavor with the garlic slices .
Finally, pour half of the orange juice over the fish , cover with plastic wrap , and let marinate for 2 hours in the refrigerator. After marinating, proceed to cooking: heat a pan with a drizzle of olive oil, and when it's hot, place the fillets in .
Cook them over high heat for 4 minutes without touching them, then turn them over, pour the remaining orange juice over them , and continue cooking for another 2 minutes. Once the sauce has thickened and the mackerel are well flavored , serve them immediately, garnishing with grated orange zest on top .
Orange mackerel can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day. We do not recommend freezing after cooking.
You can also use a cast iron grill to cook the mackerel, keeping the cooking times the same. If you prefer, you can also bake them in the oven at 350°F (180°C) for 25 minutes: this type of cooking tends to dry out the flesh, so it is advisable to moisten the fish with some broth or white wine to keep it tender.
