In the meantime, prepare the garnishing ingredients: you can use strawberries, kiwi, chocolate, almonds, yogurt, honey, jam, etc... We propose this version: pour the porridge into bowls and garnish with yogurt and strawberries .

It is recommended to consume the porridge as soon as it's ready.
If you prefer a creamy porridge consistency, it's better to choose extra-fine oat flakes, like those used in this recipe. Whole oat flakes, on the other hand, give the porridge a more rustic consistency, but in this case, it's advisable to soak them overnight.
Honey can be omitted or replaced with sugar or maple syrup, depending on the desired level of sweetness.
Cow's milk can be substituted with Homemade oat milk or another plant-based milk of your choice.
You can vary the proportion between water and milk to achieve a result closer to your taste preferences!
