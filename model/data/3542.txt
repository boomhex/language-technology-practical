To prepare the plum and ginger jam, start by sanitizing the jars and lids as indicated in the Ministry of Health's guidelines at the end of the recipe. Once you have completed this step, move on to the plums: wash them and cut them in half , remove the pit , and then cut them into cubes .
Using a peeler or small knife, peel the ginger . Place a large pot on the stove and add the plums . Then add the sugar .
Grate the ginger and mix with a wooden spoon to distribute the sugar evenly . Stir occasionally, cooking over moderate heat for about 30 minutes, and allow the mixture to reach a temperature of 226°F .
Once cooked, pass the jam through a food mill, preferably with a fine mesh , then pour it hot into the sanitized jars , making sure to leave 1/2 inch from the jar rim . Tap the jars lightly on a surface to settle the plum and ginger jam. Close the jars and let them cool. If you use jars with rubber-sealed closures, you can test the vacuum seal by pulling the tab: if it makes a snapping sound, the content has been properly vacuum-sealed. Conversely, if the seal feels "soft," it means the vacuum seal wasn't created correctly and it's better not to eat the content. If using screw-top jars, after filling the hot jam, screw the lids on tightly but not too tight, and let the jars cool. You can turn them upside down or skip this step: the heat will still create a vacuum, allowing the product to be preserved for a long time. Once the jars have cooled, check if the vacuum seal is successful: press the center of the lid and if you don't hear the classic "click-clack," the vacuum seal has occurred. Once you've verified that preservation is successful, your plum and ginger jam is ready to be enjoyed!
Plum and ginger jam can be stored for about 3 months, as long as the vacuum seal is successful and the jars are stored in a cool, dry place away from light and heat sources. It's recommended to wait at least 2-3 weeks before consuming the jam. Once opened, store each jar in the refrigerator and consume within 3-4 days maximum.
Plums and ginger, a surprisingly good combination! I tried them a while ago and since then I can't do without them. Not only for breakfast and snack but also to accompany sweet cheeses and white meats, plum and ginger jam always surprises me! The slightly sour taste of plums and the spiciness of ginger are truly a winning combination!
Homemade preparation of preserves and jams can pose health risks. In a domestic setting, it is not possible to create the necessary conditions and measures to guarantee food safety and suitability, which industrial procedures can ensure to prevent dangerous contamination. It is therefore important to closely follow food safety instructions to reduce risks, but it's important to always keep in mind that the same food safety level as professionally produced preserves and jams can never be achieved. For correct preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the Ministry of Health's guidelines .
