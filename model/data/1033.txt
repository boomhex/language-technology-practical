instructions:
To prepare the puff pastry swirls with zucchini and ham, start by washing and drying the zucchini. Trim the ends and then grate them using a large-hole grater . Heat a pan with a little olive oil and add the zucchini , season with salt, pepper, and thyme, and let them cook for 5 minutes over medium heat. They should be well-dried .
Let the zucchini cool completely, then unroll the puff pastry. Cover the surface with zucchini, leaving about 1/2 inch from the edges . Continue filling the puff pastry with slices of provolone and finally the cooked ham .
Now carefully roll the filled puff pastry using the parchment paper, making sure not to roll it inside; roll it tightly . Once you have the roll , wrap it with the parchment paper
and seal the sides well . Transfer it to the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to make it easier to cut the swirls. After the time has passed, cut about 3/4 inch swirls to obtain 12 equal pieces . Arrange them on a baking sheet with parchment paper
and decorate the surface with sunflower seeds . Well, you are ready for baking : bake the puff pastry swirls with zucchini and ham in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 20-25 minutes .
Ideally, the puff pastry swirls with zucchini and cooked ham should be consumed right away to prevent them from losing their consistency, but if needed, they can be stored in the refrigerator and slightly reheated before serving.
You can also freeze them uncooked.
Feel free to replace the provolone with any melting cheese you prefer! If you like, you can also add sun-dried tomatoes inside the swirls, and the sunflower seeds can be substituted with any nuts you like.
