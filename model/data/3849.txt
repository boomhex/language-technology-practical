instructions:
To prepare the orange clam sauté, start by cleaning the clams: tap each one on a cutting board on the open side . If dark sand comes out, it means the clam is full of sand and should be discarded. Also, discard those with broken shells. Then place them in a colander set over a bowl and rinse them several times under running water : stop when no more sand is visible in the bowl. In a large pan, sauté a whole garlic clove (so you can remove it more easily) .
Then remove the garlic and add the drained clams to the pan , stir and cover with the lid ; cook over high heat until the shells open. Once ready
you can drain them with a slotted spoon , keeping the liquid that has formed in the pan; keep the clams warm and proceed by peeling the orange with a vegetable peeler to remove only the outer zest without taking away the more bitter white part. Then cut the zest into julienne strips and set aside.
Squeeze the orange juice , strain it, and add it to the clam cooking liquid . Turn on low heat, season with ground pepper
and then the orange zest ; reduce the liquid by at least ¾, which will take a few minutes. Pour the dressing over the warm clams and flavor the orange clam sauté with fresh thyme leaves .
It is recommended to consume the orange clam sauté while hot; it can be stored in the refrigerator for about 12 hours.
Fresh clams can be stored in the refrigerator in a bowl covered with cold water or wrapped in a damp cloth for about 12 hours.
Freezing is not recommended
To give this dish an intense taste, you can purchase beautiful and very fresh veraci clams, which can contain in their large shell a big fruit and all the flavorful cooking liquid.
