To prepare the colored gnocchi with yogurt sauce, start by boiling the potatoes all together (which you will then divide into two different bowls according to the indicated amounts): in a pot, cook the potatoes (preferably all of the same size) by boiling them with the skin on for 30-40 minutes . Cut the pumpkin into wedges, remove the skin, and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , bake them for about 20-25 minutes in a preheated static oven at 356°F (or 320°F in a fan oven for 15 minutes) until soft .
When the potatoes are cooked, pass them through a potato ricer and collect the pulp in two separate bowls. In one bowl, proceed with the dough for the pumpkin gnocchi, also add the pumpkin pulp passed through the potato ricer , then add the flour ,
the egg, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper, and knead the ingredients together until you obtain a homogeneous, smooth but not hard dough. On a floured surface, form long sticks , which you will cut with a dough cutter (or a knife) into pieces the size of a large hazelnut .
Once you have the pumpkin gnocchi, pass them one by one over the tines of a fork or the specific gnocchi board to give them the characteristic ridges and place them on a floured tray, spaced apart. Now, take care of the dough for the spinach gnocchi: sauté the spinach in a pan with a little olive oil to soften them
then chop them with a knife and add them to the remaining potato puree, add the flour and salt, and knead until you get a compact dough. Form the gnocchi following the same procedure: form long sticks, which you will cut into pieces the size of a large hazelnut . Once you have the spinach gnocchi, pass them one by one over the tines of a fork or the specific tool to give them the characteristic ridges and place them on a floured tray.
Put two pots with plenty of salted water on the heat and bring them to a boil, which will be used for cooking the gnocchi. Meanwhile, prepare the yogurt sauce: heat the yogurt in a pan, season it with salt, pepper , grated Grana Padano , and flavor with nutmeg .
Cook the gnocchi separately, meanwhile, pour the yogurt sauce into the serving dishes, and as soon as the gnocchi rise to the surface, drain them with a slotted spoon (19-20) and distribute them on the plates over the sauce, season with grated Grana and garnish with sage leaves. The colored gnocchi with yogurt sauce are ready, enjoy them while hot !
Once cooked, store the gnocchi in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for a maximum of a couple of days. You can prepare them in advance and freeze them by placing them in the freezer before cooking them: place them on a tray, and then, once frozen, transfer them to appropriate food bags. This way, you will prevent the gnocchi from sticking to each other.
For an even more delicious dish, you can garnish the gnocchi with crispy bacon.
