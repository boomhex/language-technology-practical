instructions:
To prepare the golden milk ice cream, pour the coconut milk into a saucepan, add the maple syrup and flavor with the vanilla seeds and pod . Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring with a spatula or a whisk .
Remove the saucepan from the heat, discard the vanilla pod, and divide the mixture into two parts, one of 150 g (5.3 oz) and one of 300 g (10.6 oz) . In the 300 g bowl, add the turmeric , and the cinnamon
and the ginger powder . Mix well with a whisk and place both bowls in the refrigerator for 5 minutes .
Take an ice pop mold with a capacity of about 2.4 oz for each stick, and fill it with the white mixture, distributing it evenly among 6 compartments , then place the mold in the freezer for about 10 minutes. After this time, take the mold and pour the spiced mixture over the white one .
At this point, cover with the lid, insert the sticks , and let it set in the freezer for at least 5 hours. When removing the ice creams, briefly run the mold under warm water to facilitate the operation and enjoy your golden milk ice cream for a rejuvenating break !
You can store the golden milk ice cream in the freezer for about 2 weeks.
You can vary the spices according to your taste and possibly add some candied ginger pieces! As an alternative to coconut milk, you can use almond or rice milk, or if you prefer, cow's milk.
