To prepare the two-chocolate salami, start by preparing the white chocolate mixture, which you will use to create the heart of the salami. Coarsely break 100 g of dry biscuits (or Pavesini) with your hands and set them aside . Then melt the dark and white chocolate separately in the microwave or a bain-marie and set them aside (2-3).
Add the warmed condensed milk with the cream to the melted white chocolate , mix well, and let it cool at room temperature. If the mixture is too thick, add a couple of tablespoons of hot cream. In another bowl, place the softened butter at room temperature and the sugar , use an electric mixer to whip it all together to get a creamy mixture .
Then add the egg yolk and continue beating until the mixture is white and fluffy , add the white chocolate along with the now-cooled condensed milk , and continue mixing.
Once you have obtained a smooth and homogeneous mixture , add it to the crumbled biscuits and mix everything well with a spoon . Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it firm up in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
Place the biscuit mixture between two sheets of parchment paper , and press it with a rolling pin to shape it into a square about 1 cm (0.39 inches) thick , and place it in the fridge to firm up and become compact. Then, using a heart-shaped cookie cutter, cut out 9 small hearts, place them in a row on a sheet of parchment paper, one next to the other , wrap the parchment paper around the hearts, and tightly close the ends like a candy, and place to firm up in the freezer for half an hour.
Meanwhile, prepare the dark chocolate mixture that will be the wrapper for the heart, coarsely break 200 g of biscuits; in another bowl, place the butter, add the sugar , and beat for a few minutes until you get a soft mixture, then add the eggs .
Beat again to incorporate them, and when you have a white and fluffy mixture , add the previously melted and now warm dark chocolate and work the mixture until you have a homogeneous consistency .
Add the chocolate mixture to the broken biscuits , mix it all , cover with plastic wrap, and let it firm up in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes. Then place the dough on a sheet of parchment paper, shaping it into a rectangle large enough to entirely cover the white part.
which you will place in the center of the dark chocolate mixture . Cover with some chocolate mixture and compact it around the heart, giving it a sausage shape. Wrap the salami first tightly in parchment paper, forming it as if wrapping a candy , and then in aluminum foil to keep it pressed; let it firm up in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours.
After this time, remove the two-chocolate salami from the aluminum foil and parchment paper (28-29), place it on a serving platter, and slice it , revealing the delicious white chocolate heart in every portion!
You can store the two-chocolate salami in the refrigerator wrapped in parchment paper and aluminum foil for 3-4 days. You can also freeze the entire salami wrapped in the double layer of parchment paper and foil, even sliced, so you can defrost only the portions you need. Remember to defrost it in the refrigerator at least one night before consuming it.
