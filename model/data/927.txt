To prepare the savory rolls with goat cheese and bacon, first unroll the puff pastry. Then, using a rolling cutter, cut strips on the longer side, 0.4 inches wide , you will get 24 of them. Take one of the strips and fix it to one end of the cannoli molds , then start wrapping the pastry around, gently tightening it , and when you have finished the pastry, gently pinch the last end. The molds we used are 0.6 inches thick and 6 inches long.
If your molds are long enough, you can make another one on the other side. Arrange them on a baking tray. Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F on the middle rack for 15 minutes . When the rolls are nicely golden, take them out of the oven and let them cool slightly. Then gently remove the rolls , making a slight rotating motion if they do not come off. Set aside and allow them to cool completely.
Heat a pan, add the bacon cubes , and let them cook for a few minutes, stirring often . When they are crispy, drain them and transfer them to a baking dish or a tray with paper towels . Set aside for a moment.
Pour the goat cheese into a bowl, a drizzle of oil , some chopped parsley, a pinch of salt , and pepper. Mix well with a whisk ,
then add the cream to soften the mixture and mix again. Add the crispy bacon cubes and mix with a spatula to incorporate them. Transfer the mixture into a piping bag
and use it to fill the puff pastry rolls . Try to fill them as much as possible . Continue in this way until you finish the ingredients and serve them!
It is recommended to consume the rolls immediately. Alternatively, they can be stored in the fridge for 2 days.
Unmold the rolls when they are still warm, but not hot. Once they are cold, it will be more difficult. Apply light pressure to avoid breaking them.
