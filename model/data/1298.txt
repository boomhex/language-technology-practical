instructions:
To prepare the lupin crackers, pour the lupin flour , the chickpea flour , and the rice flour into a large bowl .
Add the water , oil , and fine salt as well.
Start kneading with your hands to combine all the ingredients . Once you have obtained a homogeneous dough , place the dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper and roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of no more than 1/16 inch : you should form a rectangle.
Remove the top sheet of parchment paper and cut the dough into rectangles . With this dough and the indicated thickness, you will get about 20. Prick the surface with a pastry roller or the tines of a fork . Transfer the parchment paper onto a baking tray and brush the surface of the dough with water .
Finally, sprinkle with coarse salt and sesame seeds . Bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for about 20-25 minutes .
Once cooked, take the lupin crackers out of the oven and let them cool slightly before breaking them apart with your hands and enjoying them !
You can store lupin crackers in a paper bag for about 6 days. Freezing the dough is not recommended.
You can garnish the lupin crackers with seeds of your choice or with chopped nuts!
