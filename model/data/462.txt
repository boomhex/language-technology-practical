instructions:
To prepare the apricot tarte tatin, start with the shortcrust pastry. In a bowl, pour the flour and softened butter , cold water , and salt. Quickly knead the ingredients until you form a dough ball .
Wrap it in cling film and place it in the fridge for 2 hours. In a saucepan, pour the butter and sugar , mix, and heat over low heat .
Let them melt , then pour the mixture into a 22 cm diameter mold , rotate the pan to distribute it evenly. Now place the halved apricots in a spiral, with the flat side facing down .
You will need to create two layers of apricots , press them with your palm and set aside. Retrieve the shortcrust pastry .
Roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. Take a ring or a bowl slightly larger than the mold and cut out a disk of dough . Discard the scraps .
Transfer the dough disk over the pan , press the edges , and make holes in the center to release air during baking .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 30 minutes. Once baked , flip it onto a serving plate .
The surface will be caramelized . Sprinkle with powdered sugar and enjoy the apricot tarte tatin .
We recommend consuming the apricot tarte tatin right after preparation; alternatively, it can be stored for one day but will be less crispy. Freezing is not recommended.
As an alternative to candied apricots, you can use fresh apricots, being careful to extend the cooking time by 10 minutes.
