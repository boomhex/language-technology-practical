instructions:
To prepare the stuffed cabbage rolls, cut the sausage and remove the casing , then crumble it and set it aside, clean the leek and slice it , then clean the carrot and dice it .
In a pan with a drizzle of oil, sauté the leek and carrot over low heat for a few minutes, then add the sausage and ground meat .
Stir and cook for 10 minutes. Once the ragù is ready , transfer it to a bowl and add the grated cheese , salt and pepper.
Season with the stripped thyme leaves . Stir and let it cool slightly. Meanwhile, take 8 large leaves from the cabbage , being careful to use the lighter ones, then rinse them and boil them in salted water for 5 minutes .
Drain them and immerse them in a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking. Then dry them. Remove the tough end of the leaf . Fill the cabbage leaves in the middle with 2-3 generous tablespoons of filling .
Fold the two sides inward and then roll from bottom to top to form the roll , with these quantities you will get 8 rolls.
Wrap each roll with 2 slightly overlapping slices of bacon , so as to almost completely cover the little bundle. Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan .
Sear the rolls for a few minutes on all sides . Set the rolls aside for a moment and deglaze the pan with white wine .
Mix to emulsify the fats and obtain a thick cream. Serve the stuffed cabbage rolls with the cooking sauce and enjoy them hot .
The stuffed cabbage rolls can be stored in the fridge for one day.
If you do not like leek, you can replace it with spring onion or possibly shallot. The cheese will make the mixture slightly more cohesive, if you prefer you can also omit it. The leftover cabbage can be used as a side dish: try briefly pan-frying the leaves, thinly sliced, in a pan with oil, garlic, and chili pepper; you can also enrich it with a little tomato paste and/or a small anchovy.
