instructions:
To prepare the 5-minute muffins, pour the all-purpose flour and baking powder into the bowl of a mixer fitted with blades. Also add the almonds ,
the peeled hazelnuts , the brown sugar , and the half teaspoon of salt .
Finally, add the diced butter , the 3 eggs , and the grated zest of one lemon , taking only the yellow part.
Once all the ingredients are in , close the mixer and blend everything until you get a creamy, smooth, and homogeneous mixture .
Place the muffin liners in a muffin pan and use a spoon to transfer the batter inside, not exceeding 2/3 of their capacity (13-14); you should distribute about 2.3 oz of batter per liner. Bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for about 25 minutes; always do the toothpick test and once cooked, remove from oven and enjoy your 5-minute muffins!
Store the 5-minute muffins for up to 2 days under a glass dome. Alternatively, they can be frozen once cooked if all fresh ingredients were used.
Flavor the muffins with orange zest or vanilla. If you prefer, you can also add a tablespoon of liqueur, like amaretto or cointreau. Once cooked, dust them with powdered sugar.
