instructions:
Cheesecake swiss roll is what happens when you blend two classic desserts into one amazing treat. Really, really good stuff. Picture a soft chocolate sponge cake rolled up tightly, but instead of the usual filling, it has a creamy, moist center made from ricotta and cream cheese. This gives it that familiar cheesecake vibe. And look, the fun part is the swirl of white chocolate cream that wraps around it—creating a tender spiral that looks almost too good to eat.
Usually, people top it off with chocolate chips. So, you get that real bakery-style finish. Cheesecake swiss roll is perfect for parties or anytime you want to impress friends with something sweet and a bit different from the usual cake. Plus, this cream cheese roll cake doesn’t stick to just one flavor. Nope. Instead, it blends everything in a way that works really well.
The base? A chocolate cookie crust—offering a crispy bite beneath the soft sponge. The filling has a gentle vanilla flavor that’s just right. Some folks like to tweak it a bit. Maybe add lemon for a tang similar to a lemon curd swiss roll . Or, go with a pumpkin version for fall, like a pumpkin cheesecake roll . Thing is, the chocolate and cream cheese combo is what makes this rolled cake dessert shine.
It's fancy enough for special occasions, but familiar enough that you don’t have to worry about anyone not liking it. Really. With its fresh, creamy texture, it keeps everyone coming back for another slice. And, here's the thing, the way it looks on the plate—with all those layers and swirls—always gets people talking. So, whether you're hosting a gathering or just want a special treat at home, this cheesecake swiss roll is a great choice. Merges flavor and fun in every bite.
To prepare the cheesecake Swiss roll start with the cheesecake: soak the gelatin sheets in a small bowl with cold water for at least 10 minutes . Meanwhile, melt the butter in a double boiler and pour the cookies into the food processor ;
grind them finely then pour them into a small bowl and add the melted butter . Mix the mixture with a wooden spoon : this will be the base of the cheesecake.
Pour the mixture into a 9-inch cake pan lined with parchment paper and distribute it on the bottom compacting it with the back of a spoon . You can store the base in the refrigerator for at least half an hour to set. In the meantime, prepare the filling: heat 50 ml of heavy cream in a saucepan; then drain and squeeze the gelatin sheets carefully
and add them to the heated cream , stirring to dissolve the gelatin completely. While the cream cools, prepare the cheese cream: in a bowl, pour the cream cheese and ricotta . Then slit a vanilla bean and extract the seeds with the tip of a knife.
Add them to the cheeses , then add the remaining fresh liquid cream, the powdered sugar , and the cream in which you dissolved the gelatin sheets, now lukewarm. Work the cream with electric whisks .
Pour the cream over the biscuit base now set , distribute it evenly with the back of a spoon , and place the cheesecake in the refrigerator covered with aluminum foil for at least 2 hours. Once set, your cheesecake will be ready to be decorated.
To prepare the Swiss roll, start with the white chocolate cream filling: soak the gelatin sheets in a bowl with cold water for at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, pour the cream and milk into a saucepan to heat them . Chop the white chocolate coarsely
and melt it in a double boiler . When the cream and milk are hot, drain and squeeze the gelatin sheets carefully and dissolve them inside , stirring with a whisk to avoid lumps. Turn off the heat and let it cool; at this point, you can pour this liquid in which you dissolved the gelatin over the now melted white chocolate ;
stir with a wooden spoon to combine the two mixtures . Pour the cream into a wide and shallow bowl and cover it with plastic wrap in contact ; put it in the refrigerator to set for at least 2 hours. In the meantime, prepare the sponge cake: separate the egg yolks from the whites
and pour the yolks into a large bowl: beat them with the honey, then add half the sugar . Work the yolks and sugar with electric whisks until they are light and frothy. Then proceed in the same way for the egg whites: pour them into a large bowl, add a pinch of salt and the other half of the sugar
and whip them until creamy (make sure you have cleaned the whisks of any traces of yolks and sugar before working the egg whites). Pour the yolks gently over the whipped egg whites and fold the two mixtures with a spatula in upward motions to prevent them from deflating .
Sift the potato starch , flour, baking powder, and unsweetened cocoa powder into the bowl. Then mix to make the cream smooth.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper (you can lightly butter the baking sheet so that the parchment paper adheres better), spread the mixture evenly over the sheet , and bake it in a preheated static oven at 390°F for 6-7 minutes (if a fan oven at 355°F for 4-5 minutes). Once baked, take it out and cover it immediately with plastic wrap , to prevent the sponge cake from drying out on the surface as it cools. While the sponge cake cools, take the white chocolate cream and work it with whisks for a few moments to soften it. Then remove the plastic wrap from the now cooled sponge cake, cut it into two rectangles
and fill both with the cream, using a spatula or the back of a spoon. Roll up both rectangles from one of the longer sides and compact them well with your hands. Roll each roll with plastic wrap
and twist it closed like a candy . Place the two rolls to set in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Once the rolls are firm, cut them into slices about 1/4 inch thick . Take the cheesecake from the refrigerator, remove it from the mold, and garnish the entire perimeter with the roll slices .
Once finished , for decoration, take the chocolate chips and pour them into a disposable piping bag; then cut a rather small tip and let a few drops fall at a time creating a spiral pattern on the cake (29-30): your cheesecake Swiss roll is ready to be enjoyed!
You can store the cheesecake Swiss roll in the refrigerator covered with aluminum foil for up to 2-3 days. The Swiss roll can be stored for 2-3 days in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap. You can store the creams in bowls covered with plastic wrap in contact for 1-2 days. The cheesecake Swiss roll can be frozen even in portions if you have used fresh, not thawed ingredients.
If you have leftover roll slices, no worries! You can serve it alone as a delicious snack! Instead of chocolate cookies, you can use simple dry biscuits or the famous digestive cookies!
