At this point, add the chopped rosemary and chopped olives and knead with your hands to incorporate them into the mixture .
Place the obtained dough on a work surface dusted with corn flour and also flour it on the surface , then roll it out with a rolling pin to form a rectangle 1/8 inch thick. Cut out the biscuits using a cookie cutter 2 1/3 inches in diameter, reshaping the scraps and rolling them out again to form more biscuits: with these quantities, you should obtain about 22 .
Place the biscuits on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated fan oven at 356°F, placing it on the middle rack. When they are golden, remove your gluten-free savory biscuits from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving them !
The gluten-free savory biscuits can be stored at room temperature for about 3 days.
