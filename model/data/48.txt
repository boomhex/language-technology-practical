instructions:
To prepare chocolate-covered almonds, first spread the almonds on a baking tray and roast them in a preheated static oven at 320°F for about 10 minutes, ensuring they don't burn. Remove from the oven and let them cool . Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in a double boiler or microwave, stirring occasionally. Pour the roasted almonds into the melted chocolate .
Mix well to coat them evenly . Place paper cups on a tray and fill them with half a tablespoon of chocolate-covered almonds , then let them cool in the fridge or in a cool, dry place for at least 2 hours. Once the coating has hardened, your chocolate-covered almonds are ready to be enjoyed !
Chocolate-covered almonds can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days in an airtight container.
You can substitute dark chocolate with milk chocolate or white chocolate to create different flavors!
If you wish, you can flavor the chocolate with grated orange zest or a pinch of cinnamon, for example.
The term "atterrate" means "roasted, toasted" and refers to the processing of the almonds. According to other theories, it might instead refer to the dark color of the chocolate reminiscent of the earth.
