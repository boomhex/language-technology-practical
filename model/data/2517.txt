To prepare oriental steamed ravioli with vegetables and prawns, start by cleaning and cutting all the ingredients, keeping them separate. Remove the carrot ends, cut them into strips, and then dice them . Do the same with the zucchini and eggplants (2-3).
Clean the prawns completely removing the shell , and with the tip of a knife or a toothpick, remove the intestine . Chop them coarsely .
In a non-stick pan drizzled with olive oil, add the carrots and cook for 2 minutes, then add the zucchini . After another 2 minutes of cooking, add the eggplants and finally the prawns : season with salt and pepper and continue to cook for 3 minutes.
Now deglaze with the soy sauce , and when absorbed, finish with the soybean sprouts . Mix the ingredients well and let them rest with the heat off. Bring the water in a steamer with the appropriate perforated base to a boil .
Take the pasta discs out of the package , and after removing the film on which they rest, transfer them to the work surface. Moisten the edges of a disc using a kitchen brush , then fill it by placing 0.7-0.9 oz (20-25 grams) of filling in the center .
Close the disc to form the ravioli: lift two opposite edges and seal them together , then bring the remaining two open edges towards the center to obtain a ravioli with 4 free corners , finally press the corners together to form a small bundle .
Proceed this way with all the pasta discs to obtain 16 ravioli. Leaf the cabbage, wash and dry the leaves, and remove the central vein , then cut the leaves to make 16 squares slightly larger than the ravioli : they will serve as a base to avoid breaking the ravioli once cooked.
When the water in the steamer reaches boiling, arrange the leaf pieces on the steamer's perforated surface, each with a ravioli on top . Cover with the lid and let cook for about 10 minutes. The oriental steamed ravioli with vegetables and prawns are ready . Serve immediately.
The ravioli should be consumed immediately after cooking. Freezing is not recommended.
You can get creative by preparing the filling with the vegetables you prefer. If you want to add a spicy note, add fresh chopped chili inside the ravioli or prepare a spicy dipping sauce.
