instructions:
To prepare the whole wheat rustic bread at home, pour the whole wheat flour, the all-purpose flour , the extra virgin olive oil , and the instant yeast into a bowl.
Pour the warm water and mix with a wooden spoon just to absorb the liquids. Add the salt and start kneading with your fingertips until the dough is smooth .
Transfer the rustic bread dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until you get a soft and elastic dough. Cover it with its bowl and let it rest for 10 minutes. Cut the dough into two pieces of the same weight .
Roll out the dough balls with a rolling pin to obtain two sheets with a thickness of half a centimeter . Oil a rectangular baking tray measuring about 9x14 inches .
Place the first whole wheat base by rolling it around the rolling pin . Stuff the rustic bread with slices of cooked ham .
Add the stracchino cheese using two teaspoons . Cover with the second whole wheat base and seal the edges very well. Use a pasta cutter to make incisions on the surface both horizontally and vertically .
Oil the surface and add fresh rosemary . Bake the whole wheat rustic bread in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven , cut into squares, and enjoy it hot.
The whole wheat rustic bread can be stored in the refrigerator for 1 day covered with plastic wrap. You can cut it into pieces and freeze it.
You can substitute all-purpose flour with cake flour, adjusting the water dosage if necessary. You can fill it with other types of cold cuts or cheeses, or with seasonal vegetables sautéed in a pan like zucchini, peppers, pumpkin, mushrooms, or eggplants.
