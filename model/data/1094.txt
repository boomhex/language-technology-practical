instructions:
To prepare the asparagus rolls, start by cleaning them. Rinse and dry them with a clean towel , then cut off the white and woody base and use a vegetable peeler to remove the more fibrous part of the stem .
Submerge them in a pot full of boiling salted water, letting them cook for 5 minutes . When ready, drain them into a bowl of ice water and leave them for a minute: this will stop the cooking and the color won't fade .
Now unroll the phyllo dough and use only two sheets, overlap them , and by cutting with a smooth-bladed knife, you will get 16 rectangles of the same size , stack them ready for use .
Drain the asparagus and dry them well with absorbent paper or a clean towel , then place the first asparagus on the phyllo sheet and wrap it .
Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and continue with all the others . Bake them in a preheated static oven at 392°F, for about 15 minutes .
You have time to prepare the three accompanying sauces. Divide the mayonnaise into 3 small bowls . Proceed in this order. In the first bowl, add the zest of a lime and the juice of half and mix .
Repeat the process for the other two bowls, adding curry powder to one , and a pinch of chili powder to the other . You have everything, now all that's left is to group the slightly warmed asparagus rolls and accompany them with the 3 sauces !
The asparagus rolls can be stored in the refrigerator for one day, but keep in mind that the texture will change!
Freezing is not recommended.
You can decide to prepare your own Fake mayonnaise without eggs to customize and accompany your asparagus rolls! For a richer version, you can wrap the asparagus in a slice of bacon.
