instructions:
To prepare gnocchi with mushrooms and provola, wrap the Ratte potatoes in aluminum foil , place them on a baking tray , and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 40 minutes. Once cooked, remove the foil .
Press them with a potato masher , collecting the puree on a work surface. Add salt and rice starch , then season with a sprinkle of nutmeg .
Add the grated Parmesan and finally the pasteurized egg yolk . Knead with your hands until you obtain a homogeneous mixture.
Form a compact dough , once ready, the dough does not require resting time and can be worked immediately. Divide it into smaller portions , then roll it into logs .
Cut them into small pieces of about 0.3 oz . Round each piece between the palms of your hands to form spheres, dusting your hands with rice starch for ease. If desired, you can slightly groove them with a fork to give the classic gnocchi shape . Also, dust the prongs with starch to achieve a well-defined shape.
Focus on the provola sauce. Cut the provola into small cubes and pour the cream into a saucepan, reducing it slightly over very low heat until it thickens by 60%, which will take about a quarter of an hour. Add the provola to the hot cream .
Stir until completely melted . Transfer the mixture to the blender jar , blend until smooth, and then pass it through a fine-mesh sieve (chinoise) for a velvety consistency.
Now move on to the mushrooms. How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms with a damp cloth, remove the earthy part with a small knife , and cut 300 g into regular cubes . Thinly slice the remaining 50 g of porcini .
Transfer them to a bowl and season with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a pinch of salt, then add a few fresh thyme leaves , set them aside for garnishing the dish. Now, sauté the remaining cubed mushrooms in a pan: heat a drizzle of oil with garlic, rosemary, and thyme, then add the porcini cubes .
Brown them over high heat for a few minutes , they should not change color. Transfer them to a bowl and set aside. Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and add the gnocchi . Cook until they float to the surface.
While the gnocchi cooks, prepare their seasoning: in the same pan where you cooked the mushrooms, pour a little olive oil , butter, stripped thyme, and a sprinkle of pepper . Drain the gnocchi directly into the pan .
Let them season for a few moments . Now you're ready to plate: pour a ladle of provola sauce on the bottom and place the gnocchi on top . If the sauce sets, heat it in the microwave for a few seconds.
Decorate with the slices of raw porcini . Then add the sautéed mushrooms and finish with a drizzle of raw extra virgin olive oil and a grind of black pepper. Serve your gnocchi with mushrooms and provola immediately .
We recommend consuming the gnocchi with mushrooms and provola immediately.
You can freeze the raw gnocchi by placing them well-spaced on a tray. Let them firm up in the freezer for a few hours, then transfer them to practical freezer bags: this way, they won't stick together.
Ratte potatoes are a small, elongated French variety with firm flesh and a buttery, delicate taste. They contain little water and a lot of starch, qualities that make them perfect for gnocchi because they allow for a compact and dry dough. Alternatively, choose yellow potatoes which are more floury.
It is recommended to choose Parmigiano Reggiano aged between 24 and 36 months.
Besides porcini, you can use other varieties of mushrooms with intense aromatic notes.
