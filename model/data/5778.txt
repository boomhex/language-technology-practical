After the resting time, divide the dough in half and flatten one of the two portions with a rolling pin on a floured surface . Then, pass it through the widest setting of the pasta machine ; remember to wrap the unused portion of the dough in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.
Fold the outer flaps of the pastry towards the center , then flatten it again with a rolling pin , and pass it through the pasta machine several times, gradually reducing the thickness, until you reach the second-to-last setting .
Cut out 3 rectangles from the obtained sheets and dust with flour, then roll the short sides in towards the center . Slice the rolled dough into strips about 2-3 mm wide .
Lift the tagliolini with the blade of a knife , form them into nests, and place them on a tray dusted with semolina . At this point, bring a pot of water to a boil to cook the tagliolini. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet .
