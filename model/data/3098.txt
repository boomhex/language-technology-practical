Okay, so here’s a fun one: chocolate beer brownies with red beer. It's not your everyday combo. These Cubotti dolci al cioccolato e birra are like little cakes, but better—moist and aromatic in every bite. The magic? Starts with a double malt amber beer, giving off this caramel aroma and a sweet kick, all mixed with bitter cocoa powder. Really deep chocolate flavor. These cubes are perfect for buffets or a snack that really, really stands out.
Pop one in your mouth. You get a tender texture and that unique beer and chocolate mix. Way better than your usual dessert. And the red beer? It just makes the cocoa more fragrant, and sweet, but not too much.
Look, you don’t see beer-infused desserts this good often, and that’s why people are buzzing about these little cubes. Not your regular brownies, or just a chocolate cake. Bite into them, and it’s a fudgy middle, with a slight crispiness on the edges. Honestly, the dream finger food. Hang out with friends over hot tea or set up for a party—these stout brownies just fit.
The flavor from the red beer? It's different from any beer brownie recipe you’ve tried. Think of it as a twist on beer brownies with caramel from the amber brew and bold, slightly bitter cocoa. Want something special but chill? These beer chocolate desserts are perfect. They have that aromatic punch and are just really good. Whether treating yourself or sharing, you can't go wrong. Seriously good.
To prepare the chocolate and beer sweet cubes, start by sifting the flour , along with the baking powder and bitter cocoa into a bowl.
Then place the softened butter at room temperature and brown sugar in a stand mixer equipped with a whisk or use an electric mixer alternatively . Turn on the mixer and work everything until you get a creamy mixture. Add the eggs one at a time, always with the mixer in action, being careful to add the next egg only when the previous one has been completely absorbed into the mixture (5-6).
Once all the eggs have been absorbed, add the sifted powders one tablespoon at a time , until you obtain a homogeneous and creamy mixture. Pour the beer in a thin stream , always with the mixer in action. Finally, add the pine nuts and work the mixture for another couple of minutes.
Butter and line with parchment paper a rectangular baking pan measuring 12x9 inches , and pour the cake mixture inside evenly . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 1 hour and 10 minutes (320°F for 1 hour in a convection oven), then remove the cake from the oven and let it cool .
When the cake is completely cool, remove it from the pan, turn it over onto a cutting board , and cut it into strips 2 inches thick, then reduce each strip into small squares to get cubes measuring 2x2 inches . Place some pine nuts on each chocolate and beer sweet cube and serve!
You can store chocolate and beer sweet cubes in a tightly closed tin box for 2-3 days.
You can also choose to garnish the chocolate and beer sweet cubes with toasted pine nuts.
