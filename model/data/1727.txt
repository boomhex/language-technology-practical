instructions:
To prepare the pasta with radishes, first cut off the radish leaves that you will use to make the cream (you'll need about 1 oz of leaves) , rinse and dry them, and finally, place them in a blender cup . Then add the fresh cream ,
the grated Parmesan , peeled almonds , and the oil .
Then insert the mixer and blend everything . Once you have this cream, set it aside . Put a pot with salted water on the stove, it will be used for cooking the pasta. Also clean the radishes and slice them into thin rounds about 1/8 inch thick , set them aside.
Cook the tagliatelle and as soon as there are about 2 minutes left to the end of the cooking time indicated on the package, pour the cream into the pan and add a ladle of pasta water . Then flavor with hand-torn basil and let it warm over medium-low heat for a few moments.
Then drain the pasta into the pesto and mix, adding more water as needed to finish cooking the pasta . At the end of cooking, add a final drizzle of oil ,
mix and finally plate, garnishing with the radish slices and flavoring with a pinch of black pepper . Here is your pasta with radishes: all that's left is to serve it piping hot .
We recommend consuming the pasta with radishes immediately, but if you prefer, you can store it in the refrigerator for a couple of days. The same goes for the cream, keep it in the fridge covered with plenty of oil.
Instead of basil, you can use parsley. If you want to make your radish pesto pasta tastier, just add grated salted ricotta flakes to the plates!
