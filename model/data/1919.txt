instructions:
To prepare the caprese pasta, first wash the cherry tomatoes, then cut them in half and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, season them with olive oil , sugar , and salt
and fresh thyme leaves . Bake the cherry tomatoes in a preheated static oven at 428°F for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, place a pot full of salted water on the stove, which will be used for cooking the pasta, and bring it to a boil. Cut the mozzarella balls in half ; then prepare the basil sauce: put the previously cleaned basil leaves in a blender glass, pour the oil
and blend with an immersion blender to obtain a sauce that is not too thick, transfer the sauce to a small bowl , cover with plastic wrap to prevent oxidation, and place it in the refrigerator .
Cook the pasta according to the cooking times indicated on the package. Meanwhile, the cherry tomatoes will be ready, take them out of the oven and let them cool. Drain the pasta well and pour it into a bowl .
Season with a drizzle of olive oil and let it cool, then add the mozzarella balls , the fresh basil leaves
and the cherry tomatoes . Enhance with the basil sauce prepared earlier , mix, and serve your caprese pasta !
Caprese pasta can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. We do not recommend freezing it.
Caprese pasta is a fresh and simple first course, but nothing stops you from enriching it with other tempting ingredients like olives or tuna.
