To prepare the wholemeal rolls with pine nuts, first pour the yeast into the lukewarm water and add the sugar . Use a teaspoon to mix everything to dissolve the yeast and sugar. In a large bowl, put the wholemeal flour and all-purpose flour , and mix the two flours together with a spoon.
Pour the water with the dissolved yeast into the bowl and start kneading with your hands. While kneading, add the tablespoon of oil and finally the salt .
Knead further, then transfer the dough to the table and continue kneading until you have a nice elastic and homogeneous ball of dough . Place the obtained dough in a floured bowl, cover with a damp cloth and let it rise for about 2 hours; the dough should double in volume.
Once risen, take the dough , divide it into 8 pieces of about 1.8 oz each . With your hands, work each piece of dough, obtaining a long roll ,
flatten it with your fingers and place the pine nuts on top . Roll it up
to form bread spirals . Repeat the operation for all the pieces and gradually transfer them to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Cover with a cloth and let the rolls rise for another half hour.
Remove the cloth and bake the rolls in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 15 minutes. Remove the rolls from the oven when they are nicely puffed, golden, and crunchy on the outside . Let the rolls cool down and then enjoy them .
Once baked, the wholemeal rolls with pine nuts can be kept for 3 days in a food bag. The rolls can be frozen once baked and cooled. Alternatively, it is possible to freeze the shaped rolls before the second rise. Then, just let them thaw in the fridge and finish rising at room temperature.
If you prefer to use a convection oven, bake the rolls at 338°F for about 15 minutes.
It is possible to substitute pine nuts with other nuts, such as walnuts, almonds, or pistachios. For a more indulgent version of the recipe, you can add chocolate chips to the dough.
