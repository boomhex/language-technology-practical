instructions:
To prepare the cherry sorbet, first wash them well and pit them . You will need a total of 25 oz of pitted cherries, without stems . In a saucepan, pour the sugar and water .
Mix with a whisk and bring to a boil ; then let cool completely. Squeeze the lemon juice .
Transfer the cherries to a tall and narrow container, add the lemon juice , and blend with an immersion blender . Once you have a puree, strain it through a fine-mesh sieve , collecting it in a bowl.
Add the syrup, now at room temperature , and mix . Pour the mixture into the ice cream maker and turn it on .
As soon as it's well churned and creamy , transfer it to the freezer for at least 15-20 minutes. Using an ice cream scoop, transfer the sorbet into a bowl , garnish with fresh cherries, and serve .
The cherry sorbet can be stored in the freezer for up to a month.
We recommend checking the capacity of the ice cream maker before churning the sorbet. Especially with machines that are not self-refrigerating, it may be necessary to churn a smaller amount of mixture.
