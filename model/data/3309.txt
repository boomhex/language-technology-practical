instructions:
To prepare chestnut fritters, soak the raisins in cold water for about 10 minutes . Heat the oil for frying on a low flame. In the meantime, prepare the batter. In a bowl, pour in the eggs and sugar . Grate the zest of an orange .
Pour the milk gradually while stirring with a whisk, sift in the baking powder , and finally add the chestnut flour little by little while stirring often with a whisk .
Once the batter is well mixed , incorporate the drained and rehydrated raisins . Stir one last time .
Use two tablespoons to help: with one scoop up the batter and with the other try to give a round shape to the batter before dropping it into the oil heated to 340°F . Always be careful not to burn yourself. Fry a few at a time, using two tablespoons to form round fritters. Fry for 2-3 minutes, turning on both sides . Drain the fritters when they are golden .
Place them on a tray lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil . Then sprinkle the chestnut fritters with powdered sugar and serve immediately .
Consume your chestnut fritters freshly cooked or within a few hours. It is not recommended to store them after cooking.
