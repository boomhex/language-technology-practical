The combination of sweet peas and broad green beans (fagiolini piattoni) brings seasonal freshness, while a sprinkle of mint on top adds a hint of brightness that surprises with every bite.

To prepare the pea and pecorino risotto, start with the Vegetable broth . Cut the celery stalks in half , the carrots , and the tomato
and the previously cleaned onion . Put all the ingredients in a tall pot and fill it with water, salt, and let it cook for at least half an hour . Now clean and finely chop the shallots and divide into two bowls, each containing 40 grams.
Prepare the pea cream. In a pan, heat the oil and add the chopped shallot . Season with salt, add the peas and pour in a generous ladle of broth . Cook over high heat for 6-7 minutes and when the liquid has evaporated, add more broth and cook for another 5 minutes.
Once cooking is completed, turn off the heat and add the mint leaves to the not too dry mixture . Transfer to a blender glass and blend until smooth and homogeneous, adjust the salt and set aside.
At this point, wash, then trim the flat beans and cut them finely . Place them in a bowl and season with some hand-torn mint .
and season with a drizzle of oil . Mix and set aside. Now let's move on to the risotto. In a pan, pour a drizzle of oil, the remaining 40 g of shallots and heat with a pinch of salt. After about 1 minute, add the rice and start toasting it for a few minutes, stirring often.
Add the hot broth little by little , ensuring that the liquid part is always about a palm above the rice. Halfway through cooking, add the flat beans and peas .
Towards the end of cooking, add 2/3 of the pea cream and finish cooking the rice, adding broth as needed. Turn off the heat and cover with a lid, letting it rest for a couple of minutes . Stir in the remaining pea cream, the grated pecorino ,
the cold butter in pieces and the pepper , stir and add a drizzle of oil to make it shiny . Plate the pea and pecorino risotto and enjoy it hot .
We recommend consuming the pea and pecorino risotto immediately to best appreciate its texture, flavor, and even color. However, if necessary, it can be stored in the refrigerator covered for up to two days.
Instead of mint, small leaves of mint (the tenderest ones) will also work well.
Otherwise, instead of mint, you can try fennel and thus accentuate the freshness of your dish.
If the Pecorino is too salty for you, use half the amount and replace the other half with a milder cheese like Parmigiano Reggiano DOP or Grana Padano DOP.
