instructions:
To prepare the apricot and robiola glasses, start with the quick jam. After rinsing the apricots, cut them in half , remove the pit , and then chop them into coarse pieces .
Pour into a stainless steel pot along with the sugar and lemon juice . Turn on the stove and let it cook until you have obtained a soft puree, roughly 15 minutes .
The mixture should neither be too liquid nor too dry, keep in mind that it will firm up a bit as it cools down . Set aside and meanwhile, work on the robiola cream. In a bowl, sift the powdered sugar and then do the same with the robiola .
Fragrance with the grated lemon zest and mix everything, set aside . Finally, prepare the crumble. Crumble the dry biscuits by hand ,
chop almonds, walnuts, and hazelnuts with a knife along with a few rosemary needles . Pour over the biscuits and briefly toast in a non-stick pan over high heat .
At this point, the compote should be at room temperature, we can assemble the glasses. Make a layer of compote , then a bit of cheese , and then a bit more jam .
Finish the surface with the crumble and continue in this way with all the others . Here are the apricot and robiola glasses ready, enjoy at room temperature or chilled from the refrigerator .
You can store the apricot and robiola glasses in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
The apricot and robiola glasses have a perfect balance of texture and flavor but you can make some small variations. Mascarpone, ricotta, and spreadable cheese are fine but the two main factors might be missing with a different choice instead of robiola. This base is also perfect for other fruits, just wait for the right season to try!
