Straight from Northern Italy, crostatine ripiene are just delightful little desserts that add a special touch to any occasion. And listen, these treats made with buttery pasta frolla are baked into the most charming, petite baskets. Perfect for Sunday meals or gatherings, really. Once those shells turn a golden hue and get that crispy edge, they’re filled with crema pasticcera —a smooth vanilla pastry cream that’s so so rich yet light.
Then, to top it off, a dollop of amarene sciroppate brings a tangy twist. I mean, these preserved sour cherries don’t just pack a burst of flavor but also add a lovely deep red color. A tiny mint leaf on top? Fresh and fancy touch—pretty much. From Lombardy to Veneto, these dolci monoporzione are classic for family lunches, offering everyone their own little piece of sweet elegance.
And you know what? People are always impressed by these dolci fatti in casa . But, the real magic lies in the simple, traditional flavors. There's something so inviting about breaking into that tender pastry and savoring a bite with both creamy custard and juicy cherries. The combo of moist filling and crispy shell makes every bite intriguing—never too rich, just perfect.
Some families like to switch up the filling or experiment with different preserved fruits, but amarene sciroppate keep it true to the ricetta tradizionale italiana. These desserts often pop up at holiday tables, yet they’re equally enjoyable during a casual weeknight dinner when you want to offer a taste of pasticceria casalinga. Even those who usually skip dessert find joy in the way the tangy cherries balance the creamy filling.
With their neat size and flavors, crostatine ripiene are a pretty simple way to bring a touch of Northern Italian tradition to any gathering. Whether for a celebration or a simple family dinner, these little delights are sure to be a hit, evoking the heart of Italian hospitality and culinary art. Really really good.
To prepare the mini tarts filled with custard and sour cherries, start with the custard: take the vanilla bean, cut it with a knife and scrape out the seeds . Add the seeds and the vanilla pod to the milk and cream poured into a saucepan (you can also replace the cream with 3 tbsp of milk) . Turn on the low heat and when the mixture is about to boil, turn off the heat and let the vanilla infuse for at least 5 minutes. In the meantime, continue the preparation by separating the egg whites from the yolks; place the yolks in a large bowl and add the sugar. Beat the yolks and sugar with an electric mixer or a hand whisk to obtain a smooth cream.
When they are white and frothy, add the sifted cornstarch or rice starch and mix it with the rest of the mixture. Remove the vanilla pod from the heated milk and cream and add the egg mixture . Turn on the low heat again and stir continuously with a whisk to thicken the mixture .
Once the custard is ready, pour it into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap in contact. Let it cool first at room temperature then place it in the refrigerator until ready to use. Take the puff pastry discs , line each disc with 16 fluted molds measuring 4 inches in diameter at the top and 3 inches at the bottom .
Press the bottom and sides well and prick the bottom with a fork ; brush the discs with the yolk beaten with milk , then bake them in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 10 minutes (356°F for 5 minutes if using a fan oven; in this case, you can bake one to adjust for the others). Once baked, take them out and let them cool slightly, then unmold them and let them cool completely on a wire rack.
In the meantime, take the sour cherries, drain them from the preserving liquid and cut them in half , and obtain two quarters from each half . Take the custard and pour it into a piping bag with a star tip to fill each mini tart
Place the sour cherry quarters on each mini tart, trying to arrange them as petals: 8 quarters around the perimeter and 1 in the center . Once finished , you can further decorate the mini tarts filled with custard and sour cherries with mint leaves .
You can store the mini tarts separately under a glass dome for 1 day and the custard in the refrigerator in the piping bag or covered with plastic wrap in contact for 2 days.
The filled mini tarts can be stored in the refrigerator under a glass dome or well covered for 2 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
