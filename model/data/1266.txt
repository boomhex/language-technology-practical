instructions:
To make lactose-free cookies, pour the coconut butter into a small saucepan and melt it over low heat . In a bowl, pour the flour and sugar .
Add the egg and the baking powder , then gradually pour in the cooled coconut butter while stirring with a fork.
Gather all the ingredients with the fork , flavor with lemon zest , then continue kneading by hand until a compact dough forms. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and let it firm up in the fridge for an hour.
After the resting time, retrieve the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin on a slightly floured surface , it should reach a thickness of about a quarter-inch. Now cut out the cookies with a 1.75-inch cookie cutter , then make a hole in each cookie using a piping tip with a diameter of 0.5 inch .
As you shape the cookies, place them on a tray lined with parchment paper . With these quantities, including re-rolling scraps, you will get about 24 pieces. Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes. Once baked, take the lactose-free cookies out of the oven , let them cool , and then store them in a tin box until consumption.
Lactose-free cookies can be stored in a tin box for up to a week.
The raw dough can be frozen for about 1 month.
To enrich your lactose-free cookies, you can add chocolate chips to the dough (always ensuring the product is lactose-free) or garnish the surface of the cookies with shredded coconut before baking!
