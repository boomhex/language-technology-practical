To prepare the pasta with perch, bring plenty of water to a boil in a pot and, once boiling, salt it: you will use it later to cook the pasta. Meanwhile, clean and slice the red onion , then trim the fresh chili pepper and remove the seeds inside , then chop it. Peel and slice the garlic very thinly , or you can just clean it and leave it whole to remove from the sauce before adding the pasta.
Take the capers, if they are salted, they will need to be desalted under fresh running water by rinsing multiple times, otherwise chop them directly ; then move on to the cherry tomatoes: wash them, remove the green stem if present, and cut them into quarters ; take the perch fillet, remove any bones using kitchen tweezers. To remove them, feel the surface of the fillet to identify their presence, then cut the fillet into strips .
Finally into small cubes . Set the fish aside and in a pan pour the olive oil, the onions , the garlic, and the chili pepper .
Add the chopped capers and let everything fry over medium heat, stirring often. Once the onion is wilted, add the anchovy fillets, drained from their preservation oil ; then pour in a ladle of pasta cooking water to aid cooking .
After a few minutes, when the anchovies have melted, add the cherry tomatoes , let it cook for another 5 minutes, then lower the heat and add the perch; stir very gently and add the Taggiasca olives .
Add salt and pepper to taste and let it cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then turn off the heat and with the heat off, season with basil leaves . Meanwhile, cook the pasta in the pot with salted boiling water .
When it's al dente, drain it directly into the pan with the perch sauce, turning the heat to low , toss and flavor with lemon zest ; serve the pasta with perch hot !
It is recommended to consume the pasta with perch immediately; however, it can be stored in the fridge for 1 day in an airtight container.
The perch sauce alone can also be stored for 1 day in the refrigerator.
Freezing is not recommended.
Perch has very firm meat, but avoid cooking it for more than the 5 minutes indicated on low heat! Instead of cherry tomatoes, you could use tomato purée!
