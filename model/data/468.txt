Mix and add the sifted unsweetened cocoa . Then incorporate the baking powder, also sifted . Finally, gradually add the flour .
Mix well until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture . Pour into a lightly greased and floured 9-inch diameter pan and level it well by gently shaking the pan . Bake in a static oven at 350°F for 40 minutes in the middle part of the oven. Do the toothpick test to check for doneness. If it comes out dry, the cake is ready and you can take it out of the oven. Let it cool completely before removing it from the pan and garnish with powdered sugar if desired .
The water and cocoa cake keeps for up to three days at room temperature under a cake dome. You can freeze it after baking.
Once cooled, you can cut and fill the cake with your favorite creams or with apricot jam.
