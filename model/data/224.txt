instructions:
To prepare the pizza with pesto and ricotta stuffed crust, combine the flour and dry yeast in a bowl . Gradually pour in room temperature water while stirring with a spoon , until the flour has absorbed all the liquid .
Add the salt and continue to mix to incorporate it . Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface , then knead vigorously by hand for about 20 minutes .
Form a dough ball, cover it with the bowl , and let it rest for at least 5 minutes on the work surface . After this time, cut out 6 dough balls of approximately 9.88 oz each .
Shape the dough into balls: slightly flatten the dough ball , fold the dough towards the center , and round it. Place the dough balls on a tray lined with parchment paper and let them rise for about an hour at room temperature, covered with plastic wrap. Then transfer the tray to the refrigerator overnight (about 8-10 hours).
Prepare the crust filling: in a bowl, combine the buffalo ricotta and basil pesto , stir to blend . Cut the provola cheese into cubes .
After the rising time, take the dough balls and leave them at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then work on them one at a time on the floured work surface . Stretch the dough ball with your hands to create a disc about 12 inches in diameter, making sure the center is thicker than the edge. Spread the pesto ricotta cream around the edge . Fold the outer edges inward to cover the filling and form the crust along the entire circumference.
Spread the tomato sauce in the center , the provola cubes , and the yellow and red cherry tomatoes .
Season with a drizzle of oil and pepper to taste. Place the pizza stone in the oven and preheat it to the highest temperature in static mode (482°F-572°F). Bake the pizza and cook for about 6-7 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with crumbled Neapolitan taralli and fresh basil leaves. The pizza with pesto and ricotta stuffed crust is ready to be served .
We recommend enjoying the pizza with pesto and ricotta stuffed crust right away.
The pizza dough, once risen, can also be frozen, preferably already divided into portions, and stored in a freezer bag. Later, simply let your portion thaw at room temperature and continue with the recipe.
If you don't have a very powerful oven at home, you can add 2 tsp of sugar and 2 tbsps of olive oil to the dough.
