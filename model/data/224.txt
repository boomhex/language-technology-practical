Beef Wellington is best consumed immediately; if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator for 1-2 days in an airtight container. Reheat it in the oven at a low temperature, about 248°F, to keep the pastry crispy and heat the interior evenly without drying it out.
For an even more refined touch, you can add grated truffle to the mushroom mixture.
If you prefer a more rustic variant, try using shortcrust pastry.
