Before preparing the yogurt cream , place 2 glass bowls in the freezer for an hour. Put the heavy cream in the freezer as well. When the bowls are frozen, pour the cream into one of the two , add the powdered sugar and whip with an electric whisk .
You will need to get a firm mixture . Pour the yogurt into the other very cold bowl and mix with a spatula to soften it , then add the whipped cream .
Incorporate the whipped cream to the yogurt, mixing gently from bottom up . When the mixture is homogeneous, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least an hour. The yogurt cream is ready to be used for your desserts or alone!
The yogurt cream can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you wish, you can flavor yout yogurt cream with vanilla bean or grated orange zest!
