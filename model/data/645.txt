instructions:
To prepare the spaghettone with mullet ragù, first, take care of cleaning the fish: scale the mullets under running water and cut the fins with scissors, then dry them well and obtain the fillets .
Remove the liver portion and cut the bones into 2 pieces , then clean the head and rinse everything. Once you have separated the fish fillets from the head and bones , set the fillets aside and flour the rest in a bowl .
Heat the seed oil in a small pot and fry the fish scraps . When they are golden, drain and transfer to frying paper .
Prepare the other ingredients for the cooking base: peel and coarsely chop the onion , celery , and carrots , then crush the unpeeled garlic clove.
Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and mix all the vegetables in a bowl. Brown the vegetables in a pot with a drizzle of oil , season with salt and pepper, then add the fried bones and continue to brown.
When the base begins to stick, deglaze with white wine and let the alcohol evaporate completely, then add the tomato paste and stir for 5 minutes. At this point, cover with water , flavor with the wild fennel and let cook for an hour and a half, uncovered .
After the cooking time, blend the base with an immersion blender and strain it through a chinois to achieve a smooth and homogeneous consistency .
While the base is cooking, you can start on the fennel cream: cut the fennel stalks and set aside the fronds , then divide the fennel into 4 wedges, remove the harder central part and chop the rest into pieces . Peel the potato and slice it thinly .
Finally, peel the onion and also slice it thinly . Heat a drizzle of oil in a pot and brown the onion for a couple of minutes , then add the fennel .
Add the potatoes and brown everything for 5 minutes, seasoning with salt and pepper. At this point, pour in the milk and cover with water .
Let it cook for about 40 minutes . After this time, add the fennel fronds and blend with an immersion blender , then strain the resulting cream through a chinois .
Adjust the cream for salt and pepper, then add the fresh cream and egg white while mixing well with a whisk. Transfer the fennel cream into a siphon , screw it tight and charge it with gas, making sure to invert it while doing this.
Lastly, focus on the sauce: take the mullet fillets and remove the bones with tweezers , then remove the skin and cut the flesh into cubes .
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and drop in the spaghettoni . Meanwhile, add the mullet and some fennel to a pan with hot oil .
Salt and briefly brown over high heat, then add the mullet base . Cook everything for about 5 minutes .
Drain the spaghettoni very al dente and transfer them to the pan . Finish cooking the pasta in the sauce, adding a drizzle of oil , a grind of pepper, and, if necessary, a ladle of cooking water. Mix everything well .
Plate the pasta using a ring, then pour over the sauce and finish with the fennel foam . Garnish with a few sprigs of wild fennel and a grind of pepper: your spaghettone with mullet ragù is ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the spaghettone with mullet ragù immediately.
The fried fish scraps are used to give more flavor and consistency to the mullet base.
The milk is added to blanch the fennel cream, as well as to make it creamier.
When preparing a fish sauce, it is very important to finish cooking the pasta in the sauce so that it better absorbs the flavor.
