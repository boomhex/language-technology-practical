instructions:
To prepare the yogurt mini plumcakes, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over very low heat and let it cool slightly. In a bowl, pour the sugar and eggs . Turn on the electric whisks, or a stand mixer if you prefer, and whisk for a few minutes until the mixture is light and frothy . Lower the speed and add the flour a little at a time, this way you will avoid the formation of lumps. Then add the baking powder .
Next, add 2 tablespoons of previously melted butter (in the microwave or in a saucepan over low heat) and continue to mix with the whisks at low speed . When the butter is absorbed, add the milk little by little, still mixing with the whisks , and finally incorporate the yogurt one spoonful at a time .
At this point, butter the mini plumcake mold (each space measures approximately 2.3x3.5 inches), pour the mixture with the help of a ladle . Fill the spaces and melt the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter. Dip the tip of a knife (use one with a rounded tip) in the melted butter .
Make a cut in the center of your plumcakes : bake in a preheated static oven at 338°F for about 30 minutes . When the yogurt mini plumcakes are golden brown, remove them from the oven. Let them cool at room temperature and then unmold and enjoy them .
Yogurt mini plumcakes can be stored at room temperature covered for 3-4 days.
They can be frozen once cooled.
