instructions:
To prepare the Turkey sandwiches, start with the apple. After washing and drying it, remove the core and slice it thinly using a mandoline . Drizzle with lemon juice to prevent them from browning .
Set aside and move on to the tomato. Wash it, dry it, and slice it thinly with a knife . Then wash the Swiss chard, drain it , and move to the stove. In a pan, heat some oil with a sliced garlic clove and a chopped chili pepper .
When the garlic has flavored the oil, remove it with a skimmer and add the Swiss chard . Sauté for a few minutes over high heat and then turn off the heat .
Now prepare the sauce. Place 3 peeled cloves of garlic in a mortar and pound them well until they become creamy . Then in a bowl, beat the egg yolk with salt using a whisk
and two drops of lemon juice and slowly add the vegetable oil . When the mayonnaise has thickened, add the remaining lemon juice
and the garlic cream . Set aside and retrieve the turkey breast slices. Gently pound them with a meat mallet or pestle . Heat a grill well and add salt, pepper, and a drizzle of oil on the surface .
Grill the slices and let them get a nice color first on one side and then on the other: don't forget to use tongs to turn them . There's one last step before assembling the sandwiches: toasting the bread. Quickly toast the slices of bread in a pan until golden .
Now assemble the Turkey sandwiches. On one slice of bread, spread some garlic mayonnaise , then add the greens, tomatoes , and apple slices
and the turkey breast . Repeat but in reverse order, so apple slices, tomatoes , greens, and the slice of bread with mayonnaise. Enjoy your meal!
Once the turkey sandwiches are ready, it is recommended to consume them immediately.
If garlic isn't your friend, you can omit it and make your Turkey sandwich and sauce more pleasant. You can add a pinch of grated ginger to the sauce!
