instructions:
To prepare the bean cream, soak the beans in plenty of cold water for 12 hours (it would be better to soak them the night before, leaving them in water overnight) . After the soaking time, rinse the beans and drain them. Continuing with the preparation of our bean cream, clean and peel the onion and garlic, chop them, and place them in a pan with the melted butter to soften ;
add the beans , the pinch of cumin and coriander , cover with hot water and let simmer for about an hour, until the beans have softened, then season with salt and pepper.
Take 3/4 of the beans, mash them with a fork or blend them ; then mix the bean puree with the whole ones ; and place the obtained bean cream in 4 individual bowls that you have kept warm .
You can sprinkle the surface of the bean cream with fresh chopped coriander and small pieces of "queso asadero" (local cheese replaceable with our mozzarella). Instead of black beans, you can also use borlotti or pinto beans! Alternatively, you can use lard instead of butter, making your cream even denser and tastier.
