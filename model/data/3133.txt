To prepare the classic puff pastries with pears and speck, start by cutting the speck into very small cubes , then peel the pears, remove the core, cut them in half, and then into thin slices, which you should further reduce into small cubes (2-3). It’s best to cut the speck and pears to the same size so that the cooking will be even.
Place the pears in a pan and add the water and let them cook over high heat for about 10 minutes. At this point, add the speck and continue cooking.
When the pears have taken on a golden color, it will take about 20 minutes, add a few rosemary needles to taste and turn off the heat. Place a tablespoon of the pear and speck mixture on each of the 12 pastries and finish by placing a couple of rosemary needles on each classic pastry with pears and speck.
Consume the classic puff pastries with pears and speck immediately, or store them in the refrigerator for up to one day.
You can enrich your classic puff pastries with pears and speck with a handful of grated pecorino cheese! Salt only at the end to prevent the already salty speck from overpowering the sweet flavor of the pears.
