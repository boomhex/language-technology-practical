instructions:
To prepare the green apple sorbet, first wash a green apple and cut it into pieces, without removing the peel . Squeeze a lemon , then strain the obtained juice to hold back the seeds.
Then pour the apple pieces into a bowl , add the lemon juice and the sugar ,
then add the water and blend everything until you get a creamy consistency .
Once the ingredients are blended , transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and operate it for about 25 minutes . If you don't have an ice cream maker, you can proceed as follows: pour the mixture into a wide bowl and place it in the freezer for at least an hour. Then take it out, stir it with a fork and repeat the process until you get the desired consistency every half hour or so.
Once the indicated time has passed, stop the ice cream maker and transfer your sorbet into small glasses , which you can garnish with two thin slices of apple. Your green apple sorbet is ready to be enjoyed !
You can store the green apple sorbet in the freezer for up to a month.
For an excellent green apple sorbet, we recommend using Granny Smith apples, which are very juicy and perfect for this kind of preparation. If you want to add an extra note of flavor to your sorbet, you can serve it with a bit of prosecco when it is already ready to be enjoyed!
