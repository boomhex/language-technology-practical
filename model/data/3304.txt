Krumiri cookies are a beloved treat from Casale Monferrato in Piedmont, and they're really something special. These traditional Italian biscuits were first whipped up by pastry chef Domenico Rossi in the late 1800s. By 1890, the town had already started to recognize how important they were. Italian butter cookies like these connect folks to old stories and family traditions. And you know what? Their unique curved shape is said to be inspired by King Victor Emanuel II’s mustache—pretty fun, right? Makes them super easy to spot in any bakery. While the name “Krumiro” has a bit of mystery to it, some think it might be linked to a popular liquor of the time.
One thing’s clear, though: these cookies offer a crisp, golden bite. And look, the sweet aroma fills the room when you open a tin. Even if the authentic recipe's a secret in Casale Monferrato, various adaptations try to capture that tender texture and moist, rich flavor. Some bakers go for corn flour, others use wheat. Both achieve that Krumiri vibe. These Krumiri cookies are cherished in Piemonte—locals take pride in making them just right. Every little detail matters.
You’ll often see them paired with sweet wine or enjoyed as Italian tea biscuits in the afternoon. Which is great. They play such a big role in daily life here. There’s a simple honesty to these Piedmontese cookies —they don’t try hard at all. Still, the crispy exterior and melt-in-your-mouth interior make each bite special. Honestly, it’s no wonder folks keep coming back for more. Whether it’s their rich history, tasty taste, or a nostalgic piece of Piemonte’s past, these cookies really capture the heart of the region. They’re a bite-sized journey into the heart of Italian culinary tradition, for sure.
To prepare the Krumiri-type cookies, preheat the oven to 392°F, sift the all-purpose flour into a large bowl , then add the powdered sugar , the pulp from the vanilla pod, and a pinch of salt: mix all the ingredients well using a whisk .
Now separate the egg whites from the yolks and melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add the yolks and the melted butter to the mixture, then start kneading with your hands until you get a smooth and compact dough .
Form a ball, cover it with plastic wrap , and let it rest for half an hour at room temperature. After the necessary time, fill a canvas pastry bag (or a plastic syringe) with a star-shaped nozzle with the obtained dough, putting a little dough at a time and always softening it with your hands. On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, form crescent-shaped cookies, about 3 inches (7-8 cm) long . Bake everything at 392°F for 16 minutes, or until the cookies are golden; once the Krumiri-type cookies are ready, let them cool on a wire rack .
You can store the cookies in a tin box for 5-6 days.
For this preparation, it is necessary to use a canvas pastry bag or a plastic syringe, as the cookie dough is too thick: the classic "disposable" pastry bag, which is rather light, could easily break. To make your Krumiri-type cookies even tastier, you can add dark chocolate chips to the dough.
