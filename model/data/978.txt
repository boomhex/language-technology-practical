instructions:
To prepare the portobellos stuffed with eggs and cheese, we start by cleaning the mushrooms. After removing part of the stem, where there is more dirt, you need to scrape it away from the rest of the stem and the cap. Use a small brush or a slightly damp cloth. Detach the stem from the cap, then scoop the latter slightly with a spoon and chop everything with a knife. In a hot pan with a drizzle of oil and a peeled garlic clove, pour the chopped mushrooms and sauté over high heat for a couple of minutes at most, seasoning with salt and pepper. Once ready, remove the garlic and let it cool slightly. In a bowl, grate the cheese through the large holes, then add the chopped chives and mix. At this point, season the inside of the mushrooms with a drop of oil, salt, and pepper, and then fill them with the prepared stuffing. Place a sheet of parchment paper in a non-stick pan and arrange the stuffed portobellos on top with the filled side up. Crack the eggs one by one into a small bowl and slide them into the middle of each mushroom. Season with salt and pepper and cover with the lid, allowing to cook over medium-high heat for a few minutes or until the egg white has set. You have time to wash the radicchio leaves, dry them, cut into strips, and sauté over high heat for a few moments with oil and the peeled garlic. Arrange the warm salad on plates, add the walnuts broken by hand or with a knife, and the portobellos stuffed with eggs and cheese!
Once the portobellos stuffed with eggs and cheese are ready, it is recommended to consume them immediately.
Add a few bacon cubes under the eggs for an extra touch of flavor!
