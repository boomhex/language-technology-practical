instructions:
To prepare the stuffed anchovies in an air fryer, first soak the raisins for at least 10 minutes, then proceed with the How to Clean Anchovies . Remove the head, then gently press at the level of the gills and open the anchovies like a book, removing the bone and the innards. Rinse thoroughly with water to remove all impurities and set aside .
For the filling, place the raisins , parsley , and salt in a mixer.
Add the breadcrumbs , pecorino , and oil .
Blend until you obtain a coarse mixture . Fill the inside of the anchovies and close them .
Dip them first in the egg , then in the breadcrumbs , and as you do, place them on a tray .
Transfer them to the basket of the air fryer lined with parchment paper and cook at 355°F (180°C) for 15 minutes , turning them halfway through cooking. Your stuffed anchovies in an air fryer are ready to be enjoyed hot !
The stuffed anchovies in an air fryer should be consumed immediately after preparation.
For a richer filling, you can add pine nuts and grated lemon zest. If you do not have an air fryer, you can bake the anchovies in a convection oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 15-20 minutes, and you will still get a golden and crispy breading.
