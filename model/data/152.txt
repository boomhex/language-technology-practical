Baked calamari gratin is a classic Southern Italian dish that’s both light and full of bold flavor . In places like Naples and along the beautiful Mediterranean coast, people often pick this when they want something crispy yet satisfying—without the heaviness of fried squid.
What really makes baked calamari gratin stand out is how simple breadcrumbs—mixed with chopped parsley, garlic, and a hint of lemon zest—form a golden crust over the calamari au gratin . And you know what? This gives the squid a nice contrast: tender rings and tentacles beneath a topping that cracks a bit when you bite into it. Seriously good.
You'll find this dish at family gatherings or as a starter at casual seaside spots, where folks want to highlight the natural taste of squid—without too much batter or sauce. The experience? It's not just about texture. There’s a freshness in the air when you pull an oven-baked calamari out of the oven, and those herbs fill the room with their aroma. Pretty much amazing.
In Southern Italy, locals often use fresh seafood, adding different herbs or a dash of chili flakes for a little kick. Thing is, compared to fried calamari or other traditional recipes like 'calamari in umido' (a stewed version) or 'calamari ripieni' (stuffed), the baked squid gratin is simpler and lets you really really taste the squid itself.
Pair it with a bright salad or some roasted veggies, and you’ve got a meal that feels both special and laid-back. The best part? How the moist seafood works with the crunchy breadcrumb topping, making every bite a mix of soft and crispy. If you’re into Mediterranean flavors—or just want a seafood gratin that’s not weighed down by frying—this dish brings fun to dinnertime. And here's the thing, it’s perfect for those who appreciate Southern Italy’s culinary traditions while enjoying a refreshing twist on seafood. For real.

Baked gratinated calamari should be consumed immediately, but if there are leftovers, they can be stored in the refrigerator in a closed container for 1-2 days. To reheat, use the oven at 300°F for 10-15 minutes: this way, the breadcrumb coating will regain some crispiness without drying out the calamari.
If you like it spicy, you can add paprika to the breadcrumb coating. For an even crunchier texture, add chopped walnuts, pistachios, or almonds to the coating. For a fresh note, try serving the calamari with a yogurt sauce or a light mayonnaise.
