instructions:
To prepare vine leaf baskets with porcini mushrooms and Grana Padano, first clean the mushrooms: gently scrape them with a smooth-edged knife to remove any soil residue , then separate the cap from the stem and cut the latter into cubes .
In a skillet, heat the oil with a clove of garlic , then add the mushroom stems , salt, and pepper .
Cook over low heat for about 5 minutes, then turn off the heat, add the chopped parsley, mix well, pour into a bowl , and let cool. Meanwhile, grate the Grana Padano PDO .
When the stems have cooled, add 1.8 oz of grated Grana Padano PDO and mix to combine everything . Now take 4 ramekins with a 3.5-inch diameter and line the base and sides with 2 vine leaves each, forming a sort of basket .
Spoon a dollop of the stem mixture into the center and cover with a porcini cap , then season with salt , pepper, and a drizzle of oil.
Sprinkle the surface with 0.4 oz of the remaining Grana Padano PDO , then place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 15 minutes. After this time, sprinkle with the remaining grated Grana Padano PDO and continue cooking for another 3 minutes by turning on the grill at 464°F. Your vine leaf baskets with porcini mushrooms and Grana Padano are ready to be served !
It's recommended to consume the vine leaf baskets with porcini mushrooms and Grana Padano immediately.
If porcini mushrooms are no longer in season, you can choose portobello mushrooms instead! Alternatively to vine leaves, you can use savoy cabbage.
