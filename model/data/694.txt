instructions:
To prepare Mexican beans, first put the dried beans in a bowl with cold water , add a pinch of baking soda , and let them soak overnight. The next day, pour the drained beans into a pot of boiling water and, when it returns to a boil, drain them again; this way they will be more digestible.
Peel and finely chop the onion , then slice the chili pepper into rings . In the same pot where you blanched the beans, add the onion with a generous drizzle of oil and let it fry gently .
Once the onion has wilted, add the chili pepper and let it flavor. At this point add the beans and sauté them for a few minutes on high heat, then lower the heat and add the tomato sauce .
Cover the beans with water , then add the cinnamon stick and cumin .
Cook with the lid on for about 3 hours on low heat, stirring occasionally and adding a little water if necessary . Meanwhile, chop the parsley . After the cooking time, season with salt .
Let it thicken on the stove without the lid, stirring for a few more minutes until you reach the desired consistency . Finally, scent with chopped parsley and serve your Mexican beans !
Mexican beans can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
You can freeze them after cooking.
For an even more authentic flavor, replace parsley with fresh coriander!
If you want to further enhance the beans, you can add strips of smoked bacon.
Adjust the amount of chili pepper according to your taste.
