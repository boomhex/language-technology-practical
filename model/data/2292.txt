To clean and fillet the seabass, start by descaling it: place it in the sink and run cold water while using the appropriate tool or a knife blade. Placing it in the sink for this operation will prevent scales from scattering. Rub the descaling tool starting from the tail to the head of the fish. Repeat this operation several times until the seabass is completely descaled. Transfer the seabass to a cutting board to gut it: using scissors, make an incision starting from the end of the belly and following the entire stomach to the head . Remove the internal viscera .
To prevent the bitter taste of the viscera from remaining, thoroughly rinse the inside of the fish under running water . Proceed at this point with the filleting of the seabass: take a sharp knife and make a deep incision along the back, reaching the fish's backbone, following the line of the dorsal fins . To extract the first fillet, slide the knife blade horizontally along the work surface, from the seabass's fin to the head .
Now proceed by separating the fillet from the fish with a clean cut at the gills : slightly tilt the knife diagonally to make a good cut. Then proceed to the other side of the fish to obtain the second fillet: pass the knife blade from the tail to the gills , then make a cut at the gills to detach it from the backbone. Now remove the dorsal fins. You will now have obtained the two fillets. At this point, you can cut the head off the seabass by diagonally tilting the knife blade at the gills. Use a knife to lift the lateral bones on the fish's belly .
Remove them completely from the flesh of the seabass and use kitchen tweezers to remove any remaining bones from the fillets . Finally, if your preparation requires, you can remove the fish's skin: slide a very thin knife between the skin and the flesh of the fish to separate the two parts . Perform this operation very delicately to keep the fillet intact. Your seabass fillets are ready to be used in your preparations!
It is possible to store seabass fillets in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.
If you wish, you can freeze the seabass fillets by proceeding as follows: lay them on a piece of parchment paper and place them in the freezer for about 1 hour. Then, put them in a freezer bag for actual freezing.
