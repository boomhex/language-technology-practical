instructions:
To prepare the coconut and Nutella cheesecake, start by buttering and lining an 18 cm (7-inch) springform pan with parchment paper. Then prepare the base: melt the butter over very low heat, then blend the cookies in a food processor , transfer the powder to a bowl and add the shredded coconut .
Give a quick stir before adding the previously melted butter, which has been allowed to cool slightly . Now make the mixture uniform .
Transfer the mixture into the pan and press it down with the back of a spoon . Let it set in the fridge for at least 30 minutes . Move on to the cream: soak the gelatin in cold water for about ten minutes .
Pour the coconut yogurt into a bowl , add the cream cheese and the powdered sugar .
Mix to incorporate all the ingredients . At this point, drain the gelatin and put it in a saucepan with the coconut milk , let it dissolve over low heat, stirring continuously. Pour it over the cream .
Stir well and whip the cream to stiff peaks . Then add it to the cream .
Be careful to gently fold it in with delicate movements from bottom to top . Transfer everything onto the cookie base and level the surface .
Place the cake in the fridge to set for at least 2 hours (better 3 or 4 hours to ensure it is well set) . After this time, retrieve the cake from the fridge, pour Nutella into a bowl and work it with a spoon to soften it. Then spread it over the surface of the cake and distribute it evenly with the back of a spoon .
Gently place three strips of parchment paper, slightly spaced apart, on one of the edges of the cake , sprinkle the shredded coconut , and your coconut and Nutella cheesecake is ready .
You can store your coconut and Nutella cheesecake in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
If needed, you can also freeze it but without the topping.
If the Nutella is too solid, warm it slightly in a bain-marie, making sure it doesn't become too runny; otherwise, it will drip, and you won't be able to achieve a perfect topping layer.
In the filling, you can add some chocolate flakes to enhance everything.
