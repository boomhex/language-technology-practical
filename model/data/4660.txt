The vegan braid is a soft and fragrant dessert perfect for those who love leavened doughs rich in flavor. Its braided shape is not only scenic but also allows for even cooking, ensuring a soft texture inside and a golden, fragrant crust outside. The soy milk contributes to a velvety texture, while the vegetable margarine ensures the right softness. The addition of dark chocolate chips provides the right touch of indulgence. This dessert is ideal for breakfast or a snack, perhaps accompanied by a cup of tea or coffee. Preparing the vegan braid requires a bit of patience, but the result rewards every wait. The result is a soft, fragrant, and completely plant-based dessert that shows how vegan baking can be as delicious as traditional ones.

To prepare the vegan braid, first make the starter dough. In the stand mixer, place the flour, add the sugar , yeast , and soy milk . Knead with the hook until a smooth dough is obtained.
Place it in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let it rise until doubled, it will take about 1 hour. Take the starter dough and put it back in the stand mixer , then add the flour .
Add the sugar , soy milk , and vanilla extract. Knead until the dough comes together. Gradually add the margarine , ensuring it is fully absorbed before adding more.
Add the salt and knead again until combined. Move to the work surface, fold the dough a few times, and then form a ball . Transfer it to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rise until doubled, about 2 hours.
Take the dough and place it on a lightly floured work surface, stretching it with your hands into a rectangle . Fold the two short sides towards the center , then fold in half to match the new short sides . Roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 0.2 inches.
Distribute the dark chocolate chips and chocolate shavings in the center . Roll starting from the long side . Cut the roll in half, leaving only one end intact .
Braid the two dough strands . Join the ends to form a circle and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Let it rise for 1 hour in the turned-off oven with the light on.
Brush the surface with soy milk and bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for 25 minutes, on the lower rack. Remove from the oven and brush again with soy milk . Your vegan braid is ready to be enjoyed .
The vegan braid stays soft in a food bag or wrapped in a clean cloth for 2-3 days. If you want to keep it longer, you can freeze it in slices. When needed, just let them thaw at room temperature or warm them slightly in the oven.
Use block vegetable margarine to prevent it from becoming too soft. When forming the braid, try to gently stretch the strands and keep them well tight to get a compact braid. At the same time, when joining the ends, try to widen it a bit, so the central hole is wide enough; otherwise, it will disappear during rising. For a shiny and even sweeter effect, brush the surface after baking with maple syrup or apricot jam. For a spicier version, you can add cinnamon, nutmeg, or cardamom to the dough.
