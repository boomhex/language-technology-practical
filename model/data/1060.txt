instructions:
To prepare lentil hummus, check if the lentils you are using need soaking or not. If so, you can soak them in cold water for about 7-8 hours . After the time has passed, rinse them very well and pour them into a pot. Cover them abundantly with water

and let them cook for about 45 minutes . Once they are ready, drain them and place them inside the blender. Add the garlic clove, salt, parsley , tahini ,
paprika , lemon juice , olive oil .
Blend everything for a minute until you get a smooth cream . Plate the lentil hummus and add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of paprika .
Lentil hummus keeps in the refrigerator, sealed in a resealable container, for 2-3 days.
For a quicker version, you can use 17.5 oz of pre-cooked lentils.
Lentil hummus is good even when freshly made but is even better when cold: try it!
