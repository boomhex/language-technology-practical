instructions:
To prepare the veggie chili, begin by soaking the red beans, as they need to rehydrate in water before they are boiled. Next, let's prepare the sauce. Use a sharp knife to butterfly the chili peppers, remove the seeds, and then transfer them to a container. Cover them with hot water and allow them to rehydrate for a couple of hours. Afterward, discard half of the water and blend the remainder. Pass the resulting liquid through a sieve to discard the residues. Pour the chili sauce into a jar, cover it with oil, seal it tightly, and store it in the fridge. Now, you can prepare the chili. Peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes, and chop the peeled onion. In a clay or cast iron pot, sauté the chopped red onion with a good drizzle of oil, then add a teaspoon of chili sauce, the previously cooked beans, the diced potatoes, and the tomato puree. Cover with water and let it simmer gently for about 1 and a half hours. At this point, clean the peppers from the stem, seeds, and membranes, cut them into strips, and add them to the rest. Scent with paprika and cinnamon, adjust the salt, put the lid on, and continue cooking over low heat for half an hour, adding a bit more water if needed. At the end of cooking, sprinkle with parsley leaves, green and red chili slices, and a splash of lime. Serve your veggie chili hot with nachos or white rice.
The veggie chili can be stored in the fridge for a few days.
In the original versions of chili, beans seem to be absent, but we wanted to add them, especially to compensate for the lack of animal proteins by replacing them with plant-based proteins. Since the dish embodies the concept of hospitality, as everyone can boast their version, we recommend adding some diced pumpkin to make it an even more flavorful dish.
