instructions:
Pizza dolce con confettura di fragole is like a fun twist on the classics from Campania, Italy, where—let’s be honest—pizza isn’t just about cheese and tomatoes. This one's a strawberry jam dessert pizza that takes all the best parts of a traditional pizza and turns them into something sweet and colorful. Seriously good. The base? It's pan brioche dough rolled out thin, just like a pizza, so it’s soft but still has that light, tender bite. Instead of tomato sauce, there's sweet strawberry jam bringing a fruity pop and that sticky, jammy goodness. And look, it’s not just about the jam. There's this vanilla milk cream spread on top that looks like mozzarella and tastes like the best part of a pastry—pretty much. Then, the whole thing gets finished with fresh fruit, which folks in Campania love mixing up depending on what's in season or just what they have around. This dessert pizza recipe feels both playful and a bit fancy—seriously, a conversation starter at any get-together.
You might be surprised by how easy it is to have fun with a sweet pizza with strawberry jam . It's a fantastic way to show off some creativity in the kitchen. And look, you can swap in peaches, berries, or even crispy apple slices if you’re feeling adventurous.

Unlike heavier cakes, this kind of pizza is light enough to eat after a big meal, and the golden crust comes out looking so good you almost don’t want to slice it up. For anyone searching for fruit pizza ideas or just a new take on a homemade easy dessert pizza , this Campanian specialty brings together familiar flavors in a way that feels totally fresh and original. Whether it’s for a family party, a picnic, or just because you feel like something different, this dessert is sure to get people talking—and reaching for another slice. For sure.
To prepare the sweet pizza with strawberry jam, start by dissolving the salt in warm milk (1-2); in another larger bowl, pour the sifted flour and add the dry yeast .
Then add the honey and start working the ingredients with your hands; after a few moments, pour the milk in which you dissolved the salt , add the olive oil , and the grated lemon peel and continue kneading directly in the bowl.
When the dough becomes compact, transfer it to a slightly oiled work surface and knead it until smooth and soft (if it turns out very dry, you can add a little more oil). Once the ball is formed, place it in a slightly oiled bowl , cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for at least 3 hours in the oven with the light on. Meanwhile, focus on the milk cream: heat the milk in a saucepan, add the seeds and the split half vanilla bean .
Stir with a whisk, then add the sugar and the sifted cornstarch , then also add the honey and let it thicken over low heat.
When the cream has thickened, remove the half vanilla bean and pour the cream into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, making sure it adheres well to the surface so that the annoying skin does not form and let it cool in the refrigerator (you can place the bowl in a larger one filled with ice to cool the cream faster). While the cream cools, take back the dough that has doubled in volume
and roll it out on a work surface into a disc with a diameter of 13 inches ; line a cake pan with parchment paper and roll the dough disc onto a rolling pin, then unroll it onto the cake pan . Make sure the bottom adheres well (leave the edges hanging for the moment) and prick the bottom with a fork. Pour the strawberry jam
and spread it evenly using the back of a spoon . Then fold the edges inward and flatten them with a light pressure from your fingertips. Bake the sweet pizza in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 30 minutes (or in a fan oven at 320°F for 20 minutes). Meanwhile, whip the fresh cream and gently fold the now cold milk cream into the whipped cream : mix to combine the two mixtures.
Cover with plastic wrap and keep in the fridge; when the pizza is baked, take it out of the oven, let it cool completely and place the milk cream in a piping bag without a nozzle ; decorate the pizza irregularly to simulate the melting mozzarella .
Finish the sweet pizza with fresh fruit: wash and thinly slice the peach with the peel , then cut the green apple into sticks, removing a little pulp with a knife; remove the leaves from the strawberries and cut them into 4 wedges. Then decorate the sweet pizza with the peach slices, apple , strawberries, and blueberries , while the mint will simulate the basil leaves!
We recommend consuming the sweet pizza immediately to enjoy all the freshness of the fruit and milk cream, but if you want to store it, then place it in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap.
Freezing is not recommended.
Unleash your imagination to decorate the sweet pizza as you like, with seasonal fruit or the fruit of your choice.
