Really, it’s this light, colorful combo that’s full of surprises—really, really good ones. Basmati brings a fragrant aroma and firm grains that don’t get mushy. And look, red rice adds a crunchy texture and a sweet flavor that’s way better than the usual. Pancetta dolce a cubetti ? Turns crispy and a bit salty—can't go wrong there. And some folks even toss in sautéed zucchini and radicchio, which is great for a little bitterness and color. Oh, and mazzancolle prawns? A little taste of the sea, for sure. Together, these ingredients make this rice salad perfect for buffets, picnics, or whenever you’re craving something refreshing and a bit different.

To make the basmati and red rice salad, start by cooking the rice; the cooking times for boiling the two types of rice are different, so you will need to cook them separately: place two pots of water on the stove and bring to a boil , in one pour the red rice and in the other the basmati rice . Boil the red rice for about 30 minutes and the basmati for about 15 minutes (or for the time indicated on the individual packages).
Once cooked, drain the rice and combine them in a large bowl, season with a drizzle of olive oil and mix with a spoon . Wash, trim the zucchini, and cut them into cubes .
Wash the radicchio and cut it into thin strips . Finally, clean the prawns (or shrimp): remove the head, shell , tail, and extract the intestine, then split the prawns in half lengthwise and gently remove the intestine, the internal black thread.
Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a pan, add the sweet bacon cubes and brown them for a few minutes, then add the zucchini and cook for 10 minutes, then add the prawns and continue for 5 minutes.
At this point, turn off the heat and add the radicchio , let it cool, and then incorporate the now cold rice and mix with a spoon to flavor them. The basmati and red rice salad is ready ; serve it immediately or store it in the refrigerator until it's time to bring it to the table.
Store the basmati and red rice salad in the refrigerator for a couple of days covered with plastic wrap. You can freeze the salad if you have used fresh, not thawed ingredients.
Zucchini and radicchio create a perfect combination, but you can experiment with other tasty pairings like peas and carrots, cherry tomatoes and fava beans, you have plenty of choices!
