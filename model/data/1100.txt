instructions:
This saffron risotto really is a celebration of Northern Italian cooking. It's got that creamy texture and bright golden color that's super inviting. Folks in places like Lombardy—where they really, really know their stuff—make a Grana Padano risotto shine with a special step called mantecatura. It's basically mixing in butter and loads of Grana Padano DOP Riserva cheese at the end, which is great. You get this moist, almost luxurious finish that’s seriously good.
And look, the pulled meat? It’s a smart touch. You’re using it for flavor and as the base for your broth—making the whole dish taste rich without wasting anything. The turmeric? It not only adds to that sunny yellow look, but it also mixes with the saffron for a color that really stands out. Plus, throw in some fresh, tender spring asparagus, and you've got yourself an Italian springtime feast.
A shredded meat risotto like this isn’t just filling; it tastes like something you’d find at a trattoria in Milan. The tangy and nutty flavor of Grana Padano risotto is way, way better when paired with the earthy, almost sweet notes from the asparagus. You know, compared to a basic risotto alla Milanese, this version is a bit more rustic. It has that extra punch from the meat. And the way the saffron and turmeric work together? It gives you a plate that looks amazing—really. There's something fun about scooping up that golden rice and getting a bit of everything in each bite. I mean, whether you’re into classic Italian risotto recipes or just want a dish that feels special, this one works for both casual nights and bigger occasions. For real. Trying out these risotto cooking techniques —especially getting the rice nice and creamy—makes the process really satisfying. You end up with a bowl that’s pretty simple and packed with real, honest flavor. It's one of those easy risotto with vegetables meals that always gets people talking and leaves them wanting more. No question.
To prepare the yellow risotto with shredded meat, asparagus, and Grana Padano PDO, start with the meat broth: in a pot, pour the water, the shallot cut in half (you can leave it unpeeled), the cloves, bay leaves, meat, and salt to taste . Cook the broth for at least an hour: you can remove impurities that form on the surface from time to time with a skimmer. Once ready, strain the broth and keep it warm, while you can slice and then shred the meat .
Take the asparagus, cut away the woody part , then wash them, pat them dry, and cut them into slices. Peel and thinly slice the red onions . In a saucepan, pour a drizzle of oil then the onions and sauté over medium heat, stirring often.
When they have softened , you can add the rice . Stir often over medium heat so that the grains toast: a couple of minutes will suffice. Then add the ground turmeric and stir.
Now increase the heat and deglaze with the white wine . Let the alcohol evaporate, then lower the heat, add the asparagus and the meat .
Adjust the salt and then start adding the hot broth to cover the rice, adding more as it gets absorbed . Cook over medium-low heat for about 20 minutes (taste to check the doneness, otherwise continue for a few more minutes). At the end of cooking, turn off the stove and add the cold butter in pieces .
Add the grated Grana Padano PDO . Stir again and let it rest for a moment, covered with a lid, before serving your yellow risotto with shredded meat, asparagus, and Grana Padano PDO piping hot! You can complete the dish with some ground pepper to taste and another sprinkle of Grana Padano PDO .
It is recommended to consume the yellow risotto with boiled meat, asparagus, and Grana Padano PDO immediately.
It can be stored in the fridge and consumed the next day.
Freezing is not recommended.
We don't think so, but if there is leftover risotto, you can make crunchy supplì or croquettes!
You can replace the beef with chicken thighs for the broth and use the meat for the risotto.
