To prepare the fava bean salad, start by cleaning the pods . Don't throw them away because you might prepare a tasty Sautéed Broad Bean Peels . If you want, you can wear gloves to shell the beans. Once the pods are opened, shell them and collect the beans in a container .
Put a pot of water on the fire and bring it to a boil. Meanwhile, remove the growth covering the seed and shell again; this way, you'll have the tenderest and sweetest part of the seed . When the water is boiling, drop in the shelled seeds , letting them cook for no more than 4 minutes since they should remain a bit crunchy. At the end of cooking, rinse them under running water and let them drain .
In the meantime, prepare the sauce for flavoring by pouring extra virgin olive oil into a small bowl along with balsamic vinegar . Add salt and pepper , then using a potato peeler or a knife, making sure not to scrape off the white part of the lemon, which is very bitter, peel the lemon zest .
Then cut into thin strips , add them to the bowl with the oil , and briefly emulsify everything with a fork .
Finally, pour the sauce into the container with the fava bean seeds , mix , and place on the serving dish where you will add cheese shavings to further flavor the fava bean salad .
Shelled beans can be stored before use, but once cooked and/or seasoned, they should be consumed immediately as they don't last long.
Try adding a few leaves of thyme, basil, or mint to perfume and enhance the taste, otherwise, a clove of garlic, in this case, you could even press it!
Instead of Pecorino, try some Parmigiano Reggiano PDO for a more delicate taste.
