instructions:
To prepare the green stuffed ravioli, start with the fresh pasta. In a tall and narrow container, pour the eggs and the cooked and strained spinach . Blend with an immersion blender to obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream .
Place the flour on the work surface and make a well, pour almost all the spinach cream in the center , set aside a little to better calibrate the dosage based on how the flour absorbs the liquids. Mix first with a fork and then knead by hand .
Once you have obtained a homogeneous dough , wrap it with plastic wrap and let it rest covered for at least half an hour in a cool place. Move on to the filling: in a bowl, pour the well-drained ricotta and season it with salt, pepper, and nutmeg .
Add the lemon zest and grated Parmigiano Reggiano DOP . Mix to blend the flavors .
Transfer the ricotta cream into a piping bag . After resting, the fresh pasta will be softer and more elastic, roll out a part of the dough with a little flour on the work surface and roll it with the pasta machine to the maximum thickness . Fold the two edges of the sheet towards the center and then dust again with a little flour.
Pass it through the rollers again to the penultimate thickness to obtain a sheet about 1/8 inch thick , once you have obtained a rectangular sheet, place it on the lightly floured work surface and trim the edges with a dough cutter. Use the piping bag to create circles .
Place the yolk in the center . Cover with another sheet, seal well to release the air . Cut the ravioli with a slightly larger cutter (we used one with a diameter of 3 inches) .
Once the ravioli are formed , place them on a tray sprinkled with semolina , well-spaced to prevent them from sticking .
In a pan, melt the butter , add the sage and when it is browned, pour a ladle of hot water .
Thicken the sauce and set it aside . Boil the ravioli in salted boiling water , then drain them in the pan with the sauce and add another pat of butter.
Saute for a few moments to flavor . Plate by pouring the sauce on the bottom , then the ravioli, and finish with a sprinkle of grated Parmigiano Reggiano DOP. The green stuffed ravioli is ready to be served .
We recommend consuming the ravioli immediately. You can freeze the raw ravioli, place them on a tray well spaced and put them in the freezer. Once solidified, you can transfer them to more practical freezer bags.
If the dough does not completely absorb the flour or is slightly hard, add one or two tablespoons of warm water and continue kneading until it is smooth and compact. With the leftover egg whites, you can make an Egg White Omelette or our plumcake with leftover egg whites!
