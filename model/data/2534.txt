To prepare the lollipops, put the granulated sugar in a saucepan. Add the orange flavoring , the powdered food coloring , and the cream of tartar .
Pour in the water and turn on the heat. Stir slightly over moderate heat with a spoon and bring to a temperature between 293°F and 302°F, measuring with a kitchen thermometer .
At this point, dip the saucepan with the syrup you've obtained into a bowl full of cold water for a second to stop the cooking . Using a spoon, pour a small portion of caramel onto a silicone mat (alternatively, you can use a sheet of parchment paper) , trying to create a round shape .
Place a lollipop stick in the center of each circle (alternatively, you can use wooden coffee stirrers or ice cream sticks) : with our quantities, you should make 14 lollipops; once finished , let them cool at room temperature for at least 40 minutes. After the necessary time has passed, you can serve your fun and colorful lollipops on a nice bonbon holder !
You can store your lollipops for up to 1 week away from sources of moisture.
Let your imagination and colors run wild! Try mixing the colorings to achieve different hues! Here are some very useful technical tips: for a better result, instead of common sugar, it is advisable to use isomalt as it has excellent hygroscopic properties, so your lollipops will be more resistant to moisture; cream of tartar, on the other hand, has an anti-crystallizing function, which will help to obtain shiny and transparent lollipops.
