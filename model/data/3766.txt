Golden-brown pan roasted quail resting over a bed of perfectly creamy arborio rice gives this quail risotto its beautiful, inviting appearance—a welcome sight at any Italian family table.

If you want a meal that looks inviting, tastes even BETTER, and fits both weeknight rotation and celebration style, quail risotto checks all the boxes with its creamy , soft texture, and rich, comforting flavor.
For the preparation of risotto with quails, get 16 quail thighs, 4 per person: before proceeding with the preparation, it is advisable to flame the thighs for a few moments to remove any remaining feathers. In a pan, put 5 tablespoons of oil, a sprig of rosemary, a few sage leaves, a clove of crushed garlic, and the quail thighs which you will brown for a couple of minutes on each side, adding a dash of pepper;
as soon as the quail thighs have reached a brown color, drizzle them with half a glass of white wine and deglaze everything; when the wine has evaporated, remove the quail thighs and keep them warm. From the same pan, remove the rosemary and sage; clean and chop the onion, let it soften in a small pan with 1.5 tablespoons of butter, and pour it directly into the same cooking pan of the quails, add the rice, and toast it in the created sauce, drizzle it with the other half glass of wine and finish the cooking by adding a ladle of broth each time the rice dries out.
In the meantime, take 8 of the 16 thighs set aside and debone them, shredding the meat that you will add to the cooking rice; at the end of cooking, turn off the heat ensuring it is correctly salted, add the remaining butter and the grated Grana Padano PDO, then mix well to blend.
Now plate the risotto, garnishing the top with two quail thighs per plate.
If you want to make this dish richer and tastier, you can add some diced bacon during the browning phase of the quail thighs.
