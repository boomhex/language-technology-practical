instructions:
The Mimosa cocktail, a light and refreshing drink made with orange juice and sparkling wine, is beloved around the world. The original Mimosa was concocted by a bartender at the Ritz Hotel in Paris in 1925. This cocktail was named after the yellow mimosa flower, which it resembled in color. Interestingly, a few years earlier in London, an almost identical cocktail emerged, known as the Buck’s Fizz, named after the bar where it was created. In Italy, the Mimosa is considered an aperitif, but in the United States, it's a popular choice for Sunday brunches, serving as a 'bubbly' alternative to orange juice. It pairs wonderfully with French toast and maple syrup pancakes . Will you try this idea at your next brunch?
To prepare the Mimosa, squeeze the orange - about half of it - and pour the juice into a flute glass . Then add well-chilled Brut sparkling wine (spumante) .
From the remaining orange, cut out a crescent-shaped slice , and make a small incision in the slice so you can place it on the rim of the glass . Your Mimosa cocktail is now ready to be enjoyed !
The Mimosa cocktail should be consumed immediately.
If you want to add an extra touch to your Mimosa cocktail, a splash of grenadine is just the thing!
