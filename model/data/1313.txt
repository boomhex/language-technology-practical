instructions:
To make the red wine granita, start by preparing the syrup: pour the sugar and water into a pot . Bring to the heat and warm the mixture until it comes to a boil , cook on high heat for 2 minutes and then pour in the wine .
Let it simmer for 3 minutes , then pour the liquid into a jug and let it cool at room temperature . Pour the mixture into the ice cream maker's container . Follow the instructions for your ice cream maker: for the one we used, it's not necessary to pre-chill the container in the fridge.
Close with the lid and let it churn for about 30 minutes. After this time, the red wine granita will be ready when it is creamy and compact , serve in chilled glasses to prevent it from melting quickly and enjoy immediately .
The red wine granita can be stored in the freezer for 1 month.
You can also choose a white wine to make this granita; however, we recommend opting for a sparkling wine with a low alcohol content. To flavor this granita, you can add spices such as cinnamon or vanilla.
You can serve with fresh mint leaves or blueberries.
