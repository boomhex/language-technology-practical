To prepare rustic lactose-free cookies, first pour the flour into a bowl, add the sugar , the baking powder , and the lemon zest .
Mix with your hands and pour in an egg , then gradually add the rice milk and the olive oil
Knead by hand to combine all the ingredients . Once you have a smooth dough , wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. After this time, take the dough and divide it into pieces of about 1.6 oz each , you should get at least 10.
Form a small loaf with each piece of dough and as you form the cookies, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Create slashes on the surface of the cookies with the tip of a knife .
Dust the surface of the cookies with granulated sugar , then bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 25 minutes. Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven, let them cool slightly, and then dust the surface with powdered sugar . The rustic lactose-free cookies are ready to be served .
The rustic lactose-free cookies can be stored in a tin box for up to 5 days, and you can freeze them after baking.
