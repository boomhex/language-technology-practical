Add another drizzle of oil and bake in a preheated oven at 392°F (convection mode) for 30 minutes, shaking the tray a couple of times during cooking to turn them. If they are not golden enough, turn on the grill for 5 minutes. Let your crispy baked chickpeas cool before serving !
We recommend consuming the crispy chickpeas as soon as they are ready. Alternatively, you can store them at room temperature for up to one day in an airtight jar.
You can use hot paprika and flavor the crispy baked chickpeas with other herbs or spices.
Don't throw away the chickpea water, known as aquafaba: you can use it to prepare other vegan recipes like Eggless Frittata or Vegan meringues !
