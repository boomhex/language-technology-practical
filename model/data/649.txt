When autumn rolls in, there's just something about the rich, golden flavors of pumpkin risotto —really comforting stuff. Plus, when you add a layer of creamy pecorino, it brings a touch of sweet and tangy magic to the whole dish. In Northern Italy, especially around Lombardy , they've totally nailed this classic risotto with pumpkin . And you know what? Chef Giuseppe Mancino takes it up a notch by crafting a dish that perfectly balances the tender rice with silky pumpkin cream. Really, the deep, rustic pumpkin notes—so so good—blend beautifully with pecorino. It adds a moist, spicy kick that just keeps you coming back for more. It's Italian autumn cuisine at its best: simple ingredients, cooked to perfection—totally cozy and a little bit fancy.
Across Lombardy and the North, everyone has their own twist on creamy pumpkin risotto . Some folks add gorgonzola for a bolder flavor, while others toss in speck or sausage for that extra savory bite. Pretty much every version treats you to a super creamy texture and a great mix of sweet and savory. This version, though, really stands out with its pecorino sauce, adding an extra layer of flavor that just sets it apart. It's the kind of pumpkin and pecorino risotto that's perfect for a dinner with friends or a laid-back family night. For real, it has that Italian knack of turning local, in-season ingredients into something special.
So, if you’re eager to try a new fall risotto with pumpkin or want an easy risotto recipe that feels a bit gourmet—here’s the deal—it’s a winner. Serve it up and enjoy the golden and smooth rice, soaking in all that pumpkin cream, with pecorino melting right in. One bite, and you'll really understand why this is a true Northern Italian favorite when the weather cools down.

Place the vegetables in a large pot, cover with water, and season with peppercorns and cloves . Turn on the heat and cook for about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the Pecorino cream: in a small pot, pour the cream, grated pecorino , and Parmigiano Reggiano PDO.
Bring to a boil, stirring with a whisk . When the cheese has melted, remove the pot from the heat and blend with an immersion blender to obtain a smooth and velvety cream .
Move on to the pumpkin cream: clean and slice half an onion , then in a pan, pour a drizzle of oil, the cherry tomatoes , and whole chili peppers .
Continue with the onion and sage , salt and pepper . Let it sauté over moderate heat.
Meanwhile, clean the pumpkin: remove the seeds , peel the skin , and cut into cubes .

Once the pumpkin is ready, remove the sage, pepper, and cloves . Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add the cream and a ladle of the vegetable broth .
Season with curry and blend with an immersion blender , then adjust the salt .
Strain the cream through a sieve to make it smoother ; if you prefer, you can skip this step. Prepare the rice: in a saucepan, melt the butter and oil .
Add the rice, salt, and let it toast until the grains are hot . Meanwhile, retrieve the broth you have prepared and strain it .
The broth is ready , pour it gradually into the rice to cook it . After about 6-7 minutes, also incorporate the pumpkin cream and finish cooking.
When the rice is ready, stir in the cheese and butter and mix everything. Serve the risotto with pumpkin cream immediately, garnished with pecorino cream, sage leaves, toasted hazelnuts, and coffee powder !

You can use cumin or ginger, fresh or powdered, as an alternative to curry.
