instructions:
To prepare Grana Padano breadsticks, first dissolve the yeast in water by stirring with a spoon . Pour the flour and grated Grana Padano PDO into a bowl and salt .
Gradually pour in the water in which you dissolved the yeast and also incorporate the olive oil . Mix with your hands to blend the ingredients and absorb the liquids .
Once you have obtained a homogeneous mixture, transfer it to a work surface and knead it further to create a compact dough . Transfer it to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rise for 1 hour in the oven with the light on or in a warm environment. After this time, your dough will have risen .
Sprinkle a work surface with some flour , roll out the dough with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 1/8 inch .
Using a smooth cutting wheel, cut strips about 3/4 inch wide . Roll the strips with your hands on the work surface to form the classic breadsticks and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the surface of the breadsticks with water .
Distribute the seeds to taste and bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for 18 minutes. Once cooked, take the Grana Padano breadsticks out of the oven and let them cool slightly before enjoying them .
Store Grana Padano breadsticks in paper bags and consume them within a week.
Those who love exotic aromas can enrich the breadstick dough with paprika or turmeric.
