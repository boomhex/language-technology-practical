instructions:
To prepare the risotto with turnip tops, anchovies, and garlic sauce, first peel the garlic cloves. Pour 5 oz (150 g) of milk into a small saucepan, add the garlic , and bring to a boil. Drain with a slotted spoon and place the garlic in a small bowl . Discard the boiled milk and pour another 5 oz (150 g) of milk, repeating the same process 3 more times.
At the end of this process, transfer the garlic cloves to a pitcher along with 1.7 oz (50 g) of milk , then blend until you obtain a silky sauce . Cover with plastic wrap and keep in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Clean the turnip greens, separating the tops from the leaves . Blanch the leaves in boiling salted water for a few minutes , then drain and cool in ice water .
Blanch the tops in the same water , then drain and cool in ice water . Keep the cooking water hot; it will be used to cook the rice. Transfer the turnip leaves to a pitcher .
Add the oil , then adjust with salt and pepper .
Blend until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous sauce . In a pan, pour the oil and add the turnip tops .
Adjust with salt and pepper and sauté over high heat for a few minutes . In a saucepan, dry toast the rice for a few minutes .
Deglaze with white wine and let all the alcohol evaporate, then cover with hot cooking water until the rice is submerged by about an inch; it will take about 1 quart of liquid. Cook the rice, keeping it quite dry .
Turn off the heat and add the turnip top sauce , then stir in the cold butter in pieces and the Parmesan cheese .
Mix everything well . Plate the risotto, garnishing with whole turnip tops and a spoonful of garlic cream .
Finish with 2-3 anchovy fillets and the crumbled taralli . Your risotto with turnip tops, anchovies, and garlic sauce is ready to be enjoyed !
It is advisable to consume the risotto with turnip tops, anchovies, and garlic sauce right after it's prepared.
Instead of taralli, you can use toasted bread crumbs.
For a more rustic version, you can replace the anchovies with crumbled and browned sausage!
