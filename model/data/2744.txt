instructions:
To make vegetable chips, start by cutting the pumpkin into wedges, then remove the peel with a knife and slice finely with a mandoline . Peel the beetroot
slice it with the mandoline to get thin slices . Finally, peel the potatoes and proceed as you did with the other vegetables: slice with the mandoline to get rather thin slices .
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, place the beetroot slices on it, drizzle with a little olive oil, season with salt, and add a few sprigs of rosemary . Bake the beetroot chips in a fan oven at 428°F for 20 minutes or until they dry (or in a static oven at 446°F for 40 minutes). Once cooked, take the chips out and transfer them to a rack to cool .
Now continue with the pumpkin: spread the pumpkin slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, season with olive oil, salt, and rosemary , bake the pumpkin chips in a fan oven at 428°F for 10 minutes (or in a static oven at 446°F for 40 minutes). Once crispy, remove them , place them on a rack, and leave them there until completely cool .
Finally, proceed in the same way with the potatoes: place the potato slices on the baking sheet lined with parchment paper , bake the potato chips in the same mode in a fan oven at 428°F for 10 minutes (or in a static oven at 446°F for 15 minutes), once cooked, the potatoes will be golden and crispy, take them out and let them cool on the rack .
Store the vegetable chips in a food bag. Freezing is not recommended.
