Home cooks like knowing the dish feels gourmet with DECADENT flavors, yet still fits family tables—versatile enough for holidays or just creating simple , lasting dinnertime memories (always a win with beef fans).

Seriously DELICIOUS...just right for making any family gathering (or even a regular Sunday) feel extra special.
After removing any fibrous or excessively fatty parts from the piece of meat , proceed with cutting and tying the fillet to keep it in shape during cooking.
Brush the fillets with melted butter , then prepare the rub by simply mixing all the spices thoroughly , then dip only the edges of the fillet in the rub, making it adhere well (6-7). This will allow us to check the fillet's cooking on the exposed parts, which would otherwise become difficult due to the dark color of the rub.
Meanwhile, prepare the charcoal grill with a setup for Direct cooking. In the meantime, you can proceed with preparing the sauce . Pour the wine into a saucepan along with star anise, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Let it simmer gently until the sauce coats the spoon. Turn off the heat, transfer to a container along with the spices, and let cool .
Prepare the coffee by infusing some crushed cardamom pods. The pumpkin puree is simply made by baking some pieces of pumpkin until fully caramelized. Blend with hot water or vegetable broth. Season with salt and pepper and add 4 or 5 drops of lemon juice per cup of puree. When the coals are ready, grill the fillets , preferably on a cast iron grill or griddle to get very marked sear lines, otherwise impossible to achieve on regular steel grills. When the lines form, rotate the fillets 90° on the vertical axis to allow a diamond pattern to form. Once the core temperature reaches 131°F , remove from heat and place the fillet in two disposable aluminum trays using one as a lid. This will allow the juices to distribute and the temperature to rise, despite being removed from the heat, by another 2 or 3 degrees.
During the resting of the meat, proceed with preparing the coffee foam. Mix a few drops of hot coffee into the soy lecithin and then pour everything into the coffee container. Blend with an immersion mixer , making sure to incorporate a lot of air. The foam that forms will be quite stable and will not tend to dissolve quickly. To plate, simply place a layer of sauce on the plate along with a drizzle of fine extra virgin olive oil. Place the fillet, remembering to remove the string , add the chives and pumpkin puree. The coffee foam will be added at the last moment.
