Bright, cheerful slices of candied clementines always catch the eye with their beautiful pop of color —they look especially nice scattered across plates at family gatherings or weekend celebrations. Sweet, citrusy flavor and a lovely soft texture together give these sugar-coated candied clementines instant appeal for anyone who enjoys easy, family desserts. Kids and adults usually love the balance of sweet taste with just a hint of that classic citrus bite (really wakes up any spread). Since these slices keep their vibrant look and chewy feel, they make for a clementine garnish that’s not just pretty but DELICIOUS too—think of those special cakes, citrus desserts, or even simple cupcakes needing a little extra flair. Eye-catching and packed with sweet citrus goodness, these treats make every dessert feel just a bit brighter (families notice when dessert looks this good, trust me). Home cooks turn to these often for reliability—results are always inviting, and the beautiful finish works well all year round on dessert tables, buffets, or whenever you want something versatile that stands out.
Weeknight desserts can go from plain to something a little special with the help of candied clementines —super easy for busy families craving versatile toppings. Since moist , delicious rings can serve as a gourmet dessert topping , there’s a lot you can do with them on cakes, blondies, even a quick bowl of ice cream (honestly, works great as a citrus dessert snack too). Add a handful of candied orange peel or try mixing both as a nice surprise topping—colorful, SCENTED, and always a conversation starter at holiday parties or birthday celebrations. Families like how these flexible slices make every citrus recipe feel polished, and that leftover syrup? Works wonders for drizzling over pancakes or stirring into a fun brunch cocktail. Because these treats use the whole peel, you’re getting real value—from garnishing to snacking. All in all, for anyone who wants an easy upgrade and something cheerful for family desserts or simple parties, candied clementines deliver— soft , juicy, nice texture and a finish everyone remembers, with enough citrus magic to make any bite truly special.
Take 12 clementines, wash them, dry them, and cut them into four parts without removing the peel. Meanwhile, prepare a syrup by dissolving 4.6 oz of sugar in 2 cups of water, then pour the clementines into it; bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and let the clementines cool immersed in the liquid until the next day. The following day, add 4.6 oz of sugar to the clementines, bring back to a boil, and let simmer for 5 minutes; let cool and proceed like this for another 3 days, adding 4.6 oz of sugar each day (5 days of boiling for a total of 23 oz of sugar). After boiling the clementines for the last time, drain them from the remaining syrup in the pot and lay them out to dry on a baking sheet (or on a rack) for at least 24 hours, preferably in a cool and ventilated place.
Candied clementines are a great idea to enjoy at Christmas: place them on the table along with dried fruit, or use them to garnish cakes, pies, ice creams, semifreddos, etc... You can store candied clementines in cool glass jars for a few months.
