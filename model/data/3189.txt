Biscotti arlecchino are a blast during Carnevale —that wild, colorful celebration with masks and shows. These aren’t your run-of-the-mill cookies. They’re all about sweet moments and good times, bursting with bright sprinkles. They look just as festive as the parades and costumes. Thing is, they give Italian rainbow cookies and tricolor cookies a fun twist. Forget the layers and almond paste. Here, it’s about keeping it simple and playful. You roll them in all the colors you can think of. Kids love them. I mean, who wouldn’t? Making them usually means the whole family joins in, laughing and getting a little messy. The sprinkles do more than look pretty—they make the outside crunchy and crispy, adding to that lighthearted Carnevale spirit.
During Carnevale, you’ll find these Venetian cookies at birthday parties and gatherings. Pretty much wherever there's a celebration. People love how they fit with the mood. They’re golden inside, moist enough to stay soft, and so, so easy to make. Even the youngest can help. In many Italian homes, it's tradition for kids to roll dough in rainbow sprinkles—turning baking into an event almost as fun as eating them. And look, while some might think of layered cookies or those famous almond-flavored sponge cakes, biscotti arlecchino go for pure color and tender bites. They stand out for sure. They’re not about fancy fillings or chocolate coatings but about bringing everyone together to share a sweet, cheerful snack. No matter how many treats show up at Carnevale, these cookies always get a smile—there’s just something about those tricolor cookies , colorful sprinkles, and Carnevale vibes that makes people of every age want to grab another handful. Really, they just do. It’s kind of magic.
To prepare the harlequin cookies, beat the softened room temperature butter with powdered sugar using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or electric beaters until light and fluffy. Add the salt and eggs , then mix until all ingredients are well combined.
Sift the flour and add the baking soda together, then add them to the mixture one tablespoon at a time , continuing to mix until the dry ingredients are well incorporated into the mixture.
When the dough is smooth, add the colored sprinkles, reserving some for decorating the cookies, and mix very quickly to avoid them melting . Now form the cookies: place small heaps of dough, about 1 oz each, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper .
Shape each heap into a sphere and flatten them slightly. Then place a few of the reserved colored sprinkles on each cookie . Bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 10 minutes (or a convection oven at 320°F for 7-8 minutes), or until the cookies are golden at the edges. Remove from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack : here are your cheerful harlequin cookies ready!
Store the harlequin cookies in a tin box or a closed glass jar for 4-5 days. You can freeze the uncooked harlequin cookies and bake them directly from frozen.
A brief nostalgic memory of the happy times when the girls were little: when one had a birthday, or I organized Carnival parties, I would make these cookies and, packed in colorful bags, give them to all the young guests! I also enriched some with chocolate chips, grated lemon zest, or chopped almonds and hazelnuts, dedicating them to the parents who accompanied their children.
