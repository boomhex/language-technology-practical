instructions:
To prepare the sautéed pumpkin with rosemary and white wine, start by cutting the pumpkin into pieces and removing the skin . Then take the pumpkin flesh obtained and cut it into chunks the size of a walnut . Place the oil in a pan, and let the garlic cloves (1-2 as preferred) turn golden; once golden, you can choose to remove them or leave them in the pan. Add the pumpkin pieces
and the chopped rosemary and sauté them in a pan until the pumpkin is nicely browned. Take the white wine and sprinkle it over the pumpkin , letting it evaporate, then add salt. Continue cooking the pumpkin for about 10 minutes. Add pepper to taste and serve immediately!
Store the sautéed pumpkin with rosemary in the refrigerator for up to a couple of days, sealed tightly in a container.
This side dish is phenomenal when paired with grilled meat or, even better, roast. No matter which main course you want to serve it with, though, the important thing is the quality of the pumpkin: it should be yellow and firm, like the Mantovana or Marina di Chioggia, which are round, flattened at the poles, and have a wrinkled, gray-green rind.
