So here's the thing, if you're craving that southern Italy vibe, this single-serving gratin really hits the spot. Originating from Campania, this dish mixes up the classic potato gratin with pumpkin and sausage for a twist that's just delicious. Imagine digging into a bite that's both tender and crispy on top—really, can't go wrong with that—thanks to the provola cheese. It melts into this gooey, moist delight. The sweet pumpkin goes so, so well with the savory sausage. And the cheese? It adds a rich, melty finish that's hard to beat. Topped with a sprinkle of fresh thyme, this sausage gratin brings a fresh, herby aroma as it comes out of the oven.
And listen, this individual gratin recipe is perfect when you want to impress guests without much fuss. For sure. Instead of a giant casserole, each person gets their own cocotte, so everyone can dig into that golden, cheesy crust. In Campania, local sausage with a hint of spice is often used, and look, it complements the sweet pumpkin and creamy potatoes beautifully. While some might swap out provola for other cheeses, it's that stretchy, almost stringy texture that gives this pumpkin gratin its genuine Italian comfort food vibe.
Whether you think of it as a new take on baked potato or a sausage gratin , it's all about the layers: a soft, tangy filling and a bubbling top that's rich without being too heavy. For those who love a good homemade gratin , this is a simple way to bring a bit of southern Italian flair to the table. Especially when the weather turns cool, and you crave something warm and satisfying. Enjoying this dish is like wrapping yourself in a cozy Italian show—seriously good—perfect for any evening when you need a little comfort on your plate.
To prepare the single-serving gratin of potatoes, pumpkin, and sausage, place a pot with plenty of salted water on the stove, which you will use for the Vegetable broth . Cut the pumpkin into slices, removing the filaments and inner seeds. Remove the skin , then cut it into strips and then into cubes . Peel the potatoes with a vegetable peeler, cut them into slices
and then into cubes . Place a non-stick pot on the stove with oil; add the potatoes and diced pumpkin , seasoning with salt and pepper to your liking.
Add the thyme leaves and cook for 15 minutes, covering with a lid and pouring in the vegetable broth .
Meanwhile, cut the sausage in half , gently remove the casing with your fingers , then finely chop it with a knife or crumble it with your hands .
Sauté the sausage over the heat for 4-5 minutes , spreading it with a kitchen spatula for even cooking . After the necessary time, pass the cooked potatoes and pumpkin through a potato ricer
until you get a smooth purée . Also add the crumbled sausage (set aside 3-4 tablespoons), the grated cheese, the thyme leaves ,
salt, pepper , and nutmeg , then mix well to combine all the ingredients .
Finally, add the diced provolone, keeping aside 2 tablespoons for later use . Brush 6 ramekins with a diameter of 3.5 inches and a height of 2 inches with oil , then sprinkle them with breadcrumbs, ensuring it adheres well to the sides and base .
At this point, fill the ramekins to the brim with the mixture you prepared and, once finished, level the surface with the back of a spoon . Finish your gratins by spreading crumbled sausage on the surface
and the diced provolone you set aside , then arrange the filled ramekins on a baking sheet , baking in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 10 minutes (or at 356°F for 7-8 minutes if using a convection oven); finally, you can remove and serve your single-serving gratin of potatoes, pumpkin, and sausage directly in the ramekins .
You can store the single-serving gratin of potatoes, pumpkin, and sausage for up to 2-3 days in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
This gratin truly has it all: softness, flavor, crunchiness, in short ... it's a real delight! Why not try replacing the provolone with diced mozzarella or with a not-too-mature cheese of your choice? You'll taste the difference!
