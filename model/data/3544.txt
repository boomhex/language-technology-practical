Golden ribbons of straw and hay pasta with mixed meats and mushrooms look beautiful next to the green spinach fettuccine—really eye-catching on a family table. The combo of creamy textures and a warm scent from oven-warmed Parmesan cheese on top always gets attention because it just feels inviting. Bits of savory prosciutto and chunks of hearty mixed meats pair perfectly with mushrooms for a meal everyone recognizes as real traditional Italian pasta comfort. At family gatherings or weeknight dinners, it’s the kind of satisfying pasta dish that looks great and always draws people in…those pretty colors, rich flavors, and that cozy feeling in one bowl. Even picky eaters tend to like the blend of mild yet deep flavor, especially with all those little pockets of good cheese, mushrooms, and soft pasta ribbons (nice with a little extra sprinkling of Parmesan cheese right before serving). This dish fits everything from cold-weather cozy nights to big Sunday suppers—its visual pop and real Italian comfort vibe mean it’s as welcome when you want something “fancier” as when you just need dinner to hit the spot.

Perfect for busy nights—everyone’s hungry, you want something with Italian goodness, and there’s not much fuss since it’s familiar but still DELICIOUS. You get reliable results, family-friendly taste, and a dish that feels both special and totally practical, especially topped with lots of melty cheese. With its beautiful appearance and balanced flavor, straw and hay pasta with mixed meats and mushrooms becomes one of those go-to easy dinner options that usually gets a happy reaction at the table. It’s a soft , creamy , and utterly inviting meal that really does it all for families looking to enjoy traditional Italian pasta comfort any night of the week.
To prepare the straw and hay tagliatelle with mixed meats and mushrooms, start by scoring the sausage, then remove the casing and gently take it off with your hands. Crumble the sausage and then cut the pork , beef, chicken, and turkey into small cubes. Finely chop the sage and rosemary leaves with a knife , then cut the chili pepper and remove the seeds.
Take all the cherry tomatoes and wash them well under fresh running water; then cut them into cubes . Once cut, set them aside and proceed with How to Clean Porcini Mushrooms : with a smooth-bladed knife, start removing the earthy part on the stem, scraping it gently until any trace of soil is eliminated . If the mushrooms are quite clean, remove the few soil residues with a brush or a cotton cloth (if instead they are still very dirty, pass them quickly under a stream of cold running water).
Once cleaned, cut the whole mushrooms lengthwise and set aside. With a knife, cut the celery, carrot, and onion into slices , place everything in a blender, and chop them . Now that you have everything ready, devote yourself to the ragù.
In a non-stick pot, pour a drizzle of olive oil and cook the chopped vegetables obtained for about 5 minutes , stirring with a spatula; then add the finely chopped aromatic herbs , the garlic clove, and the chili pepper .
Subsequently, add the meats you had previously cut into cubes: the pork , the beef, the crumbled sausage , and the chicken ;
also add the turkey and brown everything for at least 10-15 minutes. Add two bay leaves and then pour the white wine over the meat, letting it evaporate .
When the wine has evaporated, add the diced cherry tomatoes you had prepared to the meat ragù and season with salt and pepper to your liking. In the meantime, bring a pot of abundant salted water to a boil, which will be used to cook the pasta, while you finish by adding the mushrooms to the rest of the ingredients and let everything cook for another 10-15 minutes over high heat, adding (if necessary) some pasta cooking water. Once the mixed meats and mushrooms sauce is ready, turn off the heat, making sure to leave a bit of sauce at the bottom of the pan; then use kitchen tongs to remove the garlic clove .
When the water has reached a boil, cook the straw and hay tagliatelle for the time indicated on the package, leaving them al dente ; once ready, drain them, reserving a little cooking water, and sauté them for a few seconds in the pan with the meat and vegetable dressing . Use a spatula to gently mix to blend the ingredients well and to flavor them. Serve the straw and hay tagliatelle with mixed meat and mushrooms hot .
You can store the straw and hay with mixed meats and mushrooms in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
This dish is really rich and finger-licking good! You should know that you can prepare it at any time of the year, as you will just need to use good quality dried or frozen mushrooms. To prepare the straw and hay with mixed meats, we used excellent porcini mushrooms, but you can also replace them with other mushrooms, choosing among those you most like, such as champignons or chiodini.
