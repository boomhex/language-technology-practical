Cheesecake bicolore is one of those desserts that looks way fancier than it really is. Really. This American-style treat gets a playful twist with its two-tone filling: one layer's all about the creamy goodness of whipped cream, and the other pops with a sweet, slightly tangy hit from sour cherries. What really sets this cheesecake apart isn’t just the taste—it’s that cool, concentric swirl pattern from layering spoonfuls of each filling right in the center. It's like a simple cheesecake senza cottura turned into something that'll make people stop and stare before digging in. The cookie crust? Holds everything together and adds a nice little crunch—so so good with the smooth, rich filling.
People love a chilled cheesecake panna e amarene at parties and picnics. And listen, it feels extra special but is secretly pretty simple to throw together—even if you’re not big on baking. The alternating creams aren’t just for looks: you get a little sweet and a bit of tangy in every bite, which is great and keeps things interesting. The sour cherries give a pop of color and a juicy, almost moist texture that really really works with the lighter, fluffier cream mixture. When you cut into this dessert, the bicolored pattern just pops—seriously fancy, no extra decorations needed.
This dessert is perfect for anyone who loves a good spoon dessert or any kind of cheesecake recipe, especially in the summer when you want something chilled and easy. It’s the kind of treat that works for both special occasions and just when you feel like indulging in something a little more special without a lot of fuss. Whether it's a family gathering or a casual get-together, this cheesecake is sure to impress with its colorful colors and great taste. And you know what? You can’t go wrong with that.
To make the two-tone cheesecake with cream and black cherries, start by melting the butter (in the microwave or a double boiler), then place the cookies in the mixer , finely chop them and then place them in a bowl, add the melted butter , mix to combine the dough and transfer it to a 9-inch diameter springform pan previously buttered and lined with parchment paper .
Press the mixture onto the bottom with the back of a spoon to form the base and then place it to set in the refrigerator for about 1 hour. In the meantime, prepare the cream: in a bowl, mix with a whisk the cream cheese with 1 1/4 cups of cream and then also add the powdered sugar . Divide the cream into two bowls and set them aside.
In 2 different small pots, heat 1/4 cup of cream on one side and 1/4 on the other, and dissolve the agar-agar powder, 4 grams for each pot , bring to a boil, then temper with a few spoons of cream and mix everything . This operation will prevent lumps from forming; if they do form, pass the cream through a mixer. Pour the two agar-agar mixtures into their respective bowls and mix to obtain a homogeneous cream.
Place the black cherries and their syrup in a tall container and blend them with an immersion blender to obtain a puree to add to one of the two creams . You will have a light cream and a pink one. Retrieve the base from the refrigerator and start forming the cheesecake: one spoon at a time, always poured in the center , it will gradually spread. To help with this operation, you can gently tap the pan. Continue like this until you have finished all the creams.
This operation will create a very scenic concentric design. Once the creams are finished , let the cheesecake set in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. After the resting time, unmold the cheesecake, whip the cream with the powdered sugar, dry the black cherries well from their juice, and then decorate the cheesecake with dollops of whipped cream and syrupy black cherries .
Store the two-tone cheesecake with cream and black cherries for 2-3 days in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap. The dessert can be frozen, perhaps in slices, so you can thaw only the necessary portions.
Chocolate enthusiasts can make the base by replacing the cookies with cocoa biscuits. The result will be fantastic!
