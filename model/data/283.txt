instructions:
To prepare the kale and chickpea burgers, first clean the kale by separating the stems from the leaves , then roughly chop the leaves . Place the kale in a pot with boiling salted water .
Cook the kale for about ten minutes , then drain it to remove excess water . In a pan, sauté a garlic clove in a drizzle of oil .
Add the well-drained kale , salt, and pepper , and sauté for about 10 minutes over medium heat. Turn off the heat, remove the garlic , and let it cool slightly.
In a mixer, add the drained chickpeas and lemon juice , then add the kale .
Add the oil and salt , then blend to obtain a fairly coarse texture, not perfectly smooth .
Transfer the mixture to a bowl, then add the egg and the breadcrumbs, little by little . Mix well with a fork to combine everything, adjusting the amount of breadcrumbs according to the consistency .
Form the burgers by compacting and slightly flattening some of the mixture on the palm of your hand ; to get a more precise shape, you can use a glass or a pastry cutter. With these quantities, you will get 6 burgers with a diameter of about 3.5 inches (9 cm). Place them on a tray lined with parchment paper on which you have sprinkled some more breadcrumbs, and cover both sides lightly . You are ready for cooking: place the burgers in a non-stick pan in which you have heated a little oil .
Cook the burgers over medium heat for 5 minutes on each side , until they form a golden crust . Your kale and chickpea burgers are ready to be served with a side dish and a sauce of your choice !
The kale and chickpea burgers can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days, in an airtight container.
You can freeze them raw and store them in the freezer for up to a week.
If you prefer, you can bake the kale and chickpea burgers at 356°F (180°C) for about 20 minutes.
