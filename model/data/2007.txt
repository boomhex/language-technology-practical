When you're juggling a busy day, having homemade snack bars ready can really, really save you. I mean, they're just perfect for mornings or afternoons when you need something moist and filling. Made with dried fruits, nuts, and just a hint of sweetness, these bars are way better—so much better—than store-bought ones. Seriously good. Every bite is a mix of chewy and sweet, and you can easily customize them with whatever’s hanging out in your pantry.
Some folks like to wrap them in parchment paper—so handy—to toss in backpacks or purses. Always ready when hunger strikes. Both kids and adults love them because they're just quick to grab and go. Really. These healthy snack bars give you that burst of energy just when you need it most, making them a top choice for anyone seeking a reliable snack.

People get creative with whatever dried fruit they have, like apricots, raisins, or cranberries. So much room to play with textures—some bars end up a bit more crunchy while others stay tender, but all are super satisfying.
With all those nuts and seeds, you're getting a good dose of protein to keep you feeling full. These easy snack bar recipes are perfect for kids' lunches, after-school snacks, or even a quick breakfast you can take on the go. Instead of grabbing something processed, it feels good to enjoy a bar you've made yourself, knowing it's packed with ingredients that are actually good for you. And since they're so portable, you'll always have a little pick-me-up ready for any hectic day. Overall, golden and crispy homemade snack bars keep everyone happy and fueled, whether you are at home or out and about. For sure.
To prepare the snack bars, start by toasting the unpeeled almonds. Transfer them to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and place them in a preheated static oven at 374°F for about ten minutes . Once ready, let them cool for 5-6 minutes before transferring them to a mixer
and blend them without adding anything else. Thanks to the oils contained in the almonds, you will obtain a cream . If the mixture doesn't become creamy, you can add a little vegetable oil. Pour the paste obtained into a bowl and add the rolled oats .
Add the dried cranberries, cashews , and maple syrup . Mix everything with a spatula ,
flavor with a bit of nutmeg and a pinch of cinnamon . Stir again to blend the mixture and set it aside for a moment .
Line a baking sheet (or any rectangular container) with a sheet of parchment paper and pour the mixture inside . Use a spatula to press down and level the surface
and push the mixture towards one side of the pan to compact it and obtain a thickness of about 0.4 inches . Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight, so that it solidifies sufficiently. At this point, turn the baking sheet over onto a cutting board and gently remove the parchment paper as well .
Cut the block in half lengthwise using a long, sharp knife and from each half cut out 6 rectangles . Enjoy your snack bars for a delicious snack !
Snack bars can be stored at room temperature for a couple of days. Alternatively, you can keep them in the refrigerator for 2 weeks. Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer to stack the bars to save space, separate them with a sheet of parchment paper! Instead of almonds, you can use the same amount of hazelnuts, and instead of cashews, walnuts or pistachios in the same amount! As an alternative to maple syrup, use the same amount of honey.
