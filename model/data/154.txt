instructions:
To prepare the pain perdu, first crack the eggs into a bowl, then add the soy milk , the sugar , and the cinnamon .
Also add the vanilla extract and mix with a whisk to combine the ingredients. Cut the brioche bread into fairly thick slices, about 1-1.2 inches . You should get 10 slices.
In a non-stick pan, melt the butter , then dip the slices of brioche bread into the milk and egg mixture and transfer them to the hot pan .
Cook over medium heat for 1-2 minutes per side , until golden brown and set aside. While you cook all the slices of brioche bread, focus on the sauce: in a pan, place the berries .
Add the sugar , the lemon juice , and cook over medium heat for 5-7 minutes .
For serving, pour the berry sauce into a small bowl, place it in the center of the serving plate, then arrange the slices of brioche bread in a circular pattern. Complete with maple syrup and powdered sugar . Your pain perdu is ready to be served .
The pain perdu should be enjoyed as soon as it's prepared, but if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator in a closed container for up to 1 day. When serving, we recommend warming it slightly in a pan or in the oven at a low temperature.
Instead of using brioche bread, you can use stale bread, as tradition dictates. Instead of berries, you can use strawberries, peaches, or caramelized apples. To make it even more delicious, you can accompany it with custard, chocolate ganache, or a simple crème anglaise.
