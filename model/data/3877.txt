To prepare the grilled fillet in aromatic red wine sauce, start with the meat. In a baking dish, sprinkle the fillets with olive oil and let them marinate , while you start the wine sauce. Finely chop rosemary, sage, and thyme , then clean and finely chop the shallot .
Pour all the red wine into a large pot, add the chopped shallot , cloves , juniper berries , and the chopped aromatic herbs.
Season with pepper and add bay leaves to the wine : let it simmer over high heat until it's reduced : it will take about 15 minutes.
Strain the reduction with a sieve to collect and set aside the sauce . In another pot, gently melt the butter and add the flour , whisking to eliminate all lumps.
Gradually pour in the strained wine , stirring over low heat until the mixture thickens, then keep it warm .
Now heat the grill, and when it's ready, place the fillets on it : turn them after 2-3 minutes or more depending on your taste, then salt them . Plate the meat, if you like, by laying it on a bed of salad, then drizzle it with the sauce . The grilled fillet in aromatic red wine sauce is ready.
You can store the red wine sauce for 1-2 days in the refrigerator, sealed in an airtight container. Once you add the meat, it's best to consume the dish immediately.
The fillet is a prized and expensive cut, made of a very tender muscle excellent even raw. If whole, it appears as an elongated and narrow cone, with the widest part being the leanest and most prized. It's located in a part of the loin, specifically in the lower back of the animal, and is divided into three parts: head, suitable for special steaks like the famous Chateaubriand with Béarnaise sauce ; center, suitable for medallions; and tail (for fillets or morsels). From the fillet, you can make steaks, medallions, or even prepare the "tartare", a well-known raw dish.
If you really want to elevate your palate, you should obtain Brunello di Montalcino for preparing the red wine sauce: with this excellent wine, your fillet will reach the pinnacle of taste, and your guests will be truly delighted by such goodness. You can accompany the grilled fillet with aromatic red wine sauce with grilled vegetables like zucchini, radicchio, eggplants, onions, peppers, or with boiled sugar snap peas seasoned with good extra virgin olive oil.
