Buckwheat flatbread , known as piadina di grano saraceno, is this awesome street food from the Romagna region in Italy. And look, this version adds a cool twist by using buckwheat instead of the regular white flour. It's got that darker color and, honestly, extra flavor. In Romagna, folks are really into their piadina for its simplicity and taste. And you know what? This recipe makes it perfect for sharing with friends.
Now, the chicken strips —they're marinated with a blend of aromatic herbs and spices. Super, super tasty. Every bite is tender and flavorful. The soft chew of the flatbread with the spiced chicken? Seriously good. It's a healthy flatbread recipe —a bit different but still comfy for a shared meal.
And the chips? No one's missing out on the crispy side here. And we've got baked chips instead of fried ones. They're oven-baked for that golden crunch without the grease. And listen, pair them with ketchup or a refreshing yogurt sauce. The mix of tangy and creamy flavors—just what you need when chilling with friends. Pretty simple.
The balance on the plate shows Romagna’s knack for combining flavors: the gluten-free flatbread keeps things light, while the oven-baked chicken strips are juicy and savory. These homemade chips tie everything together. I mean, it's an excellent choice for anyone wanting something new but easy. It is fun to whip out when you want to impress at dinner. With its moist chicken, crunchy chips, and a flatbread that's anything but basic. For sure.

Whether you’re looking for something special to share with family or friends, this meal will leave a lasting impression with its unique blend of ingredients and Italian charm.
To prepare the buckwheat flatbread with chicken strips and baked chips, the first thing to do is to marinate the chicken, so cut the chicken breast, removing the fattier parts and the central bone, into strips and place them in a container. Then prepare the aromatic mixture by finely chopping rosemary, marjoram, oregano, and fennel ; in a mortar, crush smoked paprika, chili powder, oregano, brown sugar, and finally salt (alternatively, you can use a mixer to reduce the spice mix to powder).
Place the chicken breast slices in a shallow and wide baking dish and sprinkle with the aromatic mixture , the spice mix , then the olive oil , and mix well to flavor the chicken breast.
Cover with plastic wrap and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4-5 hours . Then proceed to prepare the buckwheat flatbread: start by sifting the all-purpose flour into a bowl and add the baking powder for savory preparations , then add the buckwheat flour
mix and transfer the dry ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer where you will also pour the lard (if you prefer not to use it, you can replace it with the same amount of vegetable oil) , pour in the honey and run the stand mixer with the paddle attachment for 5 minutes .
When the ingredients are well combined, stop the machine and replace the paddle with the dough hook and with the stand mixer running again, incorporate the sugar , then pour in the room temperature milk ,
also add the room temperature water and finally the salt , leaving the machine running for a few minutes until the dough is ready: you can stop the stand mixer as soon as it detaches from the sides of the bowl .
After transferring the dough onto the work surface and giving it a spherical shape, place it in a clean bowl and let it rest in a glass container covered with plastic wrap for about an hour, in a turned-off oven with the light on . Meanwhile, thoroughly wash the new potatoes and cut them into thin slices and let them sit in cold water for 20 minutes to remove the starch. After the indicated time, drain them .
After drying them thoroughly with a kitchen towel, pour them into a container and season with chopped rosemary, extra virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper and mix. Pour the potato chips onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and arrange them well , let them bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 25 minutes , they should be slightly browned.
In the meantime, take the flatbread dough and divide it into 4 spheres that you'll roll out on a lightly floured work surface. Roll it out into a disc about 1/16 inch thick using a rolling pin . To get a precise shape, use a pastry cutter with a diameter of 9 inches (you can knead the leftover scraps and let them rise for half an hour to make more flatbreads). Heat a griddle or a large non-stick pan, and when it's hot, place the flatbreads one at a time, pricking them with a fork ,
a few minutes will suffice, then flip the flatbread and continue cooking on the other side . Then proceed to cook the marinated chicken: drain it from the marinade and pour it into a non-stick pan and let it cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes , stirring occasionally;
meanwhile, wash and chop the radicchio and set it aside . In a container, prepare the yogurt sauce by mixing together Greek yogurt, chopped chives, salt, and pepper and mix. Proceed to assemble the flatbreads: you can slightly warm them and place on half of each some radicchio, chicken, and yogurt sauce ,
then fold the flatbread to close it and before serving, pour the ketchup into a small bowl for each portion ; finally, serve the Buckwheat Flatbread with Chicken Strips and Baked Chips hot with the potato chips on the side!
Flatbreads dry out very quickly, so it's best to prepare and consume them immediately; they can be made a few hours in advance as long as they are covered. The filling should be prepared at the moment because the chicken becomes chewy. You can freeze the flatbreads once cooked and without filling.
The more time the chicken is left to marinate, the more succulent it will become; try letting it rest overnight, and you'll taste the difference! The flatbread calls for a quick dish that, however, requires a substantial filling to not become mundane, and above all, it must be eaten very hot to appreciate, with every bite, its wonderful flavor.
