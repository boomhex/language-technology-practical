To make the sandwich bread baskets, start with the ragù: peel the carrot, celery, and onion then chop them finely . Also chop the thyme leaves and rosemary needles . Sauté the chopped vegetables in a pan with olive oil and a clove of garlic for at least 10 minutes or until the vegetables are soft.
In the meantime, remove the casing from the sausage , then chop it or crumble it with your hands. Add the ground pork and sausage to the sauté , mix with a spoon and brown for a few moments to flavor.
Then, deglaze with white wine , season with the chopped herbs , salt, pepper, and pour in the vegetable broth , cover with the lid and continue cooking for about 30 minutes.
If necessary, add more broth. Once cooked, turn off the heat, transfer the ragù to a bowl and let it cool . Meanwhile, place the ricotta in the mixer and flavor it with nutmeg and grated lemon zest .
Blend to obtain a smooth sauce , then transfer it to a bowl and add the ragù , reserving 4 tablespoons to garnish the baskets after baking. In the meantime, take the sandwich bread, trim the edges from each slice ,
then with the help of a rolling pin, flatten the slices of sandwich bread to make them thinner , take 4 cocottes with a diameter of approximately 3.5 inches and a height of 2 inches and insert 4 slightly overlapping slices of sandwich bread into each cocotte creating a hollow inside . Fill each basket with the ricotta and ragù mixture and press it lightly with the back of a spoon.
Sprinkle the surface with grated Parmesan cheese (19-20) and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 10 minutes (or in a convection oven at 356°F for 5 minutes). Once cooked, remove the baskets from the oven and let them cool slightly.
Meanwhile, drain the sun-dried tomatoes in oil, cut them into strips . Distribute over each basket a tablespoon of ragù and finally place the sun-dried tomatoes in oil and some fresh thyme leaves on top. The filled sandwich bread baskets are ready to be enjoyed.
Store the filled sandwich bread baskets in the refrigerator for a maximum of one day; you can freeze the ragù separately.
Instead of ricotta, you can fill the baskets with other soft cheeses like robiola or goat cheese.
