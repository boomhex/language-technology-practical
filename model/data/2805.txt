instructions:
Cake pops roselline are, I gotta say, a really really good treat that absolutely stands out at any party. They’re not just cake pops; they’re like little edible rose-shaped wonders. Really. Drawing inspiration from traditional Italian baking, they use the dough from a ciambella, providing a soft and moist texture inside. And the coating? Each pop is shaped like a tiny rose and dipped in vivid, red-tinted white chocolate. Once it sets, the chocolate turns silky, offering a perfect contrast to the tender cake and sweet chocolate.

To prepare the pots, start with the cupcake batter: in a bowl, add the softened butter in pieces and sugar ; also add the eggs, a pinch of salt and beat the mixture with whisks to obtain a homogeneous cream . Then add the baking powder and the seeds from a vanilla pod .
In a small separate bowl, sift the necessary amount of corn starch, flour, and cocoa powder , add them to the cream and mix thoroughly to incorporate. Then pour the mixture into a disposable piping bag .
Take 8 round-bottom cones and fill them along the narrowest part with the mixture (7-8), so that once baked they reach the rim of the cone. Bake them in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes. Once baked, remove them from the oven and let them cool .
To prepare the roses, start with the batter: in a bowl, beat the sugar and softened butter with electric whisks until creamy, then add the seeds from 1 vanilla pod and an egg ; beat the mixture ,
then also add the sifted flour, corn starch, and baking powder; then mix everything with a hand whisk until smooth and homogeneous. Also add the zest of half a lemon. Pour the obtained batter into a disposable piping bag and pour it into the specific cakepop maker : you can cook the batter balls with the pre-set program (it will take about 3 minutes); once cooked , remove them and let them cool completely on a rack, then stick the cake pops with plastic lollipop sticks.
Meanwhile, melt the coarsely chopped white chocolate in a bain-marie , stirring with a spatula . Take the red liquid food coloring and add a few drops to the boiling liquid cream
Stir until you achieve the desired color. You can add the colored cream to the now melted white chocolate and mix. Now that the melted chocolate is colored, you can dip the cake pops for a few moments ,
then place them on a base (such as polystyrene) ; let them set in the freezer for at least 1 hour. Once they are well dried, you can decorate them with the colored chocolate left over, put in a disposable piping bag with a small hole at the tip. This way you can create concentric circles around the cake pops, getting smaller towards the top: they will simulate stylized rose petals . While these decorations also set, you can prepare the green leaves: take the sugar paste and color it with a few drops of blue food coloring
combined with yellow ; knead the sugar paste to mix the colors and achieve a bright green color . Roll out the sugar paste into a rectangle a few millimeters thick
and cut out the leaves with a specific cutter or by cutting the shape with the tip of a knife. Take the pots, plant the roses and add the green sugar paste leaves : your rose cake pops are ready to be gifted and enjoyed !
The rose cake pops can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. The pots can be stored under a glass dome for 1-2 days. You can freeze the preparations if you used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
If you prefer, you can also make the pot with white batter by increasing the amount of flour, or make the roses another color by mixing food colors!
