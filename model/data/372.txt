instructions:
To prepare the eggplant tacos, first trim the eggplant and cut it into slices about 0.4 inches thick . Heat the seed oil to a temperature of 340°F-350°F, immerse 2-3 eggplant slices at a time and fry until golden . Drain on paper towels and set aside.
Now prepare the sauce: in a small saucepan, heat a drizzle of oil with a clove of garlic , then pour in the tomato puree and salt .
Add a few basil leaves for fragrance , stir and cook over medium-low heat for 5-10 minutes . Meanwhile, slice the mozzarella, then prepare the breading by combining breadcrumbs and Parmesan in a baking dish .
Mix to combine everything , then coat the fried eggplants in the mixture, ensuring both sides are covered . Place the eggplants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and distribute a teaspoon of tomato sauce on top .
Add a slice of ham and a slice of mozzarella . Fold the eggplant in half and secure it with a toothpick .
Continue in this way to fill all the eggplants , then bake in the oven at 390°F in grill mode for 5-10 minutes. Remove from the oven, garnish with a basil leaf and serve your eggplant tacos still hot !
Eggplant tacos can be stored in the fridge for 2 days, in an airtight container.
For a lighter version, you can grill the eggplants instead of frying them!
If the mozzarella is very watery, we recommend draining the excess liquid in a colander.
