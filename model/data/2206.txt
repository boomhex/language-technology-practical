Fennel risotto is a real gem from the Veneto region. It's got this special charm—really, it does—that goes beyond your usual rice dish. You know, in places like Verona, folks call it "risi coi fenoci." It’s a favorite during those cooler autumn and winter months when tender local fennel bulbs are just perfect. What makes this fennel risotto stand out is the Vialone Nano rice. It's been grown in the Veronese rice fields since the 1500s. Yeah, that's a long time! This grain has deep roots in local culture and came about through historical trade links with Arab regions. Pretty cool, right?
Unlike the classic risotto method, you toss the veggies and aromatics in first. The rice joins later, skipping the usual toasting step. So everything blends from the start—soaking up those aromatic flavors. It’s really really comforting.
Across Veneto, this fennel risotto recipe is held in high esteem—like, you know you’re making something cherished for generations. Each spoonful feels creamy and warm, with a hint of sweetness from the fennel. And the texture? Moist from the rice cooking directly in that flavorful base. Fans of a good easy fennel risotto will love it. It's not flashy. Just simple, honest food—done right, with old-school roots.
Some versions add lemon or saffron, turning it into a fennel and lemon risotto or a fennel and saffron risotto . Both are super tasty. No question. Whichever version you try, you get that genuine Veneto flavor. It’s the kind of meal that brings folks together. And look, there's a story in every bite and a golden, homey look that really invites everyone in. If you love a good Italian risotto , or want something with real regional flair, this dish is perfect for a cool night. Seriously, it offers warmth and connection around the table. Pretty much a must-try.
To prepare fennel risotto, first prepare the Vegetable broth and keep it warm. Then, proceed by cleaning the onion and finely chopping it . Clean the fennel by removing the base, stalks , and outer layers if they are damaged: you should obtain 320 g of fennel which you will need for the recipe. Wash them, cut them in half, and slice thinly .
Next, place the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat ; once the butter has melted, add the chopped onion and let it brown, still on low heat, for a few minutes to soften it without coloring.
Now add the thinly sliced fennel , slightly increase the heat and let the fennel absorb flavors for about 5 minutes, stirring to ensure even cooking. Add the rice and, while stirring, let it absorb flavors for 3-4 minutes .
Before adding the first ladle of broth . As the broth is absorbed, add more, continuing in this way until the rice is cooked (the time may vary depending on the rice used, but it will take about 15-20 minutes). During the last minutes of cooking, adjust the salt and pepper . When the rice reaches the right degree of cooking, turn off the heat and cream with 30 g of butter .
And flavor with cheese . Mix carefully and let it thicken for 1 minute before plating: your fennel risotto...pardon, risi coi fenoci is served !
Like all risottos, this risotto retains its consistency if enjoyed immediately after preparation. However, it can be stored in the fridge for 1-2 days, in an airtight container.
The version we've proposed is entirely vegetarian, with vegetable broth. But many traditional recipes use a good Beef Broth to cook the risotto instead: the choice is yours! Deviating slightly from tradition, you can enrich your risotto with crispy strips of pancetta or speck: delicious!
