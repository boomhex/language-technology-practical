instructions:
To prepare the meatball sub sandwiches, start by making the dough: place the all-purpose flour in a bowl, add the durum wheat flour and the yeast , pour in a bit of warm water to start kneading , continue by gradually adding more water while mixing the dough with your other hand,
when the dough is well combined, knead it for a few minutes . At this point, add the salt and the remaining water, being sure to pour it in gradually. The dough will be very soft, but easy to work with. When it is perfectly combined and smooth, lightly flour it .
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap , let the dough rise at room temperature and away from drafts for about 8-10 hours or until it doubles in size. The times may vary depending on the season. Once the rising is complete, flip your dough onto a well-floured work surface with durum wheat flour , spread it out with your hands into a rectangle about 8 x 12 inches. It doesn't need to be precise because the dough is very hydrated .
Generously flour the surface of the dough using the durum wheat flour again and start cutting 4 breadsticks with the help of a dough scraper , gently place them on one or more baking trays lined with parchment paper. Dust the breadsticks with the durum wheat flour , cover the tray with a kitchen towel, and let them rise for about another hour. Move on to the preparation of the meatballs: in a bowl, add the ground meat, eggs , and mix with a fork to combine.
Season the mixture with salt , chopped garlic , and chopped parsley .
Finally, add grated Grana Padano DOP and breadcrumbs , and mix again to obtain a homogeneous and compact mixture. Now you can form the meatballs: take handfuls of about 1.4 oz of mixture and create balls, placing them on a tray . You should obtain about 14 meatballs.
Peel and finely chop the onion , pour the oil into a non-stick pan, add the onion and brown over low heat for a few minutes, add the tomato sauce ,
season with salt, flavor with basil , and continue cooking over low heat. When the sauce comes to a boil, place the meatballs inside , cover with a lid , and continue cooking for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
When cooking is complete, turn off the heat and keep warm . Preheat the oven to 430°F (in fan mode) and bake the breadsticks on the second lowest rack, cooking for about 10-12 minutes, the cooking time may vary depending on the oven, assess the desired browning .
Cut the breadsticks in half , fill with the sauce and meatballs , add a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese and a few basil leaves , close the meatball sandwiches and serve immediately .
You can store the meatballs in the refrigerator for up to two days, while the bread can be stored in special bags for two days at room temperature or frozen and thawed as needed.
If you want even more delicious sandwiches, you can add a few slices of your favorite cheese at the bottom so the cheese melts on contact with the hot meatballs!
