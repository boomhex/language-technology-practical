Cocoa almond ring cake is the kind of treat that just brings everyone together. Really, it does. Especially in Italian homes where simple sweets are, like, a big part of family life. In the North and Central regions of Italy, folks have all sorts of ways to make their own ciambella, but the mix of chocolate almond bundt cake with a tender crumb and a hit of rich cocoa is really really special. The almond flour gives this cake a moist texture that holds up well. Seriously good. And every bite is a little softer than your usual breakfast cake. And the aroma? When that golden ring comes out of the oven, the whole house smells warm and inviting—like you’re about to sit down for a cozy snack. Pretty much.
It’s the kind of thing that works just as well for easy chocolate almond cake recipe ideas for a weekend breakfast as it does for a laid-back family gathering. The flavors are just perfect for making everyone feel at home. A quick berry sauce adds a tangy twist to the deep flavors of the cocoa almond ring cake . Italians often love pairing their ciambella with a fruit topping—sometimes it’s classic cherries or a homemade strawberry jam, but here, the blend of berries makes everything sweeter and gives the cake a little extra pop. And look, people in Italy usually keep it simple and let the homemade berry sauce be the star, spooning it over a slice so the juicy fruit seeps into the crumb.
The way the rich chocolate and toasted almonds mix with the sharp taste of berries is just plain delicious. It’s one of those combinations that feels both homey and a bit fancy at the same time. Whether you’re picking at a slice during a lazy weekend or passing around plates at an afternoon get-together, this moist bundt cake with almonds and its fruity topping brings out smiles all around. There’s just something about that Italian ciambella style. For sure. Especially with a twist like this, it makes people want to slow down and enjoy the moment. It’s all about taking a break to savor the little things in life. Cannot go wrong.

To prepare the cocoa and almond ring cake with red fruit sauce, start with the batter. In a bowl, mix the two flours with the cocoa and the packet of baking powder . Separately, in another bowl, pour the eggs and brown sugar . Beat the ingredients with an electric mixer until the eggs are fluffy and light. It will take about 5 minutes.
With the mixer still running, add the oil in a stream and once it's well absorbed, add the milk . Now reduce the speed of the beaters and also add the sifted dry ingredients directly into the bowl .
Once the batter is ready, take a large 9-10 inch ring cake mold, butter it, and dust it with cocoa . Transfer the batter inside and level it with a spatula. Bake in a preheated static oven at 320°F for 45 minutes. Always perform the toothpick test before removing the cake from the oven, and then let it cool. At this point, prepare the sauce.
