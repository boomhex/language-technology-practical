So, these stuffed cabbage rolls? They're getting a northern Italian twist, swapping the usual tomato stuff for a rich risotto tucked inside tender cabbage leaves. Really cool, right? In Lombardy and the Aosta Valley , it's like the perfect winter comfort food with a twist. Instead of going for ground meat and tomato sauce, this cabbage rolls recipe wraps blanched savoy cabbage (verza) leaves around a creamy, aromatic risotto. And listen, the filling's got sausage, cubes of Fontina cheese, and a hint of rosemary for those cozy winter vibes.
The cabbage leaves? Just blanched enough to be pliable but still with some bite. Seriously good. You get that awesome contrast between the soft filling and the sturdy outside. It's a pretty cool move to turn a classic second course into a first course that feels really special without being too fussy. And on the table, these rice stuffed cabbage bundles look like little gifts. So cute, especially with a Fontina cheese fondue that melts into a gooey, rich sauce.

To prepare the rolls, first deal with the sausage. Score the casing and gently remove it . Then roughly crumble the sausage with your hands . Prepare the meat broth and keep it warm. Transfer the pieces of sausage to a saucepan ,
and cook over high heat for about 3 minutes . Add the rice and let it toast for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally. Wet the rice with two or three ladles of hot broth to cover it, and stir again.
Cook the rice for about 25 minutes, continuing to add broth when necessary . Halfway through the cooking, chop 1 sprig of rosemary and add it to the risotto .
Continue cooking, adding more broth as needed and stirring occasionally to prevent sticking . As soon as the rice is cooked, turn off the heat , add the Parmesan cheese
and mix it in until you get a creamy risotto . Transfer the risotto to a tray , spread it out to cover the entire surface, cover with plastic wrap , and place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
In the meantime, choose 12 large and intact Savoy cabbage leaves . Remove the fibrous central part if necessary, taking care not to break the leaf . Blanch the Savoy cabbage leaves in plenty of hot water for about a minute.
Drain them with tongs and transfer to a tray with a kitchen towel. Spread the first Savoy cabbage leaf, place a handful of now-cool risotto in the center of the leaf . Fold the leaf over from both ends to cover the rice .
Then lift the lower part and flip it over . Use a toothpick to secure it all and repeat the same operation on the other side to form a bundle.
Repeat the same operation for the others . Pour the oil, butter, and a sprig of rosemary into a large pan . When the butter is completely melted, add the Savoy cabbage rolls .
Try not to overlap them, then cook over high heat for about 3 minutes. Salt and pepper , turn the rolls, and cook for another 3 minutes . Then turn off the heat and keep them warm. Now, move on to the fondue. Grate the Fontina cheese ,
add it to a small saucepan and add the fresh cream . Cook everything for about 3 minutes until the cheese is melted, always stirring until you get a smooth cream . Now everything is ready, just serve the warm rolls with the hot Fontina fondue !
The Savoy cabbage rolls stuffed with rice can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
It's possible to add a cube of cheese to the center of each roll.
