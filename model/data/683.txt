instructions:
To prepare the broccoli and ricotta parcels, start by cleaning the broccoli. Cut them into small florets , which will weigh about 150 grams in total. Now move on to the potatoes: peel them and cut them into 1-2 cm (about 0.5-0.75 inch) cubes . Immerse broccoli and potatoes in lightly salted boiling water and cook for about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, take the sausage, remove the casing, and cut it into pieces . When the broccoli and potatoes are soft, drain them well in a bowl and mash them with a fork .
You should obtain a homogeneous puree . At this point, pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, a sprig of rosemary, and a clove of garlic . Add the sausage and let it brown until it is well golden. Then remove the aromas .
Add the broccoli and potato puree and cook for a few more moments . Turn off the heat, transfer to a bowl, and let cool. As soon as the mixture is lukewarm, add the ricotta .
Season with nutmeg , salt, and pepper. Mix well until you obtain a homogeneous mixture . Unroll the puff pastry roll and, placing the long side towards you, cut out 4 rectangles of the same width .
Fill them halfway, placing the filling in the center and leaving 1 cm (about 0.5 inch) from the edges and then fold the pastry to cover the filling . Pinch first with your fingers and then with a fork, to seal the edges well .
Score the surface, creating 3 V-shaped cuts and transfer onto a baking tray with parchment paper. Brush the surface with the egg yolk and bake in a static oven, preheated to 392°F (200°C), for about 20/25 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve your parcels still hot !
We recommend consuming the parcels within a few hours. Alternatively, you can store them in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
In both cases, we recommend lightly reheating them before serving!
Instead of sausage, you can use bacon or anchovies in oil!
