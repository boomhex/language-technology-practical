This tabbouleh rice salad is like a mash-up of traditional Middle Eastern flavors with a bit of a modern twist. I mean, originally, tabbouleh's made with bulgur, but here, fluffy rice takes the stage. Really gives it a lighter, yet equally fresh vibe, you know? So here's the thing, the whole salad is tossed with this lemon citronette. Adds a zesty burst that really really wakes up the flavors. You'll find chopped tomatoes and cucumbers giving it a juicy crunch, sticking true to the OG recipe. Plus, to give it a creative flair, toasted almonds and a dollop of plain yogurt are added on top. And the texture? It's creamy and extra crunchy—which is awesome—complementing everything else beautifully.
When the heat's on, a Mediterranean rice salad like this is perfect. Cool, light, and bursting with herby flavors. This rice tabbouleh recipe hangs onto all those classic Middle Eastern bits: loads of parsley, fresh mint, and, oh yeah, plenty of lemon. And look, what makes it special is how flexible it is. Like, feel free to toss in extra veggies, swap out the nuts, or go for brown rice for an even more healthy rice salad option. The combo of yogurt and almonds? Really adds a little something extra, elevating it beyond just another parsley rice salad. The tangy lemon dressing keeps it lively—seriously good—even if you make it ahead and let it chill.
It's a hit at barbecues or as a light lunch on its own. No question. No matter how you serve it, this crisp and cool dish offers a Middle Eastern rice salad experience.
