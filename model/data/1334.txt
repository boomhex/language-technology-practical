instructions:
To prepare the tuna belly cutlets, first cut the belly into fillets and, if it's too thick, butterfly it : you should obtain 4 pieces with a thickness of 0.6 inches .
In a container, pour the breadcrumbs, the chopped parsley , the crushed dried chilies , and the fennel seeds .
Add also the grated lemon zest , the grated garlic clove , and the salt . Mix well and set aside.
In another container, combine the oil, the lemon juice and emulsify with a fork. At this point, start the breading: dip the cutlets first in the oil and lemon emulsion and then in the breadcrumbs .
Repeat the operation by dipping the cutlets again in the emulsion and covering them a second time with the breadcrumb mixture to get an even breading . Transfer the cutlets to a tray lined with parchment paper and continue with the rest of the pieces.
Place the cutlets on a preheated grill and cook over medium heat for about 4 minutes on each side, or until a nice golden crust has formed. To brown them faster, you can add a drizzle of oil during cooking on both sides . Once cooked, add a pinch of coarse salt on top and serve your tuna belly cutlets immediately !
It is recommended to consume the tuna belly cutlets immediately after preparation.
If you wish, you can further enrich the breading by adding grated Pecorino cheese to the breadcrumb mix!
