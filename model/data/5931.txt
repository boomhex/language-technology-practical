instructions:
To prepare homemade cooking cream , pour the milk into a wide saucepan . Bring to the boil . Stir with a whisk as soon as it starts to boil .
Cook for around 20 minutes on a medium to high flame, stirring occasionally. Don't worry about the lumps that will form . Reduce the milk until it thickens and turns ivory in color. Your cream will be ready when you will have reduced it enough, so that it weighs 5.25 oz. Place it in a bowl and blend with an immersion mixer until smooth.
Pour into a colander over a bowl to filter it. Using a spatula will help . Your homemade cooking cream is ready : you can use it right away or cover with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator until needed.
Your homemade cooking cream can be stored in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to 2 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
Using a very wide saucepan will help shorten the time it takes for the water to evaporate from the milk; cooking times for this recipe are based on a 10.2" diameter saucepan.
We recommend using a saucepan that isn't too small, otherwise the milk will boil over.
