instructions:
To prepare the lemon potatoes , start by peeling the potatoes . Cut them into 8 wedges and gradually transfer them to a bowl with cold water . Leave them soaking just long enough to prepare the marinade.
In a bowl, combine the juice of two lemons , oil and a pinch of salt .
Emulsify with a whisk , then drain the potatoes and add them to the bowl. Mix well and leave to absorb the flavor for about 30 minutes. After this time, transfer them to a baking tray, together with their marinade .
Add the rosemary and thyme . Bake in a preheated conventional oven at 445 ° F (230°C) for 40 minutes. Then activate the convection mode, lower the temperature to 410 ° F (210°C) and continue cooking for another 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve your lemon potatoes .
We recommend eating lemon potatoes right away. Alternatively, you can keep them in the fridge for a day and reheat them before serving.
Do not worry if the potatoes take a long time to cook. Since they are covered by the marinade it is normal for them to struggle to turn golden brown. Slightly adjust the cooking times to your oven, until the potatoes turn golden brown!
