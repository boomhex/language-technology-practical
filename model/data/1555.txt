instructions:
To prepare farfalle with carrot pesto, first bring a pot of salted water to a boil, which will be used to cook the pasta. Peel the carrots, rinse them and cut them into chunks . Transfer the carrots into a mixer and add the walnut kernels, keeping a few aside for garnish . Blend to reduce everything to a puree, then add the salt
and the grated Grana Padano PDO cheese . Continue blending, gradually adding the oil until you obtain a cream with a homogeneous consistency .
When the water comes to a boil, add the farfalle and cook them al dente . Drain the pasta, keeping some of the cooking water aside, and transfer it to a bowl, then add the carrot pesto and mix carefully. Pour a ladle of the reserved cooking water to make the sauce even creamier .
Mix well to blend everything together , then garnish each plate with the coarsely chopped walnut kernels : your farfalle with carrot pesto is ready to be enjoyed !
Carrot pesto can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. If you wish, it can be frozen in small jars.
You can make the farfalle with carrot pesto even creamier by adding some fresh cheese or pieces of sweet gorgonzola at the end!
