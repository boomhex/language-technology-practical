To prepare the baked oysters with mushrooms, you need to open the oysters: For lemon and pepper oysters, make sure the oyster shells are closed , then open the oysters, which is a very delicate operation. Use the special knife with a thin tip, with finger protection, and a firm grip. Hold the oyster securely with one hand and with the other, grip the knife and look for the opening (you can request pre-drilled oysters at the fish market for easier opening). Insert the blade and cut the muscle located in the center ; once it's cut, it will be easier to follow the circumference to open the oyster entirely .
Open the oysters and collect their liquid in a small bowl , then strain it through a sieve and detach the oyster from the shell. Brush half of the shells because they will be used to hold the oysters and the breadcrumb topping. Now focus on the breadcrumb topping: clean the champignon mushrooms
and chop them , peel the shallot and chop it . In a pan, melt the butter and olive oil over low heat ,
add the chopped shallot and let it soften for 10 minutes, adding a little warm water , then add the champignon mushrooms ,
Flavor with the oyster liquid and cook for about 10 minutes, turn off the heat, and season with chopped parsley . Also chop the bread crumb
and place it in a bowl, add the sautéed mushrooms , and mix the breadcrumb topping . Take the cleaned shells, insert the mollusk in each, and cover with the mushroom breadcrumb topping .
Place the shells on a baking tray and grill in the oven for 5 minutes until the breadcrumb topping is crispy and golden . Remove the baked oysters with mushrooms from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving .
It is recommended to consume the baked oysters with mushrooms immediately. You can prepare the breadcrumb topping in advance and store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
For an aromatic touch, deglaze the mushrooms with white wine, which will make the breadcrumb topping even more flavorful.
Oysters are typically eaten raw, either plain or with a squeeze of lemon or flavored vinegar and a grind of pepper. If you decide to cook them, you can prepare them with a delicate broth for soups, or bake them in their own shells; the cooking process must be very quick, and you should watch the edges of the mollusk: when they start to curl, they are ready.
