instructions:
To prepare the fish sticks, cut the cod into chunks and place it in a food processor with blades along with the flour . Blend until the cod detaches from the sides .
Transfer it to a bowl and season with salt , lemon zest , and finely chopped parsley . Mix to combine.
Take about 2 oz (56 g) of the mixture and work it with wet hands to form a flat stick . Place the sticks on a tray lined with parchment paper .
Pass each stick through beaten eggs with salt and pepper and then in breadcrumbs , repeat this process twice for a crunchier coating .
Heat the oil to 329°F (165°C), fry a maximum of two sticks at a time for about 2 minutes, until they are nicely golden . Drain the fish sticks on paper towels and serve them hot .
Consume the fish sticks immediately. You can freeze them before cooking if you have used fresh ingredients.
Serve the sticks with lemon mayonnaise, perhaps flavored with drops of Tabasco.
