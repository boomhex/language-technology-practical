instructions:
To prepare the pork rib sauce, start by cleaning and thinly slicing the onion , then cut the chili pepper in half .
Crush a clove of garlic , then take care of the ribs: sprinkle them with salt and massage to flavor the meat evenly. In a large pot, heat the oil over high heat and add the ribs .
Brown well for 2-3 minutes on each side . Once golden, remove the ribs from the pot and set them aside . Lower the heat and add the chili pepper, garlic, and onion to the same pot .
Add the rosemary and sage and let them infuse for about 5 minutes before adding the browned ribs . Turn up the heat a bit, stirring often, and deglaze with white wine .
Let the alcohol evaporate completely , then pour in the tomato puree and season with salt and pepper .
Cover with the lid and cook on low heat for about 2 hours, stirring occasionally . At the end of cooking, the meat should be so tender it falls apart and the sauce should be nice and thick. Your pork rib sauce is ready to be enjoyed as you like !
The pork rib sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4-5 days in an airtight container.
You can also freeze it.
Try deglazing the ribs with port wine to accentuate the aromatic note!
