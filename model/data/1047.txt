instructions:
To make the choripan, first prepare the Chimichurri : pour the dried thyme into a bowl , along with the dried oregano and the crushed chili pepper .
Add the ground cumin , black pepper , and crushed garlic cloves .
Also add the parsley leaves that have been washed and dried previously , salt , and vinegar .
Finally, pour in the water and extra virgin olive oil , mix well , and let it rest at room temperature for at least an hour.
After the resting time, proceed to cook the chorizo: heat a large pan well and brown the sausages over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes , turning them often to prevent burning . Cover with a lid and cook for another 5 minutes until well browned .
At this point, slice the bread lengthwise without completely separating the two halves . Add the chorizo inside and cover it with plenty of chimichurri sauce . Your choripan is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the choripan immediately. The chimichurri can be stored in an airtight jar in the refrigerator for about 3-4 days, adding more oil if necessary to keep it completely covered.
The Argentine choripan is filled exclusively with chorizo and chimichurri, but if you prefer, you can enrich it by adding caramelized red onions or vine tomatoes!
