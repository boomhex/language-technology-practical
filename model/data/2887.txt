Strudel di pane ripieno di salsiccia e teglia di funghi saporiti is just the kind of dish you stumble upon when exploring Northern Italy, especially in spots like Lombardy and Trentino-Alto Adige. And here's the thing, what makes this dish special is the tender leavened dough. It wraps around a filling of sausage stuffed bread strudel featuring luganega sausage. This isn’t just any sausage—it’s a Northern Italian favorite, mild and a bit moist, with a flavor that really really shines after it’s sautéed and finished off with a splash of red wine. Everything gets rolled up so every slice is super savory and brings that classic Italian warmth. And the sauce? Alongside the strudel, there’s a savory mushroom bake loaded with layers of golden breadcrumbs, melted cheese, and earthy mushrooms mixed with herbs. People in these regions really love using what’s local and seasonal, so the mushrooms taste like a walk through an Alpine forest—with a crunchy crust and a cheesy finish that makes the whole thing feel extra homey.
When you want something more exciting than plain bread or regular sausage rolls, this sausage and mushroom strudel really fits the bill. It’s the kind of dish you might see on the table for a big Sunday dinner or cut into pieces for aperitivo with friends. And you know what? The crispy crust from the bread dough holds in all those juicy flavors, while the red wine in the filling adds a tangy depth—way way different from other sausage pastries you might know. And listen, the mushroom side dish is kinda like a homemade casserole, but the Italian way—simple, rustic, and full of flavor from good olive oil and grated cheese. If you’re into easy comfort food, this easy sausage strudel recipe always hits the spot, whether you’re feeding a crowd or just craving something hearty. Each bite gives you the best of both worlds: rich, meaty sausage and earthy mushrooms, all tucked into a crust that’s just the right mix of chewy and golden. It’s a little taste of the mountains, right at your table, which is great.
To prepare the bread strudel stuffed with sausage, start with the dough: place the sifted flour in a bowl (as an alternative to manitoba flour, you can use all-purpose flour). Then divide the water dose and dissolve the yeast in half . Add the teaspoon of malt (or sugar) and mix to combine the ingredients. In the other half of the water dissolve the salt .
Then add the yeast and malt dissolved in water to the bowl with the flour , then also pour in the water in which you dissolved the salt . Add the olive oil last .
Then begin kneading in the bowl , transfer the dough to a floured surface and work the dough until it is smooth and elastic. Then place it in a bowl and cover it with microwave-safe plastic wrap, then put the bowl in the Samsung Smart Oven and set the automatic leavening program 1-3 (max weight 900 g), the dough will double in volume .
While the dough is rising, prepare the filling: in a large pan, sauté the minced garlic with the oil . Meanwhile, remove the casing from the sausage , then add the meat pieces to the pan and cook by adding wild fennel and deglazing with red wine. Salt and pepper to taste and cook for about 10 minutes.
Once the leavening program is complete, take the dough and roll it out on a floured work surface giving it an oval shape; then pour over the white sausage ragout leaving a couple of centimeters from the edge and sprinkle with grated cheese . Start rolling the strudel from the smaller side .
When you have finished, cut the ends and seal the strudel well; with the discarded ends create small rolls of dough to decorate the bread strudel (16-17). At this point, bake in the microwave by setting the convection cooking program as if it were a normal oven: bake at 350°F for about 30 minutes. Then remove the strudel and cut it into slices to serve!
To prepare the flavorful mushroom pan, start with the herb chopping which will be used to season them: chop the parsley , chives, oregano, and garlic clove. Then in a small bowl pour a drizzle of oil , add the chopped herbs, and salt and pepper to taste.
Grease a 10-inch diameter baking dish with a drizzle of oil and sprinkle with breadcrumbs. Then move on to cleaning the champignon mushrooms (you can also consult the Cooking School: cleaning of champignon mushrooms). Cut the mushroom roots, then rub them with a clean cloth to remove the soil; then cut them into fairly thin slices .
Then place them in the baking dish creating a first layer, sprinkle with the chopped herbs and continue with another layer of mushrooms. Finish with grated cheese and breadcrumbs. Then cook in the Samsung Smart Oven at maximum power setting the cooking time to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve the flavorful mushroom pan hot or warm!
You can store the bread strudel stuffed with sausage in an airtight container or a freezer bag for about 2 days. You can store the flavorful mushroom pan in the refrigerator for 1-2 days at most, covered with plastic wrap. Freezing is not recommended.
You can enrich the bread strudel with sausage, for example by also adding guanciale or pancetta sautéed in a pan. You can also use other types of mushrooms if you prefer.
