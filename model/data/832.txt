Chicken bombette with cacio e pepe is like a little journey from Southern Italy to Rome—all on one plate! In Puglia , folks really love their tender bombette di carne, usually made with veal and filled with caciocavallo cheese. But here, it’s all about chicken bombette , so it's lighter but still super flavorful. And look, instead of plain breadcrumbs, these are coated in crushed taralli, a crispy snack everyone loves. Adds a nice crunch, you know? And here's the thing: the creamy cacio e pepe sauce on the side is inspired by Rome’s pasta traditions. It’s got sharp Pecorino Romano and a punch of black pepper, so every bite of this Italian stuffed chicken is way way flavorful. Across Italy, there are all kinds of rolled meat dishes, but nothing quite like this mix. The moist chicken and tangy cheese sauce—seriously good combo. It’s the kind of dish that works on a weeknight or when you’ve got friends over. Some families in Puglia stick to their old-school bombette, while Romans love their golden pasta, but this fusion gives you the best of both. With the salty pop of cacio e pepe and the soft inside of the chicken, it’s no wonder chicken recipes like this get people talking. Every bite feels like a taste of both regions, and the crushed taralli—well, it takes you right to those Apulian evenings. Pretty amazing, right? It's a fantastic pick for anyone wanting a fresh spin on Italian chicken dishes without missing those authentic flavors. Whether you’re sharing it with family or friends, this dish brings something unique and memorable to the table. For sure.

To prepare the chicken bombs with cheese and pepper, start by grating the Pecorino . Now coarsely crush the taralli with a meat tenderizer to break them into crumbs and set them aside .
Take a slice of chicken, season with salt and pepper on both sides . Stuff the center with about 0.18 oz of Pecorino and a sprinkle of oregano .
Fold the sides inward and wrap the slice to create the roll . With these quantities, you will make 12. Roll the rolls in the crumbled taralli .
Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, sprinkle with pepper and drizzle with oil . Bake in a preheated ventilated oven at 392°F for about 20 minutes, turning the bombs halfway through cooking. While the bombs are in the oven, prepare the sauce: in a small saucepan, toast some pre-ground black pepper for a few minutes, once toasted, pour in the water and turn off the heat .
Pour the grated Pecorino into a jug and add the now lukewarm water , blend with an immersion mixer to obtain a smooth sauce .
Once the chicken bombs with cheese and pepper are cooked , remove them from the oven and serve them hot with the Pecorino sauce .
We recommend consuming the cheese and pepper bombs immediately. If any are left over, store them in the fridge for a maximum of a couple of days.
You can use breadcrumbs scented with spices like paprika, or even chopped herbs like rosemary, oregano, and sage in place of taralli.
For perfect cooking, use very thin slices or possibly thin them with a meat tenderizer.
