instructions:
To prepare homemade macaroni, start by combining semolina flour, water , and salt in a bowl. Begin kneading by hand until the dough is compact ,
then transfer it to your work surface and continue kneading by hand . Shape it into a dough ball , cover it with plastic wrap , and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
After the necessary time has passed, take the dough ball. Take a piece of dough and roll it into rods about the thickness of your pinky finger (approximately 1/5 in) , rolling with your hands on the work surface .
Cut small pieces with a dough cutter, approximately 1.5 inches . Wrap a piece around the specific iron (or if you don't have it, you can use a skewer) . Once wrapped, gently roll it with both hands to extend it .
Slide it off and you'll have the macaroni . Place the pasta on a tray lined with a lightly floured cloth . Your macaroni is ready to be cooked in salted boiling water.
We recommend consuming fresh pasta immediately. If you want to dry it, you can store it in a bag at room temperature in a dry place. Alternatively, you can freeze it this way: place the tray in the freezer and wait for the macaroni to harden a little, then store them in a freezer bag for convenience. It is not recommended to store raw pasta in the fridge as it may absorb moisture.
If you don't have the typical iron, you can use wooden skewers. Dress your macaroni with a fresh tomato sauce or a good meat ragù!
