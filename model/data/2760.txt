To prepare fusilli with bell pepper pesto, start by baking the bell peppers in the oven to make removing the skin easier: place the whole washed red bell peppers on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper; cook them at 428°F for 20-25 minutes. Once cooked , place them in a food bag for at least 15 minutes, then peel them
cut them in half, remove the internal seeds, and slice them roughly . Put the pepper pieces in a mixer , then add the pine nuts
and the basil leaves ; add half a clove of peeled garlic , the peeled almonds
and the grated Parmesan cheese . Add the oil and blend everything until you get a homogeneous mixture ; set the obtained pesto aside.
Bring plenty of water to a boil, salt it, boil the fusilli for the time indicated on the package , then drain the pasta and mix it with the bell pepper pesto: the fusilli with bell pepper pesto are ready to be enjoyed . If you prefer, you can season with Grana flakes.
You can store the fusilli with bell pepper pesto in an airtight container for up to 1 day. The bell pepper pesto can be stored in the refrigerator in a jar or covered with plastic wrap for 1-2 days. It can be frozen in small glass containers.
