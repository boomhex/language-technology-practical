instructions:
To prepare the Mediterranean chicken thighs, season the chicken drumsticks in a bowl with oil, salt, and pepper . Set aside and prepare the sauté. Slice the garlic and cut the onion into thin strips .
Cook the chicken in a pan for 6 minutes on one side and another 6 minutes on the other , until it has a nice crust. Deglaze with white wine and, once the alcohol has evaporated, remove the well-browned chicken thighs from the pan, letting them rest on a baking tray or plate.
Pit most of the olives , cut the chili and remove the seeds , then slice it thinly .

In the same pan where you cooked the chicken, add the garlic , capers , and Gaeta olives .
The baked black olives , Greek olives , and onions .

Sauté for two minutes and deglaze the bottom with water . Pour in the tomato passata , and add the reserved chicken thighs .

Season with salt, and when it reaches a boil, cover with a lid , lower the heat, and let it cook for another 30 minutes. Once cooked, flavor with dried oregano . Serve the Mediterranean chicken thighs hot .
Mediterranean chicken thighs can be stored in the fridge for one day. Freezing is not recommended.
To ensure a nice golden crust forms, brown the chicken thighs without stirring them.
