instructions:
To prepare the leek and sausage risotto, first make the Vegetable broth following our recipe and keep it warm. Remove the green part of the leeks and slice them into thin rounds . Remove the casing from the sausage and crumble it with your hands .
In a large saucepan, melt the butter , then add the sausage and brown it for a few minutes over high heat, stirring frequently .
When it is nicely golden, add the leeks and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes , until they have softened. At this point, add the rice to the saucepan and toast it for a couple of minutes, stirring well to combine it with the rest of the ingredients.
Season with salt and deglaze with white wine , then let the alcohol evaporate completely. Now start adding the broth, one ladle at a time , always waiting for it to be absorbed before adding more. Continue in this way for about 15-18 minutes, until the rice is cooked.
Once cooked, turn off the heat and cream with mascarpone , butter , and grated Parmigiano Reggiano .
Cover with the lid and let it rest for a couple of minutes before stirring vigorously to combine everything . Finally, adjust the salt and pepper. Your leek and sausage risotto is ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the leek and sausage risotto immediately. If necessary, you can store it in the refrigerator for one day.
For a more intense flavor, you can use beef broth instead of vegetable broth, and deglaze with red wine instead of white wine.
