instructions:
To prepare the eggless yogurt cake, pour the flour, baking powder, and sugar into a bowl and mix with a fork. Add the sunflower oil and lemon yogurt .
Work the ingredients until you get a fairly homogeneous and smooth dough . Incorporate the milk into the rest of the ingredients .
The batter, once worked, should look like a velvety cream . Grease and flour a 9-inch (22 cm) springform pan. Pour and level the batter . Bake in a preheated fan oven at 350°F for 35 minutes, using a toothpick test to check if it's done. If it comes out dry, the cake is ready. Let it cool completely before removing it from the mold and slicing .
The eggless yogurt cake keeps well covered, at room temperature for up to three days.
Dust the surface of the cake, once cooled, with vanilla-flavored powdered sugar.
