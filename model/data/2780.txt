To prepare the coconut and Nutella cake, start by rehydrating the coconut, placing it in a small bowl with 3/4 cup milk ; stir and let it fully absorb the liquids. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer, place the softened butter and sugar (you can also use an electric mixer).
Begin to work the mixture with the whisks to obtain a smooth cream ; then add the eggs, one at a time, waiting for each to be incorporated before adding the next and continue to run the mixer. Meanwhile, sift the flour with the baking powder and baking soda .
Add a pinch of salt then mix the dry ingredients before gradually adding them to the mixer . Once fully incorporated, add the rehydrated coconut ;
finally, add the remaining 1/3 cup milk and continue mixing until you have a smooth and thick cream. Butter and line a 9.5-inch cake pan with parchment paper and pour the batter inside : level it with the back of a spoon and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 60 minutes (or in a convection oven at 320°F for about 50 minutes). If the surface darkens too much, after 30 minutes of baking, you can cover the cake with aluminum foil and continue baking.
Once baked, take the cake out of the oven and let it cool slightly. Then, unmold it and let it cool completely on a wire rack. When it's completely cool, you can cut the cake in half (14-15)
and fill it with approximately 1 1/4 cups of Nutella . Then cover with the other half of the cake and use the remaining Nutella to coat the outside of the cake, including the top
and the entire perimeter, using a spatula to spread it evenly . Take a sheet of paper, draw a circle the same diameter as the cake, and cut out the word "Coconut" in the center . Then slice fresh coconut thinly .
Now you can decorate the cake: without placing the cut-out on the cake, use the paper template to sprinkle desiccated coconut on the surface and thereby create the "Coconut" word on the cake . You can add two coffee beans or two chocolate pralines to highlight the "o"s in the word . Decorate the perimeter of the cake with coconut slices (or you can decorate with desiccated coconut). Your coconut and Nutella cake is ready to be enjoyed!
Store the coconut and Nutella cake in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. When serving, you can take it out of the fridge 15-20 minutes beforehand so the Nutella softens at room temperature. You can freeze the cake in slices and thaw the required portions as needed.
For an even richer batter, how about adding chocolate chips? You can lightly flour them and place them in the refrigerator during preparation, then add them as the last ingredient before putting the batter in the cake pan!
