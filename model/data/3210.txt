instructions:
To prepare the mandarin plumcake, start by grating the zest of the citrus fruits, which you will set aside for a moment . Then squeeze the juice and weigh 60 g (about 1/4 cup) to use for the batter .
Take care of the dry ingredients: in a bowl, combine the cornstarch with the flour and sift in the baking powder . Mix and set aside .
In a large bowl, pour in the eggs, sugar , vanilla extract , and grated mandarin zest .
Work with the electric mixer for 5 minutes , then gradually add the oil in a slow stream and continue to mix until fully incorporated. Then, gradually add the dry ingredients .
Alternate adding the dry ingredients with the mandarin juice, keeping the mixer running . Once all ingredients are incorporated, pour the batter into a 11x4 inch loaf pan, 3 inches high, which you previously greased with vegetable oil . Using an oiled spatula, make a lengthwise cut down the center of the batter : this will help form the split during baking.
Bake the mandarin plumcake in a static oven at 350°F for 45 minutes, being sure to perform a toothpick test towards the end . Let it cool slightly before unmolding and dusting with powdered sugar . Your mandarin plumcake is ready to be enjoyed as a snack or breakfast !
The mandarin plumcake keeps well under a glass dome or wrapped in plastic wrap for 2-3 days.
It can be frozen for about a month.
If you want to make your mandarin plumcake even more delicious, you can glaze it: just mix a bit of mandarin juice with a generous amount of powdered sugar and pour the glaze over the unmolded and cooled cake!
