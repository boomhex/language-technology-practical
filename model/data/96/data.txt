Pea farinata with zucchini is a delightful twist on a classic Ligurian dish. It's really all about showcasing those fresh, vibrant flavors of the region. This farinata recipe swaps out the usual chickpea flour for homemade pea flour, giving it a lighter, almost tender bite. And listen, that soft green hue? It totally whispers spring. Ligurians love their farinata, and this version—playful and fun—throws in moist zucchini slices, quickly sautéed before mixing in the batter.
Unlike your typical chickpea flour pancake or even socca , this dish offers a subtle earthiness from the peas, which is great for those craving something different, yet still rooted in Italian tradition. It’s a naturally vegan pancake recipe and gluten-free, pretty much perfect for anyone watching their diet. The crispy edges and soft middle make every bite super satisfying, and the mild flavor pairs beautifully with a sprinkle of black pepper or fresh herbs.
Regional touches? Yeah, you’ll find those depending on the season—sometimes folks add spring onion strips or baby greens with the zucchini. This zucchini pancake shows up a lot at picnics since it’s easy to cut and pack without losing its golden color or delicate taste. Plus, people love that it can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature. Great for lunches or snacks.
By using pea flour instead of chickpea flour, it feels a bit lighter, a fun way to incorporate more legumes into meals. I mean, some folks even liken it to a chickpea flour flatbread , though the texture is softer and a touch more sweet—thanks to the fresh zucchinis.
Whether you slice it into big wedges or smaller squares, this recipe brings a bit of Ligurian sunshine to any table. It really shows how simple ingredient swaps can make old favorites feel brand new. With just a few changes, you can transform this dish into something exciting and fresh. For real, perfect for any occasion.
