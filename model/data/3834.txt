In a bowl, place the yolks of 10 eggs with powdered sugar and the seeds of the vanilla bean, and whisk with a beater until you get a thick and homogeneous cream. Gradually add the alcohol, cognac, and dry marsala, continuing to mix with the beater, and finally add the milk. Place the mixture in a double boiler and, continuing to stir, thicken the cream (at least 10 minutes) until you no longer feel the texture of the sugar; the water in the double boiler should only simmer and not boil, otherwise you might end up cooking the eggs, ruining everything.
Let the Vov cool and store it in bottles in a cool, dark place, preferably in the refrigerator; although the eggs have been "cooked" in a double boiler and the alcohol present helps the preservation, unlike commercial products, our homemade Vov contains no preservatives, so caution is always best. Before enjoying it, remember to shake the bottle of liqueur well to mix it properly.
Store the egg cream liqueur (Vov) in a cool and dry place, such as the refrigerator. Once opened, it is advisable to consume it within 3-4 weeks at most.
For its known invigorating, restorative, and strengthening qualities, during World War II, Vov was widely distributed among soldiers, in packages of pressed cardboard glazed inside; later it was put in the classic brown glass bottle, which nowadays has become white and opaque, like an eggshell.
For the preparation of this liqueur, it is essential to use very fresh eggs, preferably organic. Depending on your taste, it is possible to modify the percentages of alcohol and sugar: the recipe's doses are for a light and pleasant liqueur to drink.
