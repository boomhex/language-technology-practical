instructions:
To prepare bucatini cacio e pepe with broccoli, bring water to a boil in a large pot: it will be used for both the bucatini and the broccoli. Remove the broccoli florets and then wash them. Then boil the bucatini and after 3-4 minutes add the broccoli florets .
While they are cooking, crush some peppercorns , then transfer them to a preheated non-stick pan . Toast them for a few moments, occasionally shaking the pan, then deglaze with a little cooking water .
Grate the Pecorino cheese and gradually mix it with the cooking water while stirring with a fork to create a creamy mixture . Before adding it to the pan, you can warm it with some steam from the pot where you cooked the pasta, to avoid thermal shock. Once the bucatini and broccoli are al dente, transfer them to the pan with the pepper and continue cooking, adding some pasta cooking water if necessary.
Add the Pecorino cream , turn off the heat, and mix the seasoning . Your bucatini cacio e pepe with broccoli are ready to be served .
It is advisable to prepare the bucatini and serve them immediately. No storage is recommended as the sauce tends to thicken once cold.
You could also try pairing cacio e pepe with turnip greens: with the leftover stems, you can create a tasty pesto to dress the pasta. Just boil them and then blend them in a mixer with grated cheese, oil, and a few basil leaves!
