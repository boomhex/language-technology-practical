instructions:
To make the fregola with portobello mushrooms, first prepare the Vegetable broth . Clean the mushrooms: cut off the base and use a cloth to remove any soil residue , then slice them and chop into small pieces .
In a large pan, heat the oil, add the garlic clove, and let it brown over low heat for a few minutes to flavor the oil , then remove it and add the fregola .
Toast the fregola for a few moments , then add the portobello mushrooms , stir, and continue cooking for about 20-25 minutes (follow the instructions on the package), adding the hot broth one ladle at a time, as you do with risotto, waiting for the liquid to be absorbed before adding more.
Halfway through cooking, add salt and season with thyme leaves . Once the fregola is cooked , turn off the heat
and finish with fresh chopped parsley and grated cheese . Serve the fregola with portobello mushrooms hot .
The fregola with portobello mushrooms can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days covered with plastic wrap. We do not recommend freezing.
To make the preparation even more flavorful, you can add crumbled sausage to cook together with the mushrooms.
