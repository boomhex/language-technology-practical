To prepare rhubarb jam, start with the rhubarb: remove the leaves and cut the stalks into pieces about 0.5 inch long , then wash them thoroughly under cold water . Place the rhubarb stalks in a bowl, and also add the sugar and grated lemon zest .
Then squeeze the lemon to extract 2.5 oz of juice, filtering out the seeds , mix well and let it rest for at least 2-3 hours, covered with plastic wrap . After this time, the rhubarb will have released some liquid, so pour the entire contents of the bowl into a pot and bring it to a boil.
Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes , stirring occasionally, then lower the heat and continue cooking for about 50-60 minutes until it reaches 226°F . Use a kitchen thermometer to measure the correct temperature. While the jam is cooking, dedicate some time to sterilizing the jars and lids as indicated in the guidelines from the Ministry of Health provided at the end of the recipe. Once the jam is cooked, jar it while still hot in the jars, being careful to leave about 0.5 inch of space from the rim and close them. If using jars with rubber-sealed closures, upon consuming the rhubarb jam, you can check the vacuum seal by pulling the appropriate tab: if pulling it produces a sharp noise, it means the content has been preserved with the correct vacuum. Conversely, if pulling the tab the seal feels "soft," it means the vacuum wasn't created correctly, and it's better not to eat the contents. If you use jars with screw lids, once the hot jam is jarred, screw the lids tightly but not too tightly and let them cool. The heat from the mixture will create the vacuum, allowing the product to be preserved for a long time. Once the jars have cooled, check if the vacuum has been created correctly: you can press the center of the lid, and if you don't hear the classic "click-clack," the vacuum has occurred. Once you have verified successful preservation, your rhubarb jam will be ready to enjoy!
Rhubarb jam keeps for about 3 months, provided the vacuum has been created correctly and the jars are stored in a cool, dry place, away from sources of light and heat. It's recommended to wait at least 2-3 weeks before consuming the jam. Once each jar is opened, store it in the refrigerator and consume it within 3-4 days max.
If the rhubarb releases too much liquid, add a few apple cubes to the jam; alternatively, dissolve 0.7 oz of cornstarch in a little rhubarb liquid cold and add it to the mixture. If you want to give your jam a redder color, since it will slightly lose it during cooking, add some strawberry pieces along with the rhubarb!
Homemade preparation of preserves and jams can present health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the necessary conditions and measures to ensure the safety and suitability of the food, which industrial procedures can provide to prevent dangerous contamination. It is therefore important to strictly follow food safety instructions to reduce risks, but one must always keep in mind that the same food safety as professionally produced preserves and jams cannot be achieved. For proper preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the guidelines from the Ministry of Health .
