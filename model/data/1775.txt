Piadina with culatello and artichokes, a really classic dish from Emilia-Romagna , Italy, is all about the region’s best flavors. It features a piadina recipe that gives you soft, thin flatbread—perfect for all kinds of fillings. And look, people in Romagna love this as street food. Really, it's no wonder why. The rich taste of culatello ham , a specialty from Parma, pairs beautifully with a fresh, slightly tangy artichoke salad. Add some shavings of Parmigiano Reggiano—another regional favorite—and you've got a meal that feels both fancy and relaxed. And using whole wheat piadina adds a hearty touch. You know, it's perfect for when you want something filling yet light. In Emilia-Romagna, enjoying this artichoke flatbread is a beloved tradition. For sure.

To make the piadina with culatello and artichokes, first, take care of cleaning the artichokes: remove the outer and tougher leaves and also peel the more fibrous part of the stem. Cut off the tips and cut each artichoke in half lengthwise .
Use a teaspoon to remove the central fuzzy part , then thinly slice the hearts of the artichokes , collecting them in a bowl as you go. Season with apple cider vinegar
Olive oil , then salt and pepper to taste, and finally flavor with 0.7 oz (20 g) of Parmigiano Reggiano shavings, obtained with a vegetable peeler . The artichoke salad is ready, now you can heat the piadinas: place a pan on the stove, heat it, and when it is very hot, lay down the piadina ,
and heat it for about 1 minute on each side . At this point, fill each piadina with 1/4 of the artichoke salad , 1.8 oz (50 g) of culatello
and Parmigiano shavings . Fold the piadina in half to close it and serve it immediately .
We recommend consuming the piadina within the day, taking care to store it in the refrigerator.
Make your piadina also with a fresh fennel salad or with grilled radicchio.
