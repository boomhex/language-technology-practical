To prepare strozzapreti, pour the flour onto a work surface forming a well , add a pinch of salt and start mixing with lukewarm water using a fork .
Once the water has been absorbed , begin kneading with your hands until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough .
Let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes covered with plastic wrap , or a cloth, at room temperature or in the fridge if it's too hot. After this time, take the dough and place it on a floured work surface . With the help of a rolling pin, start rolling out the dough .
Your goal is a thickness of 1/16 inch (10 . Once rolled out, start cutting it into strips about 1/2 inch wide .
Once you have the strips , take one at a time and roll it between the palms of your hands, letting it slip gently . Then detach pieces about 3-4 inches long and place them one by one on the floured work surface . Your strozzapreti are ready!

Why are they called strozzapreti?
The origin of this name is not known for certain: some trace it back to the combination of the Greek terms: "straggalao" to roll and "prepto" to hollow, which would refer to the formation of the typical twists. Another legend ties this dish to a priest who ate this dish so eagerly that he choked. In Emilia Romagna, the most accredited story traces this name back to the times when the region was subject to the Papal State, which imposed high taxes, thus displeasing the population.
