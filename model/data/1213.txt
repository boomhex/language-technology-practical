instructions:
To prepare the nests of tagliatelle with sausage ragù, first peel the carrots and onion. Cut them into large pieces and blend them in a mixer along with the celery sprig . Crumble the sausage onto a plate and set it aside .
Pour the oil into a saucepan, add the soffritto , and let it sauté for a couple of minutes . Add the sausage and let it brown .
until it is well browned . Now deglaze with the white wine and as soon as the alcohol has completely evaporated
add the tomato sauce . Season with salt and pepper, then cover with a lid and let cook for 40 minutes.
At this point, take a baking dish, large enough not to overlap the nests, and cover the bottom with the ragù . Place the tagliatelle nests on top and cover with the remaining sauce , making sure to cover the pasta well, as it will cook with it.
Cover the surface with grated Parmesan . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 25 minutes. Once a nice crust has formed, remove from the oven and serve your tagliatelle.
The nests of tagliatelle with sausage ragù can be stored for 2 days in the refrigerator.
Add some mozzarella cubes or another stringy cheese to the center of each pasta nest before cooking!
