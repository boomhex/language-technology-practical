To prepare the beer and mortadella risotto, put a pot with plenty of salted water on the stove that you will use for the Vegetable broth . Slice the mortadella and then cut it into rather small cubes and set aside. Finely chop the rosemary
and the shallot ; sauté the shallot in a large non-stick pot with the oil , then add the rice , letting it toast for 1 minute.
Deglaze with the beer , allowing it to evaporate. Let the rice cook, adding a ladle of vegetable broth from time to time , until the cooking is finished: it will take about 15 minutes. Halfway through cooking, add the mortadella previously cut into cubes .
A few moments before the end of cooking, add the grated lemon zest and the chopped rosemary . Turn off the heat and finally cream with the butter
and with the grated cheese , then add the freshly grated ginger . Plate the beer and mortadella risotto and serve it very hot !
It is recommended to consume the beer and mortadella risotto immediately. If you have any left over, you can store it for 1-2 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap.
Instead of butter, you can cream your risotto with mascarpone! Also, if you prefer, you can use dark beer instead of light beer.
