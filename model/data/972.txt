instructions:
To prepare the sushi rice, first, wash the rice to remove impurities. Then pour it into a bowl with cold water and replace it until it becomes clear. Then let it soak for an hour . Drain it and let it rest in the colander, placed on another bowl for 5 minutes. In a high-sided pot, pour 2 cups of water
and add the rice . Turn on the heat and cover the pot with a lid , we used a wooden one, but alternatively, you can use a classic one. When it starts to boil, stir the rice with a wooden spoon to ensure even cooking.
Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, then lower the flame and cook for another 7 minutes on low heat. At this point, remove the pot from the heat and let it rest for another 6 minutes without removing the lid. Then put the pot back on medium heat for another 30 seconds. The consistency should be slightly al dente. Now prepare the rice vinegar mixture, which will give the rice a slightly tangy taste. In a small pot, pour the rice vinegar and add the salt .
Heat over medium-low heat to dissolve the salt until it reaches a boil. Then add the sugar , stir , and turn off the heat. Let it cool slightly and add the kombu seaweed . A tip is to wash the kombu seaweed before adding it to the mixture to remove the white coating that is sometimes present on the outside of the seaweed and thus reduce the salty taste.
Take the rice and get the hangiri, a low, wide wooden container used for seasoning the rice. Wet it with water and drain it so that the wood does not absorb the vinegar. Pour the rice inside
and add the filtered vinegar mixture, letting it drip onto the spoon to spread it over the rice . Mix the rice by moving it with the edge of the spoon so as not to crush it . It is important to stir until it appears shiny and well-seasoned. To cool it down, fan it with a fan so that the vinegar evaporates quickly.
Once seasoned, transfer the rice to the ohitsu , the wooden container that will keep the rice's temperature and cover it with a damp paper towel to maintain constant heat . Alternatively, you can use a wooden or steel container covered with a damp cloth. When the rice is lukewarm, you can use it and serve it for your sushi .
Sushi rice can also be prepared in advance. Just heat it in the microwave for a few seconds until it reaches body temperature.
Nishiki rice can be found in the best stores selling oriental products. As an alternative rice grown in Italy, you can choose a low-starch rice, such as Originario.
For cooking: usually, the rice-to-water ratio is 1 to 1, but depending on the season, it may vary; in summer, you might need a bit more water. Instead of the hangiri, you can use another low, wide container, preferably not metal.
Rice vinegar is irreplaceable in this recipe.
With sushi rice, you can also prepare Onigiri !
