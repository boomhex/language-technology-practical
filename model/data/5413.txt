instructions:
Cocktail sauce, better known in Italy as pink sauce, is a very delicate and flavorful sauce based on mayonnaise and ketchup, mainly used as an accompaniment for fish and shellfish. The timeless shrimp cocktail is indeed made with this sauce. Due to its delicacy and the unmistakable aroma of brandy, cocktail sauce is highly appreciated and widely used for preparing tasty appetizers. It can also add flavor to sandwiches and wraps. Instead of ketchup, you can also try salsa rubra , a very savory tomato and vegetable-based red sauce that will surely add an extra touch of goodness!
To prepare the cocktail sauce, start with the mayonnaise. In the glass of a mixer, add the egg yolk along with salt, pepper , and the filtered lemon juice , then slowly pour in the vegetable oil in a thin stream while keeping the immersion blender running .
After a few moments, you will have obtained mayonnaise with the right creamy consistency. Then proceed to prepare the cocktail sauce. Pour the mayonnaise into a bowl and add the ketchup , Worcestershire sauce , and then the brandy .
Mix everything together . Finally, incorporate a few drops of Tabasco . The cocktail sauce is ready to be served .
Store the cocktail sauce in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
A great classic like this should be prepared at least once with your homemade mayonnaise! However, make sure it’s as compact and homogeneous as possible.
