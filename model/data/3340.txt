To prepare the flatbreads with tuna crust, start by making the arugula pesto. Place the well-washed and dried arugula, Grana Padano and pecorino cheese, pine nuts, extra virgin olive oil, and a pinch of salt in a food processor and blend everything until you get a creamy sauce . If the sauce is too thick, add more oil. Then prepare the crusted tuna: in a small bowl, put the breadcrumbs and poppy seeds
add the roughly chopped pistachios and mix everything together. Take the tuna steak, dip it in the egg white beaten with a fork , and then thoroughly cover it on all sides with the pistachio mixture . Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a non-stick pan, let it heat well, and sear the tuna on all sides for a few seconds over high heat; the inside of the tuna should remain red. Cut the tuna into pieces about 1.5 cm (0.6 inches) thick. Spread each flatbread with a generous teaspoon of arugula pesto, place a piece of tuna on top, and cover with a drop of arugula pesto.
Before consuming raw, marinated, or not perfectly cooked fish, it is recommended to freeze it for at least 96 hours at -0.4°F in a home freezer marked with 3 or more stars, according to the Ministry of Health guidelines .
