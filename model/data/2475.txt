To prepare the chocolate panna cotta eggs, start by chopping the chocolate with a knife . Then melt it in a bain-marie by placing it in a bowl or putting a saucepan in another pot filled with water, just enough to ensure the water doesn't touch the container where you've placed the chocolate . Meanwhile, in another saucepan, pour the cream ,
the condensed milk, and heat them together . Melt the chocolate well by stirring often and pour in the warm milk and cream mixture .
Mix everything well and also add the sifted powdered sugar . Dissolve the powdered sugar and squeeze the gelatin sheets, previously soaked in cold water for at least 10 minutes, with your hands .
Add the latter to the saucepan and stir quickly . Once the gelatin sheets are well-dissolved, use a ladle to pour the mixture into the half-egg-shaped mold and let it cool in the fridge for at least 4 hours .
After this time, whip the fresh cream that you will use for decoration. Pour the cream into a high-sided bowl and after turning on the mixer, add the powdered sugar . Continue whipping until you have a firm and steady mixture .
To successfully unmold the panna cottas, dip the mold for a few seconds in boiling water , then remove and place them on the plate where you will serve them. Pour the whipped cream into a piping bag and use it to decorate your dessert, with the help of some red berries and a few mint leaves for a touch of color. Your chocolate panna cotta eggs are ready!
The chocolate panna cotta eggs can be stored in the refrigerator for 4-5 days. It's best to leave them in their mold and cover them with plastic wrap!
You can flavor the chocolate panna cotta with orange zest and shape it as you prefer!!
Easter eggs, along with the dove cake, have become symbols of the Christian Easter holiday over time. The tradition of the classic chocolate egg is recent, but even in the Middle Ages, it was common to give real eggs decorated with any type of design or dedication.
