instructions:
To prepare farfalle with ricotta cream and Tropea red onions, start by bringing a pot full of water to a boil, salted to taste: this will be used for cooking the pasta. Peel the onions and slice them into rounds about 1/8 inch thick . Place a large pan on the heat, pour in the oil and add the onion .
Slightly salt and let cook over medium heat for at least 5-6 minutes. Add the brown sugar and a ladleful of the water intended for cooking the pasta, now hot . Let the water evaporate and turn off the heat.
Pour the ricotta into another large pot , big enough to easily contain the pasta, and add 2 ladles of hot water (about 5 oz/0.6 cup) and mix with a whisk , without turning on the heat. Grate the nutmeg, add the marjoram leaves , season with salt and pepper.
Cook the pasta al dente , drain it and pour it directly into the pot with the ricotta . Then add the Parmesan , turn on the heat, and mix everything thoroughly, cooking for another 2-3 minutes.
Also add the onions , keeping some aside for decoration, and mix everything together . Serve the farfalle with ricotta cream and Tropea red onions still hot, garnishing with the remaining onions .
Store the farfalle with ricotta cream and red onions in the refrigerator for a maximum of 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Choose Tropea red onions based on your preferences: the rounder ones will have a milder flavor, while the elongated ones will have a more intense taste.
