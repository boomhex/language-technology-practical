instructions:
To prepare the bannocks, pour the whole wheat flour and instant yeast into a large bowl , mix briefly, then add the softened butter and start working the dough with your hands .
Add the salt and the water, a little at a time , and continue to work the mixture with your hands or with a wooden spoon .
When you have obtained a soft and pliable dough, transfer it to a floured work surface and shape it into a large log, then divide it into 4 parts with a dough scraper . Flatten each portion of dough with your hands, using more flour if necessary to obtain 4 fairly thin flatbreads with a diameter of 5-6 inches .
Pour about 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large pan and heat it to 340°F. Fry one flatbread at a time for a couple of minutes on each side , using a spatula to turn it without risking breaking it, until it is evenly golden brown . Drain your bannocks on straw paper and salt the surface to taste !
It is preferable to consume the bannocks freshly made to enjoy all their fragrance. Alternatively, they can be stored for 2-3 days wrapped in foil. Freezing is not recommended.
There are many recipes for making bannocks: with or without yeast, with white or whole wheat flour, with salt or sugar, with lard or no fat. Cooking methods also vary: on a griddle, in the oven, deep-fried in oil, or browned in butter... with this recipe, you will get rustic and crumbly bannocks, perfect to enjoy on their own or to accompany other ingredients just as you would with bread!
