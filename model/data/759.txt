Crostata with salted caramel yogurt and chocolate is a fresh take on a classic Italian dessert that everyone just loves. Really, it's a crowd-pleaser. In Italy, you know, crostata pops up at family gatherings and Sunday lunches. But here's the thing—this version's blend of creamy yogurt, salted caramel, and rich chocolate ganache gives it a modern twist. Really good stuff. The crust, made from the classic pasta frolla, turns crispy and buttery after resting and baking—those chill times make a big difference.
With every bite, you get a tender shell, gooey chocolate, and a yogurt filling that’s just the right mix of sweet and salty. This isn’t your everyday chocolate tart or a basic fruit pie. Nope. It’s a crostata recipe that makes people say, "Wow, what is that?" And the sauce?
Many Italians have their own take on crostata, but this version shakes things up with bold, playful flavors—really different from traditional jams and creams. The salted caramel dessert layer is mellow, with a bit of tangy twist thanks to the yogurt, balancing all that rich chocolate. Truthfully, it’s a pretty easy dessert recipe to whip up, but it looks much fancier than most weekday treats. Seriously good. The ganache sets up smooth and silky on top, so every slice looks awesome.
You’ll taste both moist pastry and silky ganache in every forkful. Thing is, this Italian dessert feels special without being fussy, perfect for a casual dinner with friends or on a holiday table. For sure. Whether you are into baking with yogurt or just crave a sweet and salty flavor that wakes up your taste buds, this crostata is definitely going to hit the spot. It’s a real blend of tradition and new-school flavors that keeps things interesting with every bite. Can't go wrong.

To prepare the tart with salted caramel yogurt and chocolate, first, prepare the pastry. Place the flour , butter , and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Work the ingredients with the leaf attachment until you get a crumbly dough.
Add the brown sugar to the mixture and work for a few more moments. Separate the egg yolks in a bowl, add the vanilla , and pour them into the stand mixer .
Turn the machine back on until you get a uniform and soft dough . Transfer the dough to the work surface and quickly work it to obtain a dough ball .
Wrap it with cling film and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes . When it is well set, transfer it to a lightly floured work surface and roll it out to about a quarter-inch thickness. Place a 9-inch springform pan on the pastry and use it to cut a disc of the same size .
Place the pastry disc at the bottom of the pan and with the scraps, make strips about 1.25 inches wide that will be used to create the edge .
After adhering the base well with the side strips, trim the edge with a small knife . Prick the pastry base with the tines of a fork and lay a sheet of parchment paper inside the tart. Make cuts with the tip of a knife and bake in a preheated ventilated oven at 350°F for 15 minutes.
After the indicated time, remove the parchment paper and continue baking for another 10 minutes at 350°F in a ventilated oven, until the base is golden brown . Remove from the oven and let cool.
When the pastry shell is completely cold, remove it from the mold and transfer it to a plate . Now prepare the chocolate ganache. Finely chop the dark chocolate and bring the cream to a simmer. Pour the chocolate into a bowl, then add one-third of the cream and mix .
Add about half of the remaining cream , mix energetically and add the remaining cream. You should obtain a smooth ganache . Let it cool and in the meantime pour the caramel yogurt into the pastry shell .
Level the surface and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Blend the ganache with an immersion blender without incorporating air and once the 30 minutes have passed, pour it into the pastry shell .
When you reach the edge , refrigerate the tart for 30 minutes. Transfer the remaining ganache into a paper cone and keep at room temperature. After 30 minutes, decorate the tart with the reserved ganache, hazelnuts, pomegranate seeds, and thyme .
The pastry can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, or frozen for a month.
The baked pastry shell can be stored for a day at room temperature, under a glass dome, or frozen.
The pastry can also be flavored with cinnamon and vanilla.
If you prefer, you can add a tablespoon of honey to the ganache for a more pronounced taste and a shinier result.
