instructions:
To prepare the seafood panzanella, start with cleaning the squid: gently detach the head from the mantle , then remove the inner cartilage pen . Rinse under running water and use your hands to remove the innards from the mantle. Use a knife to cut the end of the mantle and remove the outer skin . Finally, slice the mantles into rings about 3/4 inch wide. Take the head and cut just below the eyes, then set aside the tentacles along with the sliced mantle.
Proceed with How to clean shrimp : remove the head , then peel off the shell and the intestine located on the shrimp's back. Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan, then add the squid and cook on high heat for 3 minutes.
Add the shrimp and continue cooking for another 3 minutes . Transfer everything to a bowl and set aside. Now move on to How to Clean and Open Mussels : use the back of a knife or a scouring pad to remove any impurities from the mussel shells, then pull out the beard from each mussel and rinse them multiple times under running water until the water is clear.
Place the mussels in the same pan where you cooked the shrimp and squid , then cover with a lid and cook on medium heat. After a minute, they will begin to open, so remove them from the pan as they open. Strain the cooking liquid and separate the meat from the shell . Set aside.
Now take care of the vegetables: peel the cucumbers and cut them into cubes about 3/4 inch . Halve the cherry tomatoes and slice the onion thinly .
Finally, cut the bread into cubes about 1 1/4 inch . You are ready to assemble the dish: in the bowl with shrimp and squid, add the mussels , the onion, and the cucumbers .
Add the cherry tomatoes and the bread, then pour the mussel's cooking liquid and season with basil .
Also, season with lemon thyme , lemon zest , and lemon juice .
Finish with a drizzle of oil and adjust with salt and pepper .
Mix well to combine all the ingredients . Plate and finish with a few basil leaves . Your seafood panzanella is ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the seafood panzanella as soon as it's ready. If necessary, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to one day in an airtight container.
You can substitute the shrimp with scampi or prawns, or add boiled octopus chunks!
To further enhance the dish, you can complete it with some anchovy fillets or pitted Taggiasca olives.
