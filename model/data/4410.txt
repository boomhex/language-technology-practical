The tender raspberry cake is a delicious and irresistible dessert that wins you over at the first taste. It combines the melt-in-the-mouth quality of dark chocolate with the tangy freshness of raspberries, in a classic and timeless combination. The base is that of the traditional tender cake , typical of Ferrara's pastry tradition, loved for its firm exterior and almost creamy interior, which here is enriched with a fruity twist and a savory note given by Maldon salt, which surprises. It is one of those desserts that makes a great impression without too much effort in the kitchen. Perfect to serve at the end of a meal, perhaps to conclude a romantic dinner or an evening with friends. If you love indulgent desserts with a hint of freshness, the tender raspberry cake will surely become one of your favorites. Are you ready to be tempted?
If you're looking for other variants of the tender cake, take a look at:
To prepare the tender raspberry cake, first melt the chocolate in a bain-marie . Add the salted butter cut into pieces and let it melt completely .
Separate the yolks from the whites and place them in two bowls. Add half of the sugar to the yolks and beat with an electric mixer until you get a frothy mixture. Gradually add the melted chocolate while continuing to work with the mixer . Add the remaining sugar to the egg whites .
Beat until stiff peaks form with clean and dry beaters . Add the egg whites to the chocolate mixture and incorporate with movements from top to bottom to avoid deflating the egg whites. Add the sifted flour and mix gently, again with movements from top to bottom.
Butter and flour a 10-inch springform pan, pour the mixture into it and level . Bake in a static oven at 350°F for 25-30 minutes. Remove from oven and decorate with hazelnut cream .
Continue with the raspberries , Maldon salt , and a few mint leaves. Your tender raspberry cake is ready to be served .
The tender raspberry cake keeps perfectly for 2-3 days under a glass dome at room temperature, as long as it's not too hot. If you want to keep it longer, you can store it in the fridge: in this case, we recommend taking it out at least 30 minutes before serving.
If you don't have raspberries available, you can replace them with red fruits, currants, or wild strawberries. If you love more intense flavors, try adding a teaspoon of instant coffee to the mixture: it will enhance the chocolate flavor.
