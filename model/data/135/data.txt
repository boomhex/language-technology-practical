Canned pasta e fagioli? It brings the warmth of Central and Southern Italy right to your table, even when you’re short on time. Really good stuff. It all starts with a simple base: that tender mix of carrots, celery and onion—which is pretty much common in many traditional Italian soup recipes.

Swirling in pecorino romano DOP and some cracked pepper gives this dish that unmistakable Roman twist.
