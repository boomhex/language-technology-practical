instructions:
To make the orange saffron risotto, first prepare the Vegetable broth following our recipe and keep it warm. Pour the rice into a large saucepan and toast it dry, stirring often . When it becomes translucent, start adding one ladle of broth at a time, always waiting for the liquid to be absorbed before adding more .
After about 6 minutes, season with the saffron threads and powder , making sure to set aside a few threads for plating. Stir gently and continue cooking for a total of about 14 minutes.
Once the rice is cooked, turn off the heat and stir in the cold butter and grated cheese . Mix everything together and let the risotto rest for a couple of minutes before plating.
Garnish the risotto with the reserved threads and finally, flavor with grated orange zest . Finish with a small leaf of chervil and serve your orange saffron risotto immediately !
It is recommended to consume the orange saffron risotto immediately. Leftover risotto can be stored for 2 days in the refrigerator, in an airtight container.
If you prefer, you can use only saffron powder or only threads, slightly increasing the quantity.
