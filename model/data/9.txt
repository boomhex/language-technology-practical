In Milan, folks have been making risotto with saffron for ages. And the zest? Whole new layer of aroma and flavor. The dish keeps the traditional smooth base from slowly cooked arborio rice and quality broth, but the orange gives it a tangy kick that just works with the earthiness of saffron threads . Seriously, it just works. The golden color alone makes it feel special, and you can see why some of Milan’s best chefs have started tossing in a bit of citrus for extra fragrance.
