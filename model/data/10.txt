instructions:
To prepare the potato pie with chicken and mushrooms, first boil the potatoes in a pot starting with cold water until they are soft; it will take about 30-40 minutes, depending on the size . In the meantime, cut the chicken breast first into slices , then into strips, and finally into cubes of about 3/4 inch .
Heat a little oil in a pan, add the chicken pieces , salt , and sauté over medium heat for about 8 minutes . Set aside.
Move on to the mushrooms: clean them by removing the earthy base and gently wiping them with a damp cloth, then slice them . Pour the mushrooms into a pan with a little oil and sauté over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, then salt .
At this point, the potatoes will be cooked, so transfer them into a 9.5-inch diameter pan that you have previously greased with oil. Mash the whole potatoes with the skin using the bottom of a glass to form an even layer covering both the base and the edges of the pan . Drizzle the surface with a little oil .
Sprinkle with paprika and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 15 minutes . Meanwhile, prepare the filling mixture: break the eggs into a bowl, salt, pepper , and beat well with a whisk.
Add the sour cream and milk and mix again to combine everything .
When the potato base is slightly golden, take it out of the oven and fill it with the chicken and sautéed mushrooms , distributing them evenly.
Finally, pour the egg mixture and sprinkle the surface with the mozzarella cut into sticks . Bake again at 350°F for another 40-45 minutes. After this time, remove from the oven and let cool slightly, then your potato pie with chicken and mushrooms is ready to be served !
The potato pie with chicken and mushrooms can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container.
If you prefer, you can cook the base in advance and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours; the next day, fill it with the filling and complete the cooking.
As an alternative to porcini, you can use the type of mushrooms you have available.
For a vegetarian version, you can replace the chicken with spinach!
