Start by making the sautéed apple compote: peel the two apples , remove the core, and cut them into small cubes . Heat a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil in a non-stick pan and add the apple cubes, also incorporate the cinnamon sticks and lemon zest . Sauté the apples for a few seconds, then deglaze with the white wine. When the wine has evaporated, add a pinch of salt and continue cooking the apples on low heat for about 10 minutes.
Finely blend the sautéed apples in a mixer (or use an immersion blender), remembering to set aside a few cubes to use for decoration. You should obtain a creamy and homogeneous compote. Cut the speck slices into strips and then start composing the appetizers: with a teaspoon, spread the apple compote on the “La Bottega di Olivia & Marino” flatbreads , add 2 or 3 sautéed apple cubes and the speck cut into strips, and serve!
