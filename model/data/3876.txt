To prepare Chifeletti, take 500 g of potatoes (about 1 lb), scrub the skin well, then wash them. Now place the prepared potatoes without peeling them to boil in plenty of salted water for about 25 minutes . To cut cooking time in half, you can cook the potatoes in a pressure cooker. When they are cooked and soft enough to be mashed, peel them while they are still hot and pass them through a sieve or potato ricer, depending on your preference . Then let them cool . Place the mashed potatoes in a large bowl (or on a work surface if you prefer).
At this point, add the flour , the egg , melted butter , and sugar .
Now adjust with salt and pepper. Mix all the ingredients well, until you obtain a homogeneous and dry mixture (if not, add a bit more flour) . Let it rest covered with plastic wrap for 30 minutes. Take the rested dough and roll it out on a work surface with a rolling pin .
Then, using a pastry cutter or a glass, cut circles with a diameter of about 6.5 cm (approximately 2.5 inches) . Fold the circles in half and lightly press them halfway along their length, thus forming the classic crescent shape . (Alternatively, you can form a very long stick with the dough about the thickness of a middle finger. Cut the stick into pieces about 4 inches long and bend them to form many "horseshoes." With this method, the final shape will be less plump, but the end result of the Chifeletti will be equally excellent!). At this point, heat extra virgin olive oil in a high-sided pan. Take a kitchen thermometer to check the oil temperature. When the oil temperature reaches 338°F ,
immerse the chifeletti obtained and fry them ; when they turn golden, remove them from the oil with a skimmer and place them on absorbent paper so that the excess oil drains off and they do not turn out too greasy . Then arrange the chifeletti on a serving plate and serve them hot !
Chifeletti can be stored for 1 day under a glass dome, but it is better to serve them as soon as they are made. Freezing is not recommended.
For this recipe, it would be better to use floury and low-water potatoes, preferably red ones. If you want to make your chifeletti sweeter and use them as a dessert, you can add more sugar and omit salt and pepper. Prepared this way, the chifeletti become practical and quick sweets to prepare for an evening with friends. As desserts, for an extra touch, you can serve them on a large plate, dusting with powdered sugar or adding some cinnamon powder. A note that will leave your friends speechless: decorate the plate with whole cinnamon sticks and drops of honey, guaranteed wow effect!
If you want to obtain puffier chifeletti, you can try adding 1/2 packet of baking powder to the dough. When fried, the chifeletti will increase in volume and become more fragrant.
