Hard boil an egg and then take the yolk. Put the minced garlic cloves, with the germ removed, in a mortar and crush them with salt. Place everything in a blender, adding fresh egg yolks: blend and add the oil in a thin stream until a thick cream forms. At this point, stop the blender and add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and the crumbled hard yolk; blend again for a few seconds, then salt, pepper, and adjust the salt to taste (or add more lemon juice if you like). Your aioli sauce is ready: place it in a bowl or a glass jar and keep it covered in the refrigerator for up to seven days.
For the aioli sauce to be perfect, you should use eggs and oil at room temperature; if the sauce curdles, you should remove it from the container (or blender) and replace it with a new yolk, with which you should resume the preparation, using little oil. Afterward, you can combine the previous sauce with the new one (in small amounts). If you want to make this sauce thicker, you can blend a small boiled potato with the other ingredients or some crumbled stale bread. To make the aioli more liquid, you can add a little hot water. A variation of aioli involves making the sauce without egg yolks; in this case, you can add a boiled potato as a substitute.
In Provence, aioli is considered not only a gastronomic symbol but also a cultural representative of their land; it was even praised by the French poet Frédéric Mistral, so much so that in 1891, he founded a newspaper to which he gave the name Aioli.
