Pour the beans along with their preserving water into a colander, then rinse them quickly under running water and let them drain well. Peel and thinly slice the Tropea onion , then place it in a bowl with a glass of red wine vinegar, covering it with cold water; let it soak like this for about half an hour, then drain it .
In the meantime, peel the garlic and then finely chop it and set aside . Move on to the anchovies, place them on the cutting board
finely chop these as well and then pour them into a small bowl along with the oil and the chopped garlic
1 tablespoon of vinegar , salt and ground pepper , and thyme leaves . Emulsify everything with a fork to combine the ingredients.
Pour the beans into a bowl , add the Tropea onion and the previously obtained sauce ; mix everything and serve, sprinkling the serving plates with freshly ground pepper and thyme leaves .
If you prefer to use fresh beans instead of canned ones, buy about 2.6 lbs of firm, unblemished pods. Alternatively, you can use about 12 oz of dried beans (which you will need to soak in cold water overnight to rehydrate) or 21 oz of frozen shelled beans.
