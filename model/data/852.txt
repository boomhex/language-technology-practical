instructions:
To prepare the salmon puff pastry croissants, first unroll the puff pastry on a surface . Using a sharp knife, divide it into 4 wedges , then cut each into 4 to get 16 pieces .
Fill each wedge with a piece of salmon , some grated orange zest , and a piece of Brie cheese .
Starting from the base, roll each wedge up to form a croissant shape . As you go, transfer the croissants to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them slightly apart . Beat the yolk with the milk, then use it to brush each croissant .
Decorate with sesame seeds and poppy seeds . Bake in a preheated fan oven at 375°F for 15 minutes. When they are golden brown, remove the croissants from the oven and let them cool before serving!
Store the salmon puff pastry croissants for a couple of days at most in a food bag. If you used all fresh ingredients, you can freeze them before baking.
Instead of salmon, you can use other smoked fish like tuna or swordfish.
Instead of Brie, you can use caciotta cheese.
