instructions:
To prepare the lasagna pockets, start with the sauce: in a pot, sauté the oil with the garlic, then add the tomato purée and a little water, just enough to rinse the can . Salt and bring to a boil, then reduce the temperature a bit and cook for about 45 minutes; at the end of cooking, the sauce shouldn't be too thick .
Cut the mozzarella into 15 pieces and transfer it onto a tray with paper towels to remove excess liquid . Move on to the spinach: in a large pot, sauté the oil with the garlic, then add the cleaned spinach .
Lightly salt, cover with a lid, and cook over medium heat for about 7-8 minutes . Once wilted, remove the garlic and drain them well by squeezing them in a colander .
Roughly chop the cooked ham with a knife , then do the same with the well-drained spinach . Mix the ham and spinach in a bowl and add a pinch of pepper .
Add the ricotta and mix everything together. Set the filling aside and focus on the béchamel: in a small pot, heat the milk with the salt and nutmeg . In another small pot, melt the butter, then add the flour .
Quickly stir with a whisk to make the roux , then add the hot milk and continue stirring until you get a smooth and thick sauce .
Pour the hot béchamel into the sauce and mix well . You're ready to assemble the pockets: cut the fresh pasta sheets in half lengthwise .
Take 2 strips and keep the others covered with a kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out . Pour a little sauce in the center of the first strip , then place the second strip perpendicular to form a cross .
Place a spoonful of filling in the center , then add a cube of mozzarella . Now fold the first flap toward the center and add a little more sauce, which will help the sheets stick .
Fold the second flap and add more sauce . Continue in this way, alternating pasta and sauce, until you form a square packet ; in total, you'll get 15 pockets. Cover the bottom of a 12x8 inch baking dish with a layer of sauce and arrange the pockets inside as you go .
Sprinkle the pockets with the remaining sauce, making sure to cover the sides well too . Finally, sprinkle with grated cheese and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 30 minutes . If you wish, you can turn on the grill and continue cooking for a few minutes to brown the surface well. Your lasagna pockets are ready to be served !
Lasagna pockets can be stored in the refrigerator, well covered, for 2-3 days.
You can also freeze them, either cooked or uncooked.
If you prefer, you can replace the béchamel with ricotta softened with hot milk or with stracchino cheese blended with a little milk.
If you prepare the lasagna pockets in advance, you can reheat them in the oven at 175°F-210°F for about 10-15 minutes, browning them just before serving.
