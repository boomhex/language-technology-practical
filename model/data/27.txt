instructions:
To prepare the blackberry and ricotta cake , drain the ricotta from the whey. Pour the brown sugar and whole eggs into a bowl , and whisk with electric whisks until you get a light and frothy mixture . Add the honey .
Add a pinch of salt , the drained cow's milk ricotta , and continue working with the whisks. Then, pour the vegetable oil in a thin stream while mixing .
Once the oil is absorbed, incorporate the all-purpose flour , almond flour , and sifted baking powder .
Work everything, then add the milk while continuing to mix with the whisks . Once ready , add 400 g of washed and gently patted dry blackberries .
Add the chocolate chips and mix . Line a 20 cm (8-inch) diameter cake pan with parchment paper, then pour the batter, leveling the surface with the back of a spoon . Cover with the remaining blackberries .
Sprinkle the sliced almonds and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F (180°C) for about 45 minutes (check the baking and do the toothpick test before removing from the oven). Once baked, take the super soft ricotta cake out of the oven , let it cool, then remove it from its mold to cool completely. Serve with powdered sugar if desired .
The blackberry and ricotta cake keeps at room temperature for 2-3 days. It can be frozen after baking.
The presence of fruit might moisten the batter considerably, requiring an extra 5 minutes of baking time, always do the toothpick test to adjust accordingly. You can substitute blackberries with raspberries or blueberries.
