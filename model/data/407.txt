instructions:
To prepare the leek omelette, start with the leeks. Trim them by removing the outer leaves, the green part, and any roots; then cut them into slices about 1/16 inch thick . In a pan, 11 inches in diameter, heat a drizzle of oil, then add the leeks and season with salt .
Sauté the leeks for about 6 minutes over medium heat, adding a little water halfway through cooking to prevent them from burning ; they should be golden and well softened . Meanwhile, in a bowl, pour the eggs and season with salt and pepper .
Beat with a whisk , then add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano PDO and grated pecorino .
Pour the mixture into the hot pan with the leeks , then distribute the eggs evenly with a spatula and cover with a lid .
Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes, then flip the omelette with the help of a plate and place it back in the pan . Cook on the other side for 7 minutes, slightly lowering the heat. Transfer the leek omelette to a serving plate and serve !
We recommend serving the leek omelette immediately. If necessary, you can store it in the refrigerator for one day.
You can add chunks of caciocavallo cheese for a melty touch.
