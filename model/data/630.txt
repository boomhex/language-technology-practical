instructions:
To prepare colored eggs, first cut the red cabbage into pieces . Immerse the red cabbage in water and let it cook for 30 minutes .
Meanwhile, immerse the eggs in boiling water, using a slotted spoon . Cook for 8 minutes, then drain them and place them in a bowl with cold water . Peel them gently and set them aside.
After 30 minutes of cooking the red cabbage, let it cool slightly and strain the cooking liquid . Divide it into two bowls and in one of the two bowls pour the lemon juice and mix.
In this way one will become purple and the other will remain blue . Now immerse half of the eggs in the bowl with the purple water and half in the bowl with the blue water .
Leave the eggs to infuse for at least 3 hours, overnight would be even better. Once the minimum infusion time has passed, remove the colored eggs from the water , dry them, cut them in half, and season with salt and black pepper before serving .
We recommend consuming the eggs within 24 hours.
Use the colored eggs to prepare stuffed eggs! The red cabbage, after cooking, can be used for a velvety soup.
