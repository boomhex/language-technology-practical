When it comes to classic Italian treats, a jam cake is just super good. It's the kind of dessert that makes any day feel a little more special. The base? Pretty simple. It’s this old-school batter Italians often use for everyday cakes and donuts. Comes together fast and always turns out moist and tender. Here's the deal: spoonfuls of blackberry jam are dropped right on top before baking. And look, this trick not only gives the cake a swirl of sweet jam flavor but also keeps every bite interesting.
Home bakers, you know, say it reminds them of the popular 'torta Nua,' but with the rich jam adding a fresh twist instead of custard. It's a great example of how Italian baking mixes tradition with whatever's handy—creating something both classic and a bit original.
In Italy, bakers sometimes worry about the jam sinking, so they use little tricks. Flour the jam lightly or chill it first—really smart moves—to keep those golden dollops right where they belong.
The result? A jam cake that looks as good as it tastes—each slice has pockets of tangy fruit, perfect with a hot cup of tea. Some even say it’s a softer, Italian twist on a Kentucky jam cake or a Southern jam cake , minus the spice or caramel icing.
This cake is ideal for breakfast or a snack—pretty much anytime, really—especially when you want something homemade without a lot of fuss. And even though it's not tied to a specific Italian region, this recipe captures that friendly, family table vibe found throughout Italy.
You'll find variations with apricot or raspberry jam, but blackberry remains a favorite for its deep, sweet flavor. For anyone seeking an easy jam cake , this style is super welcoming—everyday baking at its best. Nothing fancy here, just the kind of food that fills the house with the comforting aroma of home. So, whether you're enjoying it at breakfast or as an afternoon treat, this cake offers a warm hug in every bite. For sure.

You can use any jam you prefer to fill the cake! Store the jam jar in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours before using it: this way, you'll make its addition to the batter less "slippery," preventing it from sinking during baking.
Instead of oil, you can also use butter to grease the pan. Replace the lemon zest with other flavors like vanilla or cinnamon.
