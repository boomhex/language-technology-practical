To prepare the eel in almond crust, marinate the pre-washed and cleaned eel fillets in a bowl with two glasses of Chardonnay and bay leaves . Then, prepare the white polenta in a pot with water and salt . When the polenta is ready, place it in a greased rectangular baking tray with a little oil and level it to a height of about 1.18 inches (3 cm) . Set it aside and let it cool.
In the meantime, prepare the mulled wine reduction: heat the red wine in a saucepan, add the cinnamon stick, cloves, and orange peel. When the wine begins to simmer, ignite it with a lighter to remove the alcohol and let it simmer on low heat for another 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let it rest. Strain everything with a sieve and return it to medium heat on the stove. Now, add the cornstarch and stir with a spoon until the desired consistency is reached.
In a non-stick pan, lightly toast the almonds with sage, rosemary, and a pinch of salt and place them in a bowl. Once done, place the eel fillets on a cutting board and spread them with honey . Then, coat them in the previously prepared chopped almonds and herbs , adding salt and pepper. Cut each fillet into 3 pieces, forming small rolls secured with one or two toothpicks .
In a non-stick pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil, add a clove of garlic, and a tablespoon of chopped herbs. When the garlic starts to color, remove it and add the eel fillet rolls to brown . Increase the heat and add half a glass of Chardonnay to deglaze everything. Lower the heat and cook for about 15 minutes, turning often to ensure even cooking. Then, pass each roll once more in the almond mixture, ensuring it adheres well on all sides. Meanwhile, use a pastry cutter to cut discs from the now cold white polenta and brown them for 2 minutes on each side in the sauce where the eel browned. Finally, julienne the Chioggia radicchio and season it with orange juice, a little oil, salt, and pepper. Prepare the dish with a polenta disc in the center, on which you will place the eel rolls (without toothpicks) and a spoonful of mulled wine reduction. Serve with the radicchio salad.
