instructions:
To prepare rabbit Ischitana style, start by rinsing the tomatoes under fresh water , then dry them and cut them in half . Cut and remove the top part of the tomato .
Then slice them and then cut them into cubes , collect them in a small bowl. Then take a saucepan, pour in the oil and the peeled garlic clove with the green inner part removed (to make the flavor more pleasant) , fry gently for a few moments and when the garlic is golden but not burnt, remove it.
and add the pieces of rabbit washed and dried with a kitchen towel . Brown the meat for 4-5 minutes, turning the pieces on all sides for an even browning . Then deglaze with the white wine, little by little, turning the pieces of meat while pouring the wine . Let it evaporate over medium flame,
and when the wine has completely evaporated, add the diced tomatoes , adjust with salt and pepper , and cook for about 30 minutes with the lid on , stirring and turning the pieces of meat from time to time.
If the meat seems to dry out too much during cooking, you can add a little water (you can use the same bowl you used to collect the diced tomatoes) . Finally, add the hand-torn basil leaves and turn off the heat. The sauce should be dense and shiny; your rabbit Ischitana style is ready to be served piping hot !
It's best to consume rabbit Ischitana style as soon as it's ready.
You can store it in the refrigerator for up to 1 day in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
To add an extra note of flavor, you can add fresh chopped chili pepper to the preparation!
