When spring hits Italy, a radish omelette really becomes a thing. I mean, it’s colorful and fresh and captures spring like nothing else. Known as frittata ai ravanelli, it’s not your everyday omelette. It's packed with fresh spring veggies. Really good stuff. Think tender carrots, bright asparagus, and radishes with a crisp and slightly spicy kick. Radishes have essential oils just beneath their skin, so to be honest, if you want that full punch of flavor, don’t peel them. But hey, a quick peel works if you prefer it milder.
This dish is gently baked in the oven, not fried—pretty simple. You get an omelette that's light and perfectly balanced with moist flavors. And look, the colors stay vibrant, everything gets a bit golden on top. Seriously good.
In Italy, this radish omelette is usually cut into small squares and served as a starter. Which is great. It pairs beautifully with other summer frittata variations, like tomato and basil or zucchini. The harmony between the sweet carrot, crisp radish, and robust asparagus gives each bite a really, really good balance. It might remind you of a preserved radish omelette or a Taiwanese omelette from Asian cuisine. Thing is, this dish stays true to Italian roots, focusing on seasonal ingredients and gentle baking.
It's interesting to see the connections with dishes like chai po neng or a Chinese omelette , even if the flavors differ. You’ll want to grab a piece right off the platter—it’s so, so tempting. A light, satisfying option for spring gatherings, or just when you crave something special on a weekday. The mix of fresh flavors and textures makes this frittata a real crowd-pleaser—bringing a touch of Italian charm to your table. Whether with friends or solo, this radish omelette is sure to brighten up your meal with its colorful taste and beautiful look.
To prepare the radish omelette, start by cleaning the vegetables. Peel the asparagus and carrots and slice them into rounds (1-2), keeping the asparagus tips aside. Wash the radishes and slice them into fairly thin rounds as well .
At this point, finely chop the shallot and stew it with a drizzle of oil for about 5 minutes over very low heat , then add the carrots and let them cook for a couple of minutes .
After this time, add the asparagus rounds and the chopped thyme . Finish cooking for about 5 minutes and only at the end add salt and pepper. Let cool slightly and in the meantime, start beating the eggs in a large bowl, adding salt and pepper immediately .
Then, add the grated cheese , mix well, and also add the vegetables: both the carrot and asparagus mix and the sliced radishes .
Mix the ingredients well and pour into a pan lined with parchment paper , decorate with the reserved asparagus tips , and bake at 355°F for 55 minutes . Serve the radish omelette warm to best enjoy the various flavors.
The radish omelette can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days covered with plastic wrap; alternatively, it can be frozen!
You can try making the radish omelette by adding other vegetables, or you can substitute Grana Padano with Pecorino and add a pinch of marjoram!
