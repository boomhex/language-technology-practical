To make the puff pastry snail with mortadella and gorgonzola, first cut the slice of mortadella into small cubes , then take the already rolled-out puff pastry and with a pastry wheel cut the pastry lengthwise
dividing it into 4 equal rectangles . Now you can fill the pastry: distribute the gorgonzola in pieces and the cubes of mortadella
and finally the coarsely chopped walnut kernels , leave a 0.4-inch border from both long sides, then fold one rectangle of dough onto itself to create a strip
Do the same with all the rectangles of puff pastry , then line a round baking pan with parchment paper with a diameter of approximately 9.5 inches and in the center, coil a first strip in a spiral , continue with the second, making the ends adhere well
Continue in the same way with the other strips . Your snail has taken shape, brush the surface with the egg mixed with milk and bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for 25-30 minutes. Once cooked, your puff pastry snail will be golden brown, take it out of the oven and let it cool slightly before serving .
Store the puff pastry snail wrapped in plastic wrap for up to three days in the refrigerator, it is recommended to heat it before consuming. It is possible to freeze it after cooking.
It is possible to replace gorgonzola with another creamy cheese, such as crescenza, and to replace mortadella with speck or cooked ham.
