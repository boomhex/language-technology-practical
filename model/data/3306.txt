instructions:
Trifle is that kind of layered dessert that feels like a party in a bowl—really, it’s true. Bright colors, lots of moist cake, and plenty of creamy stuff all mixed together. Originating from England, the classic trifle recipe usually stacks pieces of sponge cake, custard, fruit, and a big cloud of whipped cream. And look, this version takes a note from an Irish cook’s style, sticking to those traditional trifle layers but skipping the alcohol. Instead of sherry, the sponge cake soaks up all the sweet juices from strawberries that sit with sugar, making it super juicy and fresh. Really good stuff. You get that perfect bite every time—some soft cake, some thick custard, a pop of fruit, and just enough whipped cream to keep things light.
There’s something easygoing about a fruit trifle like this. Pretty simple. No fancy rules, just piling good stuff together. People love having it at the end of a meal, but honestly, it works as an afternoon snack, too. The kid-friendly, alcohol-free part is a big plus, so everyone at the table can dig in. Sometimes, you’ll see different versions depending on the region, but this one is all about the tender sponge cake and the way the creamy custard blends with the crisp fruit. That mix of textures really makes an easy trifle dessert stand out from other sweets. If you want to make it look a bit fancy, just use a clear bowl so you can see every colorful layer. Best part? It’s super flexible—change up the fruit if you want, or make it with store-bought custard when you’re in a rush. However you do it, a big spoonful of custard trifle always tastes like something special, especially when it’s cold from the fridge and the cake has soaked up all that fruit flavor.
To take it up a notch, try experimenting with different fruits like raspberries or blueberries for a burst of tart flavor. You can also add a touch of zest with some lemon or orange peel mixed into the custard. And the sauce? This dessert isn’t just about taste; it’s about creating a beautiful centerpiece on your table. Watching the layers melt together as it’s scooped out is part of the fun, and each spoonful gives you a rich combination of flavors that’s both satisfying and refreshing. Whether it’s for a family gathering or just a regular day, this traditional trifle is sure to bring smiles and second helpings. Enjoy it chilled, and let the flavors transport you to an English summer afternoon, full of laughter and good company.
To prepare the trifle, cut the strawberries into regular slices and place them in a large bowl to macerate with powdered sugar , then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight : the sugar should completely dissolve and form a syrup with the strawberries.
Now take the sponge cake and cut it into cubes, about 3/4 inch thick (if you want to make the sponge cake yourself, follow our recipe: Sponge cake ), then set it aside and prepare the custard, using half the amount, following the recipe you can find Pastry cream . Now whip the cream together with powdered sugar until you get a very creamy consistency, then start assembling the trifle: take a large glass (either hemispherical or cylindrical) and place at the bottom some cubes of sponge cake ,
add a couple of tablespoons of strawberries with syrup , which will serve as the soak, then using two piping bags, add the custard and the whipped cream .
Now form a second layer by placing, as with the first, cubes of sponge cake , strawberries , custard, whipped cream, and to garnish, 2 strawberries cut in half .
The trifle can also be prepared in advance (up to one day) by storing it, covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator, but remember to add the top layer of whipped cream only shortly before serving it.
The sponge cake can be replaced with amaretti or ladyfingers. If you can't find strawberries or don't like them, you can replace them with seasonal fruit, such as pears or apples, using a different soak from the one we used (for a detailed guide on how to prepare the soak How to make syrup for cakes ). If desired, you can replace the fruit with jam of your choice.
