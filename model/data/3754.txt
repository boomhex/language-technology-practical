Soft layers and a pretty swirl make the Poppy Seed Roll with marzipan filling a real standout on any dessert table. Rich, moist dough made with homemade yeast dough gives every bite that classic fluffy texture families look for, while the bold filling – full of almond flavor and nutty poppy seed – adds just enough sweet taste to keep everyone coming back. People love seeing this roll sliced up for a weekend breakfast or as a coffee cake beside their favorite cup. The way the buttery streusel topping melts over the surface, picking up a golden look as it cools, just makes it even more inviting. Whenever folks want that touch of German baking or a treat reminiscent of family traditions (especially during the holidays), this is usually their first pick for serving family and friends.
Home cooks notice how well this almond roll fits in on busy days – reliable and easy for a family breakfast, brunch, or even as a simple after-dinner dessert. Looks nice on any celebration table, since the attractive swirl and rich marzipan filling stand out without needing fancy toppings.

Best part is, families appreciate how this roll stays soft and tasty all day, making it one of those celebration recipes you keep in your regular rotation for every get-together.

flavor with grated lemon zest . Finally, add the eggs and turn on the mixer , when all the ingredients are mixed, replace the flat beater with the dough hook, add the vanilla bean seeds ,
salt , knead with the hook and without stopping the machine, add the butter one piece at a time , waiting for it to be incorporated before adding another.
Continue until the dough is hooked, then place it on a work surface and shape it into a round shape , butter a bowl , place the dough ball inside, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rise in the oven with the light on for about 4 hours or until the dough has tripled in volume.
In the meantime, in a mixer bowl, place the almonds , chopped marzipan , blend everything together, then transfer the mixture to a bowl, add the poppy seeds ,
finally pour in the milk slowly, mixing with a spatula to combine all the ingredients. Take back the dough that has tripled in volume , roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured work surface
you should get a rectangular sheet about 8 x 12 inches and 1/5 inch thick . Spread the filling on the sheet and level it with a spatula, leaving a border of about 3/4 of an inch .
Brush the edge with beaten egg . Roll the sheet from the long side and seal the dough at the seams and fold the two ends down to close .
You will have obtained your roll , place it on a baking tray lined with parchment paper , brush the surface with beaten egg ,
score the surface with a smooth-bladed knife with crossed diagonals to create a diamond pattern , sprinkle with poppy seeds and bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 30 minutes (or in a convection oven at 300°F for 20 minutes). Once cooked, take the poppy seed, almond, and marzipan roll out of the oven, let it cool, and then serve it in slices .
