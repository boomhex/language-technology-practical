To prepare the currywurst, start with the accompanying sauce: finely chop the onion . In a pan, pour a drizzle of oil and sauté the onion ; when it is softened, add the paprika .
Then pour in the tomato puree and the ketchup, and let the sauce simmer. Finally, incorporate the cumin and the curry .
Adjust the salt and add a couple of ladles of hot water . Continue cooking until the sauce thickens, then turn off the heat and set the sauce aside. Move on to preparing the side dish: peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into sticks about 1/2 inch thick and 3-4 inches long .
Also, peel the yellow potatoes and slice them into thin chips with a mandoline . Heat the seed oil and fry the yellow potato chips and sweet potato sticks separately, ensuring you maintain a temperature of around 340°F to 355°F for optimal frying.
Then, drain the fried potatoes with a slotted spoon and place them on a tray lined with absorbent paper . Move on to cooking the sausages: bring plenty of water to a boil in which you have dissolved a tablespoon of curry , immerse the sausages and boil them for about 5 minutes, then drain them.
And pass them on the hot grill on both sides to make them golden brown (16-17). Serve the currywurst hot, accompanied by the sauce and plenty of french fries . Guten Appetit!
It is recommended to consume the currywurst as soon as it's ready and to store it in the refrigerator for a maximum of one day. You can keep the sauce in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
For preparing the currywurst, you can use the sausages you prefer: pork, chicken, or turkey.
