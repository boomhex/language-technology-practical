instructions:
To prepare eggplant pesto, first wash and dry the eggplants, then place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , pierce them with a fork and bake in a preheated convection oven at 430°F for 45-50 minutes. When the cooking time is up, remove the eggplants from the oven and let them cool on the tray . Once they have cooled, remove the top end and cut them in half ,
then scoop out the flesh with a spoon . Place the obtained flesh in a fine-mesh sieve, set the sieve over a bowl and press with a fork or the back of a spoon to drain the excess moisture .
At this point, transfer the eggplant flesh to a food processor with blades; add the almonds , grated Parmesan , grated lemon zest ,
and the extra virgin olive oil , then season with salt and pepper. Blend for about a minute until you get a thick and creamy puree, although not entirely homogeneous due to the partially chopped almonds that will add a crunchy texture. Finally, add the coarsely chopped mint leaves with a knife and stir. Your eggplant pesto is ready to be used !
Eggplant pesto can be stored in the refrigerator, in a glass jar covered with oil, for 3-4 days.
You can freeze eggplant pesto in small jars and thaw it at room temperature or in the refrigerator.
Eggplant pesto has a limited number of ingredients, but just a few targeted substitutions will alter its taste and aroma depending on how you use it: for example, you can flavor it with basil instead of mint, or you can use pecorino instead of Parmesan for a stronger flavor!
