For the sautéed broad bean peels, start by putting a pot with water on the stove where you will blanch the peels, then proceed to clean the pods by removing the central filament with the help of a small knife ; remove the two ends and do the same for all, keeping them separate from the broad beans which you can use for other recipes, such as the Fava Bean Salad . If you prefer, you can wear gloves to clean the broad beans, this way you'll avoid soil residues getting under your nails.
Rinse the broad bean pods under running water to remove any impurities , then immerse them in the boiling water , letting them cook for 5 minutes , just enough time to slightly soften them. Keep the cooking liquid as you will need it later to deglaze the peels.
After 5 minutes, drain the peels and rinse them under cold water to stop the cooking process ; drain them, place them on a cutting board, and cut them into diamonds by dividing the pods into 3-4 pieces depending on the length . If you prefer a milder garlic flavor, cut it in half and remove the core, then add it to a saucepan with the oil, letting it simmer for a few moments ;
when the oil is hot, remove the garlic and add the cut peels , letting them season for a few minutes on high heat and adjust with salt and pepper .
Meanwhile, slit a chili pepper, remove the seeds , then cut it into strips and add them to the broad bean peels .
Let it cook on high heat for another moment and then deglaze with a ladle of the broad bean cooking liquid you set aside (if you prefer, you could add Vegetable broth as a replacement) and let it cook for another 10 minutes until the sautéed broad bean peel dish is well dried .
It is advisable to consume the sautéed broad bean peels immediately. You can store it in a glass container covered with plastic wrap for up to 1 day.
Blanching the pods is essential, as cooking them immediately in the pan can cause them to darken. There are some tips to make this recipe irresistible, such as the addition of diced bacon or cooked ham. Try also with some shavings of parmesan or pecorino cheese!
