instructions:
To prepare the fake avocado mayonnaise, choose an avocado at the right level of ripeness: the flesh should be green and firm but slightly yielding to the touch. Cut your avocado in half and remove the pit . Remove the peel, using a smooth-bladed knife
and cut the flesh into cubes to get 9 oz. Squeeze the lime to extract the juice and add it along with the avocado to the immersion blender cup .
Add the sesame oil , a pinch of salt , and the rice milk .
Blend thoroughly to achieve a perfectly smooth sauce. Then add the Tabasco , adjusting the spiciness to your taste, mix well, and your fake avocado mayonnaise will be ready to enjoy!
You can store the fake avocado mayonnaise in an airtight jar in the fridge for 3-4 days. You can also freeze it if you've used only fresh ingredients.
If sesame oil is not available, or if you simply prefer a more Mediterranean touch, replace it with the same amount of extra virgin olive oil! Rice milk can also be replaced with good-quality soy milk if needed. If you wish to make your fake mayonnaise more sweet and sour, add a few drops of maple syrup or agave.
