instructions:
To prepare the roast beef in the air fryer, first focus on the How to tie a roast as if it were a roast . Insert a sprig of rosemary under the string .
Season with salt and oil , then massage the meat to distribute the seasoning evenly over the entire surface.
Place the meat in the basket of the air fryer (we used a fryer with a capacity of 6 liters) and cook at 392°F for 10 minutes, turning it halfway through the cooking time . At this point, set the temperature to 356°F and continue cooking for another 20-30 minutes , frequently turning the meat to prevent it from burning. The meat will be cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 118-122°F. Let it cool slightly.
In the meantime, prepare the sauce. In a bowl, pour the lemon juice, mustard , honey , salt and mix to combine the ingredients.
Add the oil in a thin stream and mix until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous sauce .
Slice the roast beef , plate it, and drizzle with the honey mustard sauce . Your roast beef in the air fryer is ready to be served !
The roast beef in the air fryer can be stored in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for up to 2-3 days.
If you prefer, you can also use other herbs besides rosemary, such as sage or thyme, for example.
For a more aromatic version, you can marinate the meat for at least 2 hours in a mixture of orange juice, lemon, oil, and aromatic herbs before cooking it.
