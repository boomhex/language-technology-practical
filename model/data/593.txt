To prepare the pizza dough, we chose to knead everything by hand, but if you prefer to use a mixer, you can follow the same procedures, using the hook at medium-low speed. First, pour the flour into a bowl , then crumble the yeast inside and pour the water gradually . The ideal water temperature is 77°F.
Mix gradually with a wooden spoon and when you have added almost all the water, add the salt as well . Continue to pour the water and start kneading with your hands to mix the ingredients together .
Finally, transfer the dough to the work surface and knead it with your hands until it is smooth and homogeneous . At this point, let it rest on the work surface for about ten minutes, covering it with the bowl . Once it's rested, give it a small fold: imagine that the sphere is divided into 4 parts, take the end of each one, pull it gently, and fold it towards the center .
Once you have made the 4 folds by turning it over itself , shape it into a sphere . Transfer the formed dough into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise . For convenience, you can put the bowl in a turned-off oven with the light on, so the inside reaches a temperature of 79°F-82°F, ideal for rising; alternatively, you can also keep the bowl in a warm place. The times are approximate as every dough, temperature, and weather conditions affect rising: on average, the dough should take 6 hours to double in volume.
After the rising time, the dough will be beautifully swollen , then transfer it to the work surface and divide it with a scraper into 3 pieces of 9.35 oz . If needed, you can lightly flour the work surface. Now take each portion and, as done before, lift a flap of dough and bring it towards the center. Repeat the same operation for the other 3 flaps of dough .
Turn the dough over and proceed with pirlatura: pirlare the dough means rotating it with your hands on the work surface, bringing it towards you and then pushing it away repeatedly until you get a smooth and regular sphere . Gradually transfer the dough pieces into a pizza box previously greased and cover with its lid .
Let rest for another 30 minutes . Meanwhile, place the pizza stone in the oven, positioning it high. Turn on the oven bringing the temperature to 482°F and activating the static mode. Now using a scraper, gently lift the first dough piece . Transfer it to a surface with plenty of semolina and add a little more semolina on top. With your fingertips, press the dough piece in the center .
Continue this way making a rotating motion to spread the dough . Never press the edges, and continue until you get a disc with a diameter of 11 inches . Transfer the dough onto the paddle, being careful not to ruin it .
Now, with the help of a spoon, spread the tomato puree on the pizza, leaving the edge free . Bake, letting the pizza slide gently onto the pizza stone and let it cook for about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the mozzarella into sticks or shred it with your hands. You can squeeze it gently so it doesn't release too much water during cooking . After 6 minutes, always using the paddle, remove the pizza from the oven .
Place the mozzarella sticks on top and bake for another 6 minutes or so. When the pizza is well browned, remove it from the oven, add the basil leaves , and if you like, a drizzle of oil and serve. Cook the other two pizzas in the same way and enjoy your simple Margherita pizza piping hot !
Once you've stretched the pizza, transfer it into a previously greased baking tray. Top the pizza with the puree and bake in a preheated static oven at 482°F for 6-7 minutes on the middle rack.
After this time, remove the pizza from the oven, add the mozzarella, and bake again for 6-7 minutes at the same temperature. Then remove your Margherita pizza from the oven and garnish with fresh basil leaves.
If you prefer to bake the pizza in a rectangular tray, it won't be necessary to divide the dough into multiple pieces, just make one. After the second rising, spread it in a 12x16 inches tray, top the pizza, and bake it in a preheated static oven at 482°F for 25-30 minutes.
The pizza dough, once risen, can also be frozen, better if already divided into portions, and stored in a freezer bag. Later, you'll only need to let your portion thaw at room temperature and proceed according to the recipe.
If you prefer, you can also freeze the Margherita pizza semi-cooked: just perform half of the cooking, let it cool, and finally freeze it covered with aluminum; later, you just need to cook it, still frozen, at a slightly lower temperature.
With this same dough, you can also make these delicious variants:
