instructions:
To prepare leek farinata, first wash the green part of the leek thoroughly and slice it into rings . In a pan, pour a drizzle of oil , add the leek, and cook it for about 5 minutes, adding a little water. Meanwhile, prepare the farinata. In a bowl, pour the chickpea flour and 3 tablespoons of oil .
Add salt, pepper , and half a teaspoon of turmeric . Pour the water slowly , stirring with a whisk.
You should obtain a rather liquid mixture without lumps . At this point, the leeks will be well sautéed, turn off the heat . Transfer the farinata mixture into a previously greased 11x14 inch baking tray , to achieve a thickness of about 1/5 inch.
Add the leek leaves on top , spreading them well over the entire surface . Bake in a preheated static oven at 428°F for about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve the farinata hot or warm!
The leek farinata is best enjoyed right out of the oven, but it can be stored in the fridge covered for up to 2 days. We recommend reheating it before serving.
Farinata allows you to revive all the vegetables you have forgotten in the refrigerator, such as a handful of spinach or half an onion, or some boiled potatoes or leftover zucchini. You can also try it with salmon or shrimp. And don't forget to use the aromatic herbs!
