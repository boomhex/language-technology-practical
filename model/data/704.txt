instructions:
To prepare the onion calzone, first clean the onions , wash them several times to remove the acidity. Roughly chop the onions . Place the onions in a baking tray, season with salt .
Also add the oil , pepper, and peeled tomatoes . Mix and cook in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 50 minutes.
Now take care of the calzone dough: in a small bowl, crumble the yeast, add 1/4 cup of water taken from the total amount . Mix to dissolve the yeast . In another larger bowl, pour the flour, and in the center pour the water in which you dissolved the yeast .
Also add the remaining water little by little while mixing , add the salt . Knead to absorb the liquid .
Transfer the dough onto a floured work surface , work again with your hands until you get a smooth and homogeneous consistency .
Divide the dough in half and form two balls . Cover with a dish towel and let rise for 1 hour at room temperature away from drafts. Then roll out one ball with a rolling pin on a floured work surface .
You need to obtain a dough sheet not excessively thin, less than 1/4 inch , with a diameter of 14 inches, corresponding to the baking tray. Grease a 14-inch diameter and 2.17-inch high mold, place the dough disc here . Meanwhile, the onions will be cooked , let them cool slightly.
Add to the onions the Pecorino , raisins , and olives .
Finally, incorporate the egg , mix and pour the filling into the baking tray leaving the outer edge free .
Roll out the other dough ball so that it is slightly thinner than the base, and cover the baking tray . Press the edges to seal, then pinch, fold over , and seal with the tines of a fork .
Make a hole in the center , prick the surface with a fork to prevent the calzone from puffing up during cooking and pour the oil .
Distribute the oil evenly and bake in a preheated static oven at 482°F for 20 minutes. Once cooked, remove the onion calzone from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving .
The onion calzone can be stored in the fridge for 3-4 days. You can freeze it after cooking.
You can add strong ricotta, a typical spreadable cheese product, with a distinctly bitter and pungent taste.
