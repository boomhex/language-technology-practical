To prepare the grilled ribs, start by preparing the marinade, which will be used to flavor the meat and make it more tender and tasty. In a wide and shallow bowl with enough capacity, pour the wine , then add the cleaned and coarsely chopped shallot and the whole sprigs of rosemary .
Now cut the ribs and place them in the marinade, making sure to immerse them well . At this point, add the extra virgin olive oil ,
salt, and pepper . Your ribs are ready to rest : cover the bowl with plastic wrap and transfer them to the refrigerator, where they should remain for about 2 hours. Remember to turn them after about an hour so that they are perfectly flavored on both sides.
In the meantime, prepare the side sauce. In the mixer, chop the onion . Meanwhile, heat the oil in a non-stick saucepan and add the peeled garlic, coarsely chopped .
Sauté the garlic for a few minutes, so that the oil is well flavored . When it is golden, remove it and add the chopped onion .
Let it stew for about 10 minutes, gradually adding the vinegar and letting it evaporate. Keeping the heat very low, add all the other ingredients one by one: first the tomato sauce , then the paste ,
then the mustard , the chili pepper , the brown sugar , always stirring as you add a new ingredient.
Also add the Tabasco , Worcestershire sauce , salt, and pepper
Finally, stir again to combine all the ingredients. Remove the sauce from the heat and strain it with the help of a spatula and a fine-mesh strainer .
Your sauce is ready: transfer it to a small bowl . After the 2 hours of resting, drain the ribs from their marinade
and cook them on a very hot grill for about 20 minutes, or until they are cooked, turning them halfway through cooking . Serve your grilled ribs hot, accompanied by the previously prepared sauce .
It is preferable to consume the ribs immediately after cooking. You can store the raw meat immersed in its marinade until ready to cook, covered with plastic wrap. The side sauce can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap. Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer, you can use pork chops instead of ribs! In this case, the marinating time will be about an hour at room temperature. If you prefer to use tenderloin, roast, or other large cuts, just increase the marinating time to one or 2 days: this way the flavors will have plenty of time to penetrate the meat and make it tender and tasty!
