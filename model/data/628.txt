instructions:
To make the asparagus pesto, start by cleaning. Remove the woodier ends and peel the remaining part of the stem, leaving the tips intact . You will need about 8 oz of cleaned asparagus. Blanch the asparagus in salted water for about 10 minutes .
Drain the asparagus, pat them dry with a cloth , and cut them into pieces . Place the almonds in a food processor and chop them coarsely.
Add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano PDO and Pecorino and blend again for a few moments. Now add the asparagus and a few drops of lemon juice .
Add the oil and season with salt, pepper , and nutmeg .
Close the food processor and pulse to avoid heating the mixture. As soon as you have a creamy and rustic consistency , the asparagus pesto is ready to use .
The asparagus pesto can be stored in the fridge for 4-5 days in an airtight container, covered with a layer of oil on the surface.
If you prefer a stronger taste, add a clove of garlic!
