If you're hunting for something different in sushi, gunkanmaki is a must-try. This Japanese sushi style really offers a twist—it's not your typical roll. Think of a small oval of fluffy sushi rice wrapped with nori seaweed. And here's the thing: the nori is taller than the rice, forming this "boat" shape that holds all sorts of yummy toppings. That's why they call it battleship sushi —it looks like a tiny vessel piled high with colorful ingredients. You'll often see it with salmon roe, chopped seafood, or even a creamy fish tartare. I mean, the combo of shiny and tender toppings against the dark nori? It's so so visually stunning and super tasty, too. This style is perfect for when you've got ingredients that are just too slippery or loose for traditional rolls, giving you a bite that's both eye-catching and full of flavor. Pretty simple, right?
The detail in gunkan maki goes down to the rice itself. You know, nailing the perfect sushi rice is crucial. It's gotta be sticky enough to hold together but still fluffy and just a bit sweet from the rice vinegar. How the rice is seasoned and shaped really enhances the taste of the nori and whatever toppings you choose. Plus, there are lots of sushi varieties using this "battleship" shape, with everything from luxurious fish roe to bits of shellfish that might slide off other sushi types. People really enjoy playing around with different colors and textures, creating plates of gunkanmaki that look almost too good to eat. And listen, whether you're new to homemade sushi or just eager to mix things up, gunkanmaki is a fun way to bring some glossy, bright sushi right to your table. It's perfect for exploring the colorful and diverse world of Japanese cuisine, offering bites that are as satisfying to look at as they are to eat. Seriously, can't go wrong with that.
To prepare the gunkanmaki, start by dividing a sheet of nori seaweed into strips about an inch wide . Take about 1 oz of cooked sushi rice, after wetting your hands in water with a few tablespoons of rice vinegar, and shape it into an oval-shaped ball . Place it in the center of the nori strip, leaving the shiny side of the seaweed on the outside .
Wrap the nori seaweed around the rice ball and spread some cooked rice grains along the upper edge of the seaweed , then secure the edges well .
Flatten the rice ball and fill the empty space created with a couple of tablespoons of fish eggs or ingredients of your choice cut like a tartare. Your gunkanmaki are ready .
Store them in the refrigerator, covered with a sheet of plastic wrap, until ready to serve and for no more than one day in the refrigerator.
