And the sauce? To be honest, it is seriously good. Instead of big layered pans, each bundle is its own mini celebration, filled with soft fresh egg pasta, savory ham, creamy ricotta, and spinach. This delicious mix gets wrapped up, covered in béchamel sauce, and baked until the tops are golden and a bit crispy. Honestly, folks in Italy love their traditional Lasagne alla Bolognese, but this style really stands out for festive days or any family meal where you want something fun and a little different.

To prepare the lasagna pockets, start with the sauce: in a pot, sauté the oil with the garlic, then add the tomato purée and a little water, just enough to rinse the can . Salt and bring to a boil, then reduce the temperature a bit and cook for about 45 minutes; at the end of cooking, the sauce shouldn't be too thick .
Cut the mozzarella into 15 pieces and transfer it onto a tray with paper towels to remove excess liquid . Move on to the spinach: in a large pot, sauté the oil with the garlic, then add the cleaned spinach .
Lightly salt, cover with a lid, and cook over medium heat for about 7-8 minutes . Once wilted, remove the garlic and drain them well by squeezing them in a colander .
Roughly chop the cooked ham with a knife , then do the same with the well-drained spinach . Mix the ham and spinach in a bowl and add a pinch of pepper .
Add the ricotta and mix everything together. Set the filling aside and focus on the béchamel: in a small pot, heat the milk with the salt and nutmeg . In another small pot, melt the butter, then add the flour .
Quickly stir with a whisk to make the roux , then add the hot milk and continue stirring until you get a smooth and thick sauce .
Pour the hot béchamel into the sauce and mix well . You're ready to assemble the pockets: cut the fresh pasta sheets in half lengthwise .
Take 2 strips and keep the others covered with a kitchen towel to prevent them from drying out . Pour a little sauce in the center of the first strip , then place the second strip perpendicular to form a cross .
Place a spoonful of filling in the center , then add a cube of mozzarella . Now fold the first flap toward the center and add a little more sauce, which will help the sheets stick .
Fold the second flap and add more sauce . Continue in this way, alternating pasta and sauce, until you form a square packet ; in total, you'll get 15 pockets. Cover the bottom of a 12x8 inch baking dish with a layer of sauce and arrange the pockets inside as you go .
Sprinkle the pockets with the remaining sauce, making sure to cover the sides well too . Finally, sprinkle with grated cheese and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 30 minutes . If you wish, you can turn on the grill and continue cooking for a few minutes to brown the surface well. Your lasagna pockets are ready to be served !
Lasagna pockets can be stored in the refrigerator, well covered, for 2-3 days.
You can also freeze them, either cooked or uncooked.
If you prefer, you can replace the béchamel with ricotta softened with hot milk or with stracchino cheese blended with a little milk.
If you prepare the lasagna pockets in advance, you can reheat them in the oven at 175°F-210°F for about 10-15 minutes, browning them just before serving.
