instructions:
To prepare the vegetable burgers, first peel the carrots and cut them into strips and then into cubes about 1/4 inch (5-7 mm) . Separate the broccoli florets .
Remove the outer parts of the stalk and cut it into strips and then into cubes about 1/4 inch (5-7 mm) . In a non-stick skillet, pour a drizzle of oil and add the garlic .
Add the tomato paste and let it flavor for a few minutes. Then add the carrots , and broccoli .
Then add the curry , season with salt , and cook over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes. Add the corn .
Remove the garlic and add the spinach . Once they have wilted, let them cook for another 5 minutes .
Transfer half of the vegetables to a food processor and blend until smooth . Then transfer it to a bowl and add the remaining vegetables .
Flavor with parsley , then add the eggs and mix. Finally, add the breadcrumbs .
Mix again until you get a shapeable mixture . Flour a tray where you intend to shape your burgers. With slightly wet or oiled hands, take 3 oz (90 g) of the mixture and form a large meatball . Place it inside a 3-inch (8 cm) diameter ring mold and press it to form a patty , or you can shape them by hand.
Turn it over to flour the other side as well . In the end, you should get 6 burgers . In a non-stick skillet, heat a drizzle of oil and then cook the burgers for 2-3 minutes per side, turning them gently .
Once cooked, place them on absorbent paper to remove excess oil and season with a pinch of salt . Your vegetable burgers are ready to be enjoyed : serve them, for example, with arugula and a yogurt sauce.
The vegetable burgers can be stored in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for 2-3 days. Once cooked, you can also freeze them.
You can vary the vegetables by always using those in season; you can also enrich the mixture with grated cheese. If you want a more protein-rich mixture, you can add cooked legumes such as chickpeas, lentils, or beans.
