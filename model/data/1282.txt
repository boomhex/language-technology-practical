instructions:
To make mushrooms and potatoes, first peel the potatoes, cut them into chunks , and place them in a large bowl. Take the mushrooms, cut off the end of the stem , and then quickly rinse them under a jet of cold running water to remove any soil residues .
Add the mushrooms to the same bowl , season with rosemary needles, oil , coarse salt , and ground black pepper.
Also pour in the white wine and stir to flavor, then transfer everything to a high-sided baking dish and bake in a static oven at 392°F for 50 minutes. Once cooked, remove from the oven, let cool slightly, and then serve the mushrooms and potatoes hot.
The tray of potatoes and mushrooms can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days. We do not recommend freezing.
Mushrooms are very delicate, we recommend washing them quickly so they don't absorb too much water. If they are not very earthy, you can just clean them with a damp cloth.
