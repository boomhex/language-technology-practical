So here's the deal, if you're looking to shake things up from your usual pasta dishes, you gotta try lasagna with ricotta and nettles . Seriously, it's a game-changer. Hailing from Southern Italy , this dish turns humble wild plants into something really, really special. And nettles—called ortiche over there—are foraged from the countryside. Once blanched, they lose their sting and reveal a slightly bitter flavor that's kinda like arugula. When you mix them with creamy ricotta, you get a blend that's sweet and earthy. Really good stuff, and it pays homage to traditional recipes where every ingredient is used thoughtfully. For generations, folks down south have been crafting this nettle lasagna recipe , using the bounty of the land to create tender pasta dishes that surprise and delight.
Imagine diving into a dish that feels both comforting and new. And look, while a classic lasagna might lean on spinach or just cheese, ricotta and nettle pasta takes you on a journey into rustic, countryside cooking. Telling friends you're serving homemade lasagna with nettles ? That's adding a bit of adventure to your meal. Yet, it all comes together in a cozy, familiar way. The moist ricotta layers keep everything soft, while the nettles add a wild twist. Not overpowering, just right. It's perfect for those who dig foraged foods or want a healthy lasagna alternative. Even picky eaters, who can be super super hard to please, often find themselves asking for seconds. Down in Southern Italy, they focus on making simple food with care—bringing everyone together. For sure.
So, if you're looking to spice up pasta night, a nettle and ricotta filling could be the surprise hit. It is the kind of thing that gets everyone talking—and curious about this old Italian trick you picked up. With flavors that are fresh, a touch earthy, and super comforting, this vegetarian lasagna with ricotta shows how much fun you can have with seasonal, local ingredients. Pretty much, it's a great way to explore Italy's culinary traditions while enjoying a meal that's both familiar and novel. Can't go wrong.
To prepare the lasagna with ricotta and nettles, start by cleaning the nettles. Using disposable kitchen gloves, separate the leaves from the stems : you should get about 1.2 lbs of tips, wash them thoroughly and let them drain .
At this point, to neutralize their stinging power, blanch the nettles in boiling water , slightly salted. After a few minutes, drain them and squeeze them with your hands .
Pour the oil into a large pan, add the garlic and let it brown; then remove it, add the nettles (7-8) and sauté them for a few minutes . Then turn off the heat and set aside.
Once the nettles are prepared, proceed with making the ricotta cream. Pour the ricotta into a bowl, add the oil , salt, a pinch of black pepper, and water ; then using a whisk, beat everything until you get a homogeneous cream .
Grease the bottom of an 8x12 inch pan, spread a layer of ricotta cream and place a first layer of lasagna sheets to cover the entire surface. Add more ricotta cream ,
spread it over all the sheets and sprinkle with thyme leaves . Add a grating of nutmeg and some nettles .
Cover with another sheet and proceed in this way, alternating lasagna with ricotta and nettles, for 2 more layers . Cover the last layer of pasta with ricotta cream ,
the thyme leaves, nutmeg, remaining nettles and sprinkle the entire surface with grated Grana cheese . Bake in a preheated static oven at 390°F for 20 minutes (if using a fan oven, at 355°F for 15 minutes). Finish cooking on grill mode for another 2 minutes, until a light crust forms. Remove from the oven your lasagna with ricotta and nettles and let it cool for 5-6 minutes before serving .
Lasagna with ricotta and nettles can be stored in the refrigerator, once cooked, for up to 2 days covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container.
You can also freeze them. To do this, proceed as follows: freeze the cooked lasagna in an airtight container or an aluminum tray for up to 30 days. To thaw the lasagna, take them out of the freezer and put them in the refrigerator the night before use. It is recommended to reheat the lasagna in an already hot oven for about ten minutes to revive them.
Try using sheep or buffalo ricotta for a surprising taste! To enrich this lasagna, try adding some diced smoked cheese (scamorza)!
