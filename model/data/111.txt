instructions:
To prepare the gluten-free chestnut gnocchi, first put the ricotta in a bowl , then add the chestnut flour and the egg .
Season with nutmeg and salt , then mix the ingredients with a spoon .
Transfer the mixture to a floured work surface and continue to work it with your hands until you obtain a soft, homogeneous, and slightly sticky dough .
Shape the dough into logs , then cut them into smaller pieces and dust them lightly with flour .
Work the logs until they reach a thickness of about 3/4 inch , then cut them into pieces of the same size . Your gluten-free chestnut gnocchi are ready to be cooked and dressed as you like !
It is recommended to cook the gluten-free chestnut gnocchi immediately once prepared. You can store them after cooking, in the refrigerator or freezer.
It is preferable to use very dry ricotta; otherwise, we recommend draining it in a colander before using to remove excess liquid.
