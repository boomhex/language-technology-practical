instructions:
To make the tea steamed cod, first place a pot full of water on the stove, add the dried lemon tea leaves (1-2) and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, take the fennel and cut off the bottom part ,
remove the first outer tough leaf , then cut the core in half , and divide each half into 3 wedges . Keep the thin green fronds aside for cooking.
Now take a bamboo steamer basket, line the base with a piece of parchment paper. Place the cod and the fennel wedges, season with salt and pepper, and finally distribute the green fennel fronds on top . Now take a second bamboo steamer basket and repeat the same operations.
Place the bamboo baskets one on top of the other over the pot where the water with the tea infusion is boiling (10-11), cover with the appropriate lid , and let cook over medium heat for 15 minutes.
When cooking is complete , dress with a drizzle of raw olive oil , then serve the tea steamed cod hot accompanied by the fennel.
It is preferable to consume the tea steamed cod immediately. Freezing is not recommended.
If you don't have bamboo baskets, you can use a regular steamer. If you can't find tea with lemony notes, you can flavor the water with lemon zest.
