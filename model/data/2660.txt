Torta di grano saraceno e confettura di ribes is seriously one delicious dessert. It's really, really popular in Northern Italy —especially in the Alto Adige and Trentino areas. This ricetta tradizionale altoatesina is all about its earthy, nutty flavor thanks to the buckwheat flour. Each slice has this kind of rustic and sorta tender texture. It’s not your everyday sweet cake. Nope, the buckwheat gives it a bold taste that works perfectly with the slightly tangy kick of confettura di ribes (redcurrant jam). You take a bite, and wow, the jam either runs through the middle or sits right on top—giving each forkful a lovely hit of fruity freshness. People up in the mountains, you know, they often have a piece for breakfast with coffee, or just as a snack when they need something filling and sweet.
This cake is comforting and, to be honest, a bit special—perfect for Sunday breakfast or a quick treat with friends. It’s not just tasty but also a fab choice for those on a dolce senza glutine diet since buckwheat is naturally gluten-free. Ideal for gatherings with folks having different dietary needs, which is great. Plus, it stays moist and a bit golden around the edges. Kind of like a mix between a country loaf and a classic cake. In Trentino, you might spot it with confettura di mirtilli rossi (lingonberry jam) for a different taste. But the idea's pretty much the same: the balance between the rich, dense cake and the bright, fresh jam.
No matter how you serve it, this torta rustica feels like a warm hug. It's hearty enough to get you through a cold afternoon—crispy on the edges but with a soft inside that just makes you want more. For sure. Whether it’s a family gathering or just treating yourself, this dessert con grano saraceno brings a bit of the Dolomites right to your table, creating this cozy and inviting vibe for everyone to enjoy.
Before preparing the buckwheat cake with currant jam, ensure to remove the butter, eggs, and milk from the refrigerator at least two hours before making the cake. In the stand mixer, beat the softened butter cut into cubes with half of the granulated sugar ; take the eggs at room temperature, separate the yolks from the whites (keep them as they will be needed later), and add the yolks and the milk gradually .
Split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape the seeds with a knife, adding them to the mixture ; continue with the beaters until you obtain a light and frothy mixture . In a separate bowl, start beating the egg whites (they should be glossy and creamy), and when they turn white, gradually add the remaining half of the sugar you have set aside .
At this point, gently fold the glossy egg whites into the mixture with a spatula, mixing from top to bottom to avoid deflating them . Gradually add the buckwheat flour to the batter , then sift in the baking powder and mix with the spatula to prevent lumps from forming .
Butter and line with parchment paper a 9.5-inch diameter cake pan and pour the batter into it , leveling it well with the spatula . Bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F for 60 minutes (or in a convection oven at 320°F for 50 minutes): if after 30-40 minutes the surface of the cake darkens too much, cover it with a sheet of aluminum foil and continue baking. Check the doneness by inserting a toothpick in the center which, once extracted, should come out dry and clean; otherwise, bake for a few more minutes. Once ready , remove the cake from the oven and from the pan, letting it cool completely on a wire rack.
When the buckwheat cake is completely cool, cut it horizontally into 3 parts with a smooth blade knife (13-14); gently spread the surface of the first layer with the currant jam using a spoon up to the edges (keep a tablespoon from the necessary amount) .
Cover with the second layer and fill again, then finish the cake by placing the last top layer . At this point, you can proceed with the decorations: brush the sides of the cake with the leftover jam
and adhere the sliced almonds around the circumference of the cake . You can decide to decorate the cake with whipped cream: beat the fresh cream with the powdered sugar using an electric mixer (20-21).
With a pastry bag fitted with a star nozzle, create dollops of whipped cream along the perimeter and in the center. Finally, place a red currant on each dollop for an additional touch of color and serve the buckwheat and currant jam cake .
You can store the buckwheat cake with currant jam under a glass dome for a maximum of 2-3 days.
It can be frozen if you have used fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
Buckwheat cake also pairs excellently with other types of jams: raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, and mixed berries ... You are truly spoiled for choice!
