Baked cod au gratin is really one of those go-to Italian dishes. You know, when you want something tender, crispy, and full of Mediterranean goodness. Down in southern Italy—especially along the coast—they whip this up with fresh cod fillets, seasoned breadcrumbs, and extras like capers and anchovies. Super tasty. The whole thing goes into a pan with sliced potatoes and cherry tomatoes, so it feels special but is pretty simple. A drizzle of olive oil—really helps—gets everything golden and bubbling on top, while keeping the inside moist and flaky.
What sets this cod au gratin recipe apart is how fast you can throw it together—no fancy prep here—and hardly any cleanup. It’s really a blend of flavors that shows off the Italian coast. Perfect.
This dish gives you that crispy top without all the fuss. And look, it stays light enough for a weeknight or when friends are over. Folks in the Mediterranean love this stuff because it’s tasty and pretty healthy, using simple ingredients that let the fish shine. Adding capers and anchovies to the breadcrumb crust? It gives a nice salty edge, while the potatoes soak up all the flavors—soft and tasty.
Whether you’re after a baked cod recipe that feels easy or a more traditional cod au gratin , this one really comes through. The mix of veggies and fish makes it a family favorite, and the fact that you just toss it all in one pan? Super low stress. For sure. Some even call it a kind of cod gratin casserole , but the Italian way keeps things light and a bit rustic, skipping the creamy sauce you find elsewhere.
Honestly, all you need is a few fresh ingredients and a little time, and you end up with a dish that’s tender inside, crunchy on top, and full of real Mediterranean vibes. So so good. And you can't go wrong with it.
