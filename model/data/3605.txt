instructions:
First, prepare the vegetables, take the leek and remove the hard green part, then cut the white part in half and slice it into strips that you will then cut into squares ; do the same with the carrot . In a large pan, heat the butter along with the oil, add the leek and carrot and let them soften over low heat for about 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes . When the leek and carrot are softened, remove 2/3 of them and set aside, then add the potatoes to the pot (5-6), allowing them to brown and absorb the flavor along with the remaining leek and carrot.
Add the milk (better if lukewarm as otherwise, it will halt the cooking) until it covers the potatoes and add salt and thyme . Cover the pot with a lid and let it cook on a gentle flame until the potatoes are cooked;
at this point, pass everything through a food mill (or use an immersion blender if you want to make the cream even smoother) and puree it . Then place the puree obtained back into the pot, add the reserved leeks and carrots , then the vegetable stock and season with pepper to your taste. Let it cook on low heat for another 10 minutes, finally add a grating of nutmeg, adjust the salt if necessary, and turn off the heat. Serve the potato cream with vegetables in individual bowls and sprinkle each bowl with a pinch of chives.
For a more indulgent version of the potato cream with vegetables, you can replace part of the vegetable stock with fresh cream.
