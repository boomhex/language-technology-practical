instructions:
To prepare the onion and gorgonzola risotto, first clean and slice the onions to a thickness of about 0.2 inches . Pour a round of oil in the pan , then add the onions and let them brown for a few minutes.
Add a couple of pinches of salt, a ladle of hot water , and cover with the lid . Cook for about 15 minutes or until they are tender but still intact. Cook on low heat, keeping it moist by adding a little hot water as needed. Once cooked, turn off the heat and set aside .
In a large saucepan, heat a pat of butter and a splash of extra virgin olive oil . When the butter has melted, add the rice and let it toast for a couple of minutes, then increase the heat and deglaze the rice with white wine over high heat to quickly evaporate the alcohol.
Add vegetable broth to the rice until it is covered by about an inch and let it heat up. Add the stewed onions to the saucepan , stir and bring the rice to cook by adding more broth as needed .
Adjust salt and pepper just before the end of cooking. Stir in the gorgonzola off the heat and serve the onion and gorgonzola risotto immediately .
It is recommended to consume the risotto immediately. Alternatively, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. Freezing is not recommended.
If you have leftover risotto, you can make delicious little flans: just gratin it in the oven with a sprinkle of Parmesan!
