instructions:
To prepare the chicken bites in an air fryer, first cut the chicken breast in half and clean it from fat and small bones . Cut them into approximately 1-inch pieces and transfer them into a bowl.
Season them with oil , salt, pepper , and lemon zest .
Add the lemon juice as well, mix well , and let marinate in the refrigerator for an hour. After this time, prepare the breading: pour the rustic breadcrumbs and dried oregano into a bowl .
Add the thyme and mix well. Then add the oil and combine. Coat the chicken bites in the breading so they are completely covered .
Place the chicken bites in the air fryer basket , ensuring they are well spaced apart. We used a 6.5-liter air fryer. Cook at 356°F for about 10 minutes or until nicely golden . Transfer to a bowl and if necessary, cook the remaining bites the same way. Serve the chicken bites in the air fryer hot with a fresh salad!
We recommend consuming the chicken bites immediately; alternatively, you can store them in the refrigerator for up to one day.
Enrich the breading with other spices, such as paprika, or add grated cheese. If you can't find rustic breadcrumbs, make them at home by coarsely blending bread with a mixer. Serve the bites with homemade Ketchup Sauce or Mayonnaise .
