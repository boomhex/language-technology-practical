If you’re looking to bring a touch of Rome to your breakfast table, Maritozzi are the sweet Italian buns you need. Seriously good. These tasty treats are a staple in Rome and the Lazio region, known for their incredibly soft texture that practically melts in your mouth. And you know what? What makes these Italian cream buns so special is their unique dough, enriched with pine nuts, raisins, and candied orange peel. After baking, each bun is brushed with a sweet syrup—pretty simple—giving it just the right amount of sticky goodness on the outside. Once cooled, they’re sliced open and generously filled with fluffy whipped cream, making each bite rich and utterly indulgent.
You can find these buns all over Rome, from bustling bakeries to cozy coffee bars. I gotta say, locals will tell you they’re essential for a proper Italian breakfast experience. The Maritozzi recipe stands out because of its strong taste and varied textures, thanks to those delicious extras. Plus, it's the whipped cream filling that elevates these buns from simple to legendary—really, really creamy and light. Romans often enjoy a maritozzo with their morning espresso, but to be honest, these buns are just as satisfying as an afternoon pick-me-up.
These traditional Italian pastries have a rich history, with small variations from one bakery to another—some might add more raisins, while others prefer a heavier dose of orange peel. The vibe? Always indulgent and satisfying. If you’re ever in Lazio, homemade Maritozzi are a must-try, especially for those who appreciate a moist and sweet breakfast. Compared to regular brioche, these buns offer extra flavor with their creamy middle. Whether you're a fan of homemade Maritozzi or just love discovering new Italian breakfast pastries, these buns will transport you straight to a Roman morning, giving you a taste of the region’s culinary magic right at home. Which is great.
To prepare the maritozzi, dissolve the dry yeast (or 12 grams of fresh yeast) in a little warm water , add a teaspoon of malt , and mix well. Place the manitoba flour in a bowl, along with the sugar, forming a well in the center where you will pour the dissolved yeast and malt together , which you will mix slightly with the flour.
In the remaining warm water, add the salt , vegetable oil , and grated lemon zest and mix.
Pour the obtained liquid slowly over the flour and knead with your hands, making wide and quick gestures . Meanwhile, separate the yolks from the egg whites, which you will set aside, and add only the yolks to the dough . Continue kneading for at least 6-7 minutes, until the dough is well-combined.
Meanwhile, soak the raisins in cold water for 10 minutes , squeeze them or let them drain in a colander, and dry them with a cloth. Add the raisins, pine nuts , and candied orange (or the grated zest of 1 orange) to the dough, and continue kneading until the pine nuts, raisins, and orange are absorbed by the dough. Place the maritozzi dough in a floured bowl , covered with plastic wrap, and let it rise for at least 2 hours in a closed and turned-off oven (you can leave the light on to speed up the rising).
When the dough of the maritozzi has doubled in volume , transfer it to a floured work surface and divide it into 12 pieces weighing about 3 oz each (14-15).
Shape each piece into a well-sealed round shape underneath , place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and cover them with plastic wrap , allowing them to rise for another half hour. After this time, give them a slightly elongated shape
and brush them with the egg whites you have set aside . Cover them again with plastic wrap and let them rise for the last time for another hour. Meanwhile, as the maritozzi rise, prepare the sugar syrup for brushing by placing sugar and water in a small saucepan . Dissolve the sugar well until the liquid becomes transparent and let it cool. Now that the maritozzi have finished rising, bake them in a preheated oven at 350°F for 18 minutes.
Whip the cream to stiff peaks in a stand mixer along with the powdered sugar (22-23). When your maritozzi are well golden on the surface, take them out of the oven and while still hot, brush them with the sugar syrup .
Once cooled, make a cut in the center of each maritozzo and fill each with dollops of whipped cream that you have transferred to a piping bag (26-27). Here they are ready to be served (and devoured), your maritozzi!
Once cooked, maritozzi can be stored, without filling, under a glass dome for a couple of days, or they can be frozen individually on a tray to prevent them from sticking together and later transferred to a freezer bag. When ready to serve, just fill them with cream.
If you don't like pine nuts or raisins or candied orange peel, you can omit them in the preparation and make sweet buns. Alternatively, you can use the same amount of sugar instead of malt.
Maritozzi are a typical dessert from Lazio with very ancient origins: they were already present at the time of the Romans as small loaves enriched with honey and raisins, and in the Middle Ages, they were consumed during Lent. The name derives from 'husband' and is linked to two different traditions: the first was that young men would give a maritozzo to their betrothed on the first Friday of March; the second was that girls of marriageable age would prepare the maritozzi: the one who could make the best ones would be courted by the most handsome young men in the village.
