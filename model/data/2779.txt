Crema di fave con scarola e crostoni is a beloved dish from Campania that captures the heart of Italian spring cuisine. Honestly, this fava bean soup combines the sweet taste of fresh fava beans with the slightly bitter, robust flavor of escarole—locally called scarola. Pretty much, it’s the kind of fava bean and escarole soup you'd enjoy in a Neapolitan home, especially during spring when fava beans are really, really at their best. And the crostoni? They’re slices of golden toasted bread, drizzled with top-quality olive oil. Which is great. To enhance the flavors, locals often add crispy pancetta on top, giving you a salty, savory crunch with each bite. Makes the Italian fava bean soup super special.

Rinse the escarole under cold running water and cut it into strips .
Peel the onion and slice it finely . Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan, then add the sliced onion and let it soften over low heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent it from burning. Then add the shelled fava beans ,
the escarole , salt , pepper, and flavor with the mint leaves
cook for a few minutes with the lid on to soften the escarole. Pour in the Vegetable broth and continue cooking with the lid on for 15 minutes or until the vegetables are soft. Once cooked
transfer the vegetables to a tall and narrow container and blend them with the immersion blender until you obtain a thick cream that you will keep warm.
Meanwhile, slice the loaf , place the slices of bread on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, salt them, and drizzle with a little olive oil then toast the slices of bread in a preheated grill oven for 3-4 minutes on both sides until they are golden .
Meanwhile, heat a pan and cook the slices of bacon on both sides over high heat for a minute or until they are crispy , it's not necessary to add seasoning while cooking because the bacon will release its fat. Transfer the cream to a serving dish, garnish it with crispy bacon and accompany it with the toasted bread slices.
