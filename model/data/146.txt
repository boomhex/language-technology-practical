instructions:
To prepare the stuffed anchovies, start with cleaning: under a stream of water, or in a bowl full of water, remove the head , clean the inside and gently widen the opening with your finger .
Remove the central bone , rinse them well and lay them open as a book on a tray. For more details, you can check the page " How to Clean Anchovies ". Now focus on the filling: crumble the bread by hand , then add the grated pecorino cheese .
Add the lemon zest , the juice , and the egg .
Salt, pepper and season with the torn mint leaves . Knead by hand to mix the ingredients well .
Place one anchovy at a time on the work surface with the skin side down, then take a small portion of the filling and press it onto the palm of your hand to spread it out to the same size as the anchovy . Place another anchovy on top of the filling, this time with the skin side up, like a sandwich . Continue in this way with all the other anchovies. Once stuffed, coat the stuffed anchovies by first passing them in flour .
Then dip them in beaten eggs with salt and pepper and finally cover them with breadcrumbs . After breading them, gently press the stuffed anchovies to compact them .
You are ready to fry: heat the oil to a temperature of 340°F and immerse a few pieces at a time . After a few minutes, they will be beautifully golden , then drain on absorbent paper and continue with the cooking of the others . Serve your stuffed anchovies immediately with a squeeze of lemon, if desired !
We recommend consuming the stuffed anchovies immediately.
If you prefer, you can replace the mint with parsley.
