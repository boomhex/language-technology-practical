Messy red rice, or riso rosso pasticciato as they call it in Southern Italy, is the kind of dish that makes a Sunday lunch feel like a real celebration. This classic red rice recipe is all about that flavor. The rice just soaks up the tomato passata , making every bite rich and tangy. Mortadella gives it a strong, almost savory punch—way different from your usual ham. And the cheese? When you add slices of caciocavallo, you get these pockets of gooey, melting goodness. Seriously good.
The top? It is covered in cheese and broiled till crispy and golden. You just might sneak a bite right from the dish—when it’s still hot. Folks in Campania and Puglia sometimes swap in smoked provolone or add a bit of spicy soppressata for an extra kick. But the focus? Always that crispy, cheesy crust on top.
Unlike some rice dishes that are best served super hot, this easy red rice is really something else even when cooled. And people in Southern Italy love packing it up for a picnic. It just gets better. You know, like lasagna that’s sometimes even better the next day. The contrast—tender rice and that crunchy top—keeps every forkful interesting. Really, it’s all about the textures. It never feels boring.
For anyone looking for a homemade red rice that’s got more going on than a basic side, this is it. Pretty simple. Whether you serve it with roast meats, take it to a potluck, or eat leftovers cold, this red rice recipe stands out. It’s not like Mexican red rice or the Southern red rice you might find in the States, but it’s got its own personality— bold , comforting, and always welcome at the table. And here's the thing, it's always a hit, no question.
To prepare messy red rice, start by putting a pot with salted water on the heat for preparing the Vegetable broth . Finely chop the shallot and pour it into a non-stick pan along with the oil; then let it stew over low heat. At this point, add the rice and toast it for a few minutes, stirring often with a spatula or wooden spoon .
Increase the heat and deglaze everything with the white wine . Once all the alcohol has evaporated, add the tomato sauce and mix everything .
Continue cooking by adding a ladle of broth and let almost all the broth absorb before adding more . Then also add the triple tomato concentrate and finish cooking the rice: it will take about 15 minutes.
In the meantime, remove the outer rind from the caciocavallo , cut it into fairly small cubes , then cut the mortadella to the same size .
Once the rice is ready, transfer it to a bowl and add the grated cheese , the caciocavallo, the mortadella , and mix everything to combine all the ingredients .
Grease a baking dish with a drizzle of oil and transfer the freshly prepared mixture, level the surface well with a spatula and cover it with the grated cheese and the caciocavallo also cut into cubes . Bake everything in a preheated oven at 464°F with the grill mode for 6-7 minutes, then take it out and serve your messy red rice while it's still hot !
It is advisable to consume messy red rice as soon as it is prepared; alternatively, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days in an airtight container.
Try replacing the caciocavallo with Emmental instead of caciocavallo, or cooked ham. Use tomato sauce for recipes that require prolonged cooking, and when you want to obtain a creamy and enveloping result, without seeds or large pieces, also add the tomato concentrate to enhance the flavor and the bright, vivid color of the tomato.
