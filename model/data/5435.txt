To make the Greek rice salad, first bring a pot of water to a boil, then salt it and cook the rice for 10 minutes . Meanwhile, prepare the dressing: wash the cucumbers and cut them first into slices and then into cubes .
Wash the cherry tomatoes and quarter them , then halve the olives . Finally, cut the feta into cubes .
In a bowl, combine the cherry tomatoes with the cucumbers , olives , and feta .
Tear the basil leaves with your hands and season with salt, pepper , and a drizzle of oil. Once the rice is cooked, drain it and transfer it to another bowl. Drizzle with a bit of oil and mix, then let it cool.
When the rice has cooled, add the dressing and mix everything well . Your Greek rice salad is ready to be enjoyed !
The Greek rice salad can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days.
If you like, you can substitute basil with mint leaves!
Add salt sparingly because feta is already very salty.
