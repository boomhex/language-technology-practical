To prepare peppers with breadcrumbs, wash and dry the peppers well, cut them in half, remove the stem and internal seeds, then cut them into strips 1 inch wide . Cook the peppers in a pot with plenty of extra virgin olive oil for 15-20 minutes . Meanwhile, prepare the breadcrumb mixture: use a mixer to grind the stale bread ,
then transfer it to a bowl and add the grated pecorino cheese , the capers , one clove of minced garlic and
the oregano . Mix well to combine all the ingredients, then add the mixture to the peppers and cook for 20 minutes over medium heat, covering with a lid. When the peppers are almost ready, remove the lid and let everything cook, increasing the heat to toast the bread . The peppers with breadcrumbs are ready: let them cool slightly and serve as a side dish or a tasty appetizer; they are also excellent served cold.
Store the peppers with breadcrumbs in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to 2 days.
If desired, you can substitute the stale bread with ready-made breadcrumbs. If you want to give a stronger flavor to this recipe, you can add a larger amount of pecorino cheese. If you like, you can add olives to this preparation: they will further enhance the flavor of your peppers.
