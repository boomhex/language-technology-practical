letting it cook until the meat is well red and crispy . Then reduce the stracchino to a cream with the help of a spoon and transfer the cheese into a pastry bag. Finally, squeeze the cream onto the classic pastries "La Bottega di Olivia&Marino" and finish by placing two cubes of crispy luganega on top of each pastry .
