To prepare the cake in a jar, start with the lemon sponge cake. Separate the yolks from the egg whites and beat them with the electric whisks with 3 tbsps of sugar . Add the honey and continue until they become pale and very frothy, and flavor with the lemon zest .
Beat the egg whites to soft peaks with the remaining sugar , so that no lumps form when you combine them with the other ingredients, then gently combine the two mixtures with a spatula without deflating them . Add the sifted flour and mix it into the batter.
Spread the mixture on a baking sheet of dimensions 14x11 inches lined with parchment paper, and level it with a flat, smooth spatula . Bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for 5 minutes; the surface of the cake should become just golden, and you should never open the oven (which will retain moisture) during baking. Then remove the sponge cake from the oven and let it cool. Meanwhile, prepare the chocolate sponge cake: separate the yolks from the egg whites and beat the yolks with the honey
and half of the sugar . Beat the yolks until they become pale and very frothy . Also beat the egg whites to soft peaks with the remaining sugar, then gently combine the two mixtures with a spatula without deflating them .
Add the sifted flour together with the cocoa powder and mix the batter gently. Spread on a baking sheet of dimensions 14x11 inches lined with parchment paper . Bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for 5 minutes. Remove the sponge cake from the oven and let it cool.
Meanwhile, prepare the cream: blend the raspberries in the mixer (16-17), sift the obtained sauce to remove the seeds and collect it in a bowl with the yogurt ,
mix with the whisk to combine the ingredients and then add half of the powdered sugar . Separately whip the fresh cream and add the other half of the powdered sugar .
Fold the whipped cream into the raspberry cream and mix gently . Then take a cookie cutter with a diameter of 2.75 inches and cut out 4 discs from the lemon sponge cake and 8 from the chocolate one .
To assemble the cake, use glass jars with a capacity of 7 oz: transfer the cream into a piping bag with a plain tip and form a layer of cream, then place a chocolate disc on top , then another layer of cream and place another lemon sponge cake disc on top ,
continue with another layer of cream, a cocoa sponge cake disc and finish with cream, leaving 0.4 inches from the edge. Decorate with fresh raspberries and dark chocolate curls . Your cake in a jar is thus ready to be enjoyed!
Store the cake in a jar in the refrigerator for a maximum of 2-3 days covered with clear plastic wrap.
You can freeze it if you have used fresh ingredients.
You can prepare the sponge cake in advance and store it under a glass dome for a couple of days while waiting to assemble the cake.
To make the cake in a jar, you can use the classic vanilla-flavored sponge cake. The yogurt cream is a fresh and tasty filling; if you don't like raspberries, you can replace them with other seasonal fruits of your choice, such as peaches, apricots, or strawberries.
