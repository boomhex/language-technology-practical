Sfoglie classiche con purea di fave is a dish that really, really brings the heart of springtime from central Italy. We're talking about those beautiful regions of Toscana and Lazio .

You’ll often find them right in the middle of an aperitivo spread, alongside other classic Italian recipes . They might look fancy, but trust me, their taste is warm and inviting.
The flavor is all about fresh fava beans mashed until super smooth and mixed with olive oil for that moist touch. What's memorable about these bites is the blend of tender fava spread, slices of salty salame, and a sprinkle of sharp pecorino cheese. It's like having a little piece of spring in each bite. So, so good! The flavors balance those rich and tangy notes perfectly, thanks to those beloved Italian ingredients.
These appetizers are just great for any casual gathering. Seriously. They offer a taste that's special yet approachable. In Toscana , folks might add a drizzle of olive oil or a few fresh herbs. And here's the thing—in Lazio , they pile on extra pecorino, embracing that bold cheese flavor. The golden pastry? It stays crispy for hours, making them ideal for setting out early at your event. Guests can grab a bite whenever, making these snacks perfect companions for a glass of wine or a relaxed chat around the table.
If you're looking to spice up your snack spread, these sfoglie show what traditional Italian dishes are all about—fresh ingredients, simple ideas, and flavors that harmonize beautifully.

To prepare classic puff pastries with fava bean puree, start by washing the fava beans, then shell them from their pod and extract the seeds , then remove the outgrowth covering the fava bean seed. At this point, cook the fava beans in plenty of boiling water for at least 5 minutes and set aside a few ladles of cooking water.
Drain them and pour them into a bowl, add a ladle of filtered cooking water and blend the fava beans , adding more cooking water if necessary to adjust the consistency of the cream, which should be quite thick. Once the cream is ready, add salt and a tablespoon of olive oil .
Separately, cut the pecorino cheese into pieces and the slices of Felino salami into cubes . Now you can assemble your appetizers: put the fava bean cream in a piping bag and spread it on each pastry , finally garnish with the pecorino pieces and salami cubes.
