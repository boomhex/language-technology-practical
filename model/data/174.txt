instructions:
To prepare the panna cotta with peach coulis, first soak the gelatin sheets in water. In a saucepan, pour the fresh cream, add the sugar , vanilla seeds , and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and add the well-drained gelatin .
Stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Fill 5 dome molds with a diameter of 3 inches and let them rest in the fridge for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight. Cut the peaches into pieces .
Place them in a pot , add the sugar, water, and cook over high heat for 10 minutes or until the peaches are very soft . Blend with an immersion blender .
Pass everything through a sieve to obtain a creamy coulis , then let it rest in the refrigerator until ready to use. Cut the peaches into slices about 1/4 inch thick .
Sprinkle the sugar on the bottom of a pan , lay the peach slices on top and caramelize on both sides over medium heat for 3 minutes .
For plating, place the peach coulis at the bottom , lay the panna cotta on top , and finish with a slice of caramelized peach . Your panna cotta with peach coulis is ready to be enjoyed!
The panna cotta with peach coulis can be perfectly stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. The peach coulis can also be prepared in advance and stored separately in the fridge, in a jar with a lid, for up to 4 days.
You can substitute peaches with apricots, strawberries, raspberries, mango, or any fruit suitable for turning into coulis, adjusting the amount of sugar based on the sweetness of the fruit. For a more original note, flavor the cream with lemon or orange zest or a pinch of cardamom, or add fresh ginger to the coulis for a more lively contrast.
