Ravioli stuffed with cockerel? Oh, it's something special, I promise. This dish really brings out the heart of Northern Italian cooking where rustic and tender flavors really shine. It's not just any stuffed pasta with chicken . Nope, the filling is made special by simmering young rooster meat, or galletto, in beer. Yeah, beer. It makes the meat moist and full of aromatic notes. Really stands out from your average chicken ravioli recipe .
The pasta? It's got that homemade magic, using fresh eggs for a rich, golden bite. Wrapped in those golden sheets, you'll discover a filling that's all about depth and comfort, with a touch of Grana Padano cheese giving it a little extra oomph—seriously good stuff. Folks in Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna might sometimes swap in chicken or guinea fowl, but honestly, the idea stays the same. Use local, high-quality ingredients. Keep it simple, keep it flavorful.
Here's the thing: in Northern Italy, dishes like this are often served for Sunday lunches or special occasions. Which is great. Makes them feel special, you know? The butter and sage sauce? Classic move. Just enough to coat the homemade ravioli with chicken and let that filling shine without being heavy. Those tender bites are rich, a bit savory, and just the right amount of herby from the sage. It’s the kind of meal that makes you slow down. Really enjoy it.
Some families? They toss in a touch more Grana Padano on top, which melts right in—comfort food to the max. People who love trying out traditional ravioli recipes or are on the hunt for new ravioli filling ideas will get a kick out of how the beer-cooked rooster brings out something different from regular chicken. It is got those Italian roots but, to be honest, throws in a fun twist. Makes it a dish that stands out when you want something old-school yet a bit original. It's a perfect example of how regional ingredients can create something really, really special and memorable. For sure.

To prepare the capon stuffed ravioli, start by placing the flour in a mound on a work surface and put the eggs in the center . Add a pinch of salt and gradually incorporate the flour using a fork .
Then knead with your hands until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in a cool, dry place for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the celery into small cubes .
Finely chop the onion and carrots as well. In a pot, pour a drizzle of oil and add the vegetables .
Add two crushed garlic cloves with their skins and a sprig of thyme and rosemary . Sauté over low heat for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Meanwhile, cut the capon into pieces .
Add the pieces of capon to the pot and brown each side until golden . Pour the beer into the pot .
Adjust with salt and pepper . Cover with a lid and let it cook for about 1 hour or until the meat can be easily shredded.
Remove the meat from the pot and let it cool a bit. Then shred the meat , removing skin and bones, and transfer it to a bowl. Add the cooking juices, vegetables , and Parmesan .
Mix until you get a homogeneous mixture. Let it cool completely and put everything in a pastry bag. Take the dough and divide it in half . Roll out the sheets using a pasta machine. Start with the thickest setting, then fold the ends of the sheet towards the center . Pass it through the rollers again, gradually reducing the thickness.
Proceed in this way until you get 2 sheets with a thickness of 2-3 mm . Brush one sheet with water and place dollops of filling about 1 1/2 inches apart .
Cover with the second sheet . Try to remove the air around the filling and make sure the two sheets adhere well so the ravioli won't open during cooking. Use a pastry cutter to shape your ravioli . Cook them in salted boiling water for 3-4 minutes until they float to the surface.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan and add the sage leaves . Drain the ravioli and transfer them to the pan , sauté gently for a few minutes. Plate and add the melted butter .
Finish with a sprinkle of Parmesan , a few sage leaves , and freshly ground pepper. Your capon stuffed ravioli are ready to be served !
Capon stuffed ravioli can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days at most.
You can freeze the uncooked ravioli by placing them on a tray well-spaced, then once they are firm, transfer them to a freezer bag.
At the time of cooking, simply cook them directly in boiling water without defrosting.
For a more intense flavor, use dark or craft beer.
As an alternative to capon, you can use chicken or duck to create a similar filling with different nuances.
