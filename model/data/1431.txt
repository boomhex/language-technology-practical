Lemon amaretti cookies really bring a fantastic Italian twist to your tea break with their zesty, citrusy flavor. These cookies take the traditional amaretti and give them a fresh makeover by adding a whole lot of lemon. You get a soft, almost moist interior, while keeping that classic, slightly crunchy exterior. In Italy, especially in the northern regions, these cookies are a big favorite with tea or even chilled drinks during the warmer months.
And the aroma? Seriously good. The combination of nutty almonds and sharp lemon fills the kitchen—no question. People love how these soft lemon amaretti keep things simple yet super flavorful. Thing is, the ingredient list is short, focusing on quality. The lemon flavor isn’t just in the dough—a sprinkle of zest on top gives a zippy finish that really lingers.
If you’re looking for something chewy, not overly sweet, and full of authentic taste, the lemon amaretti recipe is perfect. For sure. These cookies often show up in Italian homes on big trays during family gatherings, but they’re just as great as an afternoon snack or even a breakfast treat with coffee. Compared to the usual amaretti, the lemon version is brighter and feels way, way lighter.
Some folks in Italy even switch things up with a bit of orange zest or a splash of limoncello for an extra kick. And listen, the lemon amaretti cookies focus on that tender crumb and zesty flavor. Plus, they’re naturally gluten-free, so you’ll often see them labeled as gluten-free lemon cookies in blogs and bakeries. Whether paired with strong black tea in winter or something refreshing in summer, these amaretti biscuits bring a touch of Italian homemade sweetness to any occasion. It’s all about enjoying good food, a nice drink, and the simple joy that comes with sharing a delicious moment together. Pretty simple.
To make the lemon amaretti, first place the whole unpeeled almonds in a food processor with blades , add the sugar , and blend until the mixture is powdered .
Grate the zest of 3 untreated lemons . Transfer the ground almonds into a bowl, add the lemon zest , the egg whites
and the bitter almond essence . Start gathering the ingredients with a spatula and, when the liquids are absorbed, continue kneading by hand .
When the dough is well mixed, take a small portion of 0.7 oz and shape it into a round form. As you make the balls, place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper . Cover the amaretti with plenty of powdered sugar, distributing it with a sieve .
With the indicated doses, you will get about 24 amaretti . Bake the amaretti in a preheated static oven at 320°F for 40 minutes. Once cooked, remove the lemon amaretti from the oven and let them cool slightly before enjoying them !
Store the amaretti in a glass jar or a tin can and consume them within a week. Freezing the dough is not recommended; however, it is possible to freeze the raw formed cookies and place them on a tray, well-spaced.
Enrich a tray of small sweets to enjoy at tea time with lemon amaretti, Biscotti esse , Baci di dama (Hazelnut cookies) , Butter and jam cookies , and other delicious shortbreads!
