Falsomagro is one of those bold Sicilian dishes that, to be honest, really brings the family together. I mean, everyone gathers around the table for this one.

Picture a big, tender roll of beef stuffed with all kinds of goodies—ground meat, pecorino , breadcrumbs, mortadella, lardo, caciocavallo, and yes, even boiled eggs for a surprise in each slice. So delicious.
The whole thing gets wrapped up tight, tied with string, and cooked in this rich, flavorful sauce. People love to mop it up with bread. Can’t go wrong there. Every city in Sicily adds its own twist to the filling, so you’ll never taste the exact same flavor twice—sometimes more cheese, sometimes a bit of ham, maybe even a touch more moist filling. Really depends on whose nonna is making it.
The name "falsomagro" comes from the idea that it looks lean from the outside, but once you cut in, it’s packed with all sorts of bold and juicy stuff. Honestly, it’s a fun surprise.

Whether you’re in Palermo or Catania, people in Sicily know how to celebrate with food, and this stuffed meat roll is one of the best reasons to gather everyone for a long, happy meal.
Sharing stories and laughter over a dish like falsomagro—seriously good—makes any occasion feel like a true feast. It’s bringing a little bit of Sicily to every table.
To prepare the falsomagro, start by hard-boiling the eggs in a pot full of water , then take the slice of beef and pound it well with a meat mallet, to ensure even thickness . Slice the mortadella ,
the lard and the caciocavallo into strips about 1/4 inch thick, then set everything aside. In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, the grated cheese
and the breadcrumbs , then mix well with your hands . Adjust with salt and pepper, then place the mixture on the beef slice , making sure to spread it well and leave about 3/4 inch of border on each side to prevent the filling from spilling out when rolling the meat.
Now position the lard, mortadella, and caciocavallo alternately , then place the hard-boiled eggs in the center , previously cooled and peeled.
Close the falsomagro by rolling the meat onto itself; to seal it, use kitchen twine, as shown in the figures (13-14-15) (for more details on how to tie a roast click here ).
Brown the meat in a pan with a little oil , making sure to sear it well on all sides. Meanwhile, prepare a mixture of celery, onion, and carrot, and sauté it in a non-stick pan with two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, for a few minutes over low heat . Once the falsomagro is browned, add it to the sauté , continuing to cook over medium heat;
after a couple of minutes, deglaze with the red wine . Then add the tomato sauce , a tablespoon of triple-concentrated tomato paste, salt, and pepper. Cover with a lid and let the falsomagro cook over low heat for 60 minutes, occasionally turning it for even cooking. After this time, check that the falsomagro is done by piercing it with a fork: the meat should be tender.
Turn off the heat, remove the meat, and place it on a cutting board to remove the twine and cut it into slices . Serve the falsomagro on a serving dish, accompanied by its sauce.
Store the falsomagro in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. You can freeze the filled and tied falsomagro, already cooked (as long as no defrosted ingredients were used). To defrost, place it in the refrigerator the night before and, once defrosted, reheat it in a pan or oven.
If you wish, you can use sliced mortadella and lard instead of strips. Other versions of this recipe include the use of salami, sausage, or bacon.
