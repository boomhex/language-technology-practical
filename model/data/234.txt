instructions:
To prepare the green bean, potato, and stracchino bake, start by peeling the potatoes and slicing them thinly ; then trim the green beans .
Plunge the potatoes and green beans into salted boiling water and blanch for 10 minutes . Drain and let cool slightly . Meanwhile, prepare the stracchino cream: gather the stracchino and cream in a jug .
Add salt, pepper, and a handful of basil leaves for fragrance , drizzle with oil , and blend with an immersion blender .
You will obtain a compact sauce . Pour a spoonful at the bottom of a 10x7 inch baking dish and create the first layer by adding about half of the potatoes and green beans .
Drizzle with a bit of oil and a pinch of salt and cover with plenty of stracchino cream , spreading it carefully over the entire surface. Cover with half of the grated cheese .
Repeat with another layer: potatoes and green beans , making sure to arrange the latter neatly and press them lightly with the back of a spoon, then again with stracchino cream, the remaining grated cheese, some almond flakes, a drizzle of oil, and a grind of pepper . Bake in a preheated static oven at 430°F for about 20 minutes. Let it set slightly, then finish with fresh basil before serving your green bean, potato, and stracchino bake .
The green bean, potato, and stracchino bake can be stored in the fridge covered for 2 days and can be frozen either raw or cooked.
You can personalize your green bean, potato, and stracchino bake by trying to replace the green beans with asparagus or snow peas. For a lighter version, use milk instead of cream.
