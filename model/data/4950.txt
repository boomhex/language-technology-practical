To prepare the champagne risotto, place 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan , add the finely chopped onion and let it turn golden; sprinkle in the rice and toast it for a few moments over high heat, stirring with a wooden spoon.
Then pour all the Champagne into the saucepan ; stir the rice continuously so that it doesn't stick to the bottom and if necessary, add a few ladles of vegetable broth to finish cooking. A few moments before the end of cooking, turn off the heat and stir in the remaining butter and the Grana Padano DOP. Serve the champagne risotto while still hot, accompanied by a flute of the same champagne used for cooking.
