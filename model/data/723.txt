instructions:
To make Apulian focaccia with onions, first boil the potatoes starting from cold water for about 30 minutes or until they are soft enough to pierce with a fork . Once cooked, peel the potatoes and mash them with a fork . Let them cool slightly and, in the meantime, pour the semolina and all-purpose flour into a bowl .
Add the dried yeast and sugar , then make a well in the center and add the mashed potatoes .
Pour the water in gradually while mixing with your hands to absorb it . Once you have a smooth and homogeneous mixture, add the salt and work it in uniformly.
Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and stretch it with your fingers to form a rectangle , then proceed with the folds: fold the top edge towards the center , then fold the bottom edge and overlap it .
Do the same with the lateral edges , then flip the dough and round it off by turning it on the surface with your hands .
Cover the dough with a bowl and let it rest for 30 minutes , then repeat a set of folds. Flip the dough again, round it off, and place it in an oiled bowl . Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise away from drafts for about 3 hours or until it doubles in volume .
After the rising time, pour the dough into an oiled 12x16 inch pan . Stretch the dough gently with oiled hands and let it rest for another hour. Meanwhile, clean and slice the onions into thin rings .
After this time, pour the oil over the focaccia and press your fingertips into the dough to create the usual dimples , then add coarse salt .
Spread the onion rings evenly over the surface , then add the olives and drizzle with a little more oil. Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 30 minutes. When it's nicely golden, remove from the oven and enjoy your Apulian focaccia with onions !
Apulian focaccia with onions can be stored at room temperature for about 3 days.
You can freeze it after it has been cooked and completely cooled.
You can enrich the topping by adding anchovy fillets on the surface!
