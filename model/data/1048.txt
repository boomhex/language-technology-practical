instructions:
To prepare the pakora, start by peeling the potato , wash it, and cut it into cubes . Then peel the carrot and cut it into diagonal slices .
Cook the vegetables in boiling salted water for 5 minutes and then drain them . Meanwhile, peel the red onion, slice it, and separate the rings two by two .
Now prepare the batter. Sift the chickpea flour into a bowl and add a pinch of baking powder for savory pies , then add a fresh chili pepper, seeded and chopped , a bunch of chopped cilantro ,
the spicy Madras curry , and a pinch of salt . Dilute with well-chilled sparkling water, stirring with a whisk ,
to achieve a fairly fluid and smooth batter . Heat plenty of seed oil in a pan and meanwhile dip the prepared vegetables in the batter . Immerse a few pieces at a time and then gradually drop them into the pan .
Repeatedly baste them with the oil using a spoon then turn the fritters and repeat the process . When the pakora is golden, drain it on absorbent paper and continue this way until all the ingredients are used up. Finally, accompany as desired with chapati bread and mango chutney .
Once the pakora is ready, it is recommended to consume it immediately.
If you want crunchier pakora, prepare the batter with 250g of chickpea flour and 50g of rice flour!
