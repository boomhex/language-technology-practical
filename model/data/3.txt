To prepare your gingerbread tart, start with the shortcrust pastry: gather the flour and brown sugar in a bowl, then add the unsweetened cocoa powder which will give color and aroma to the dough . Add the cubed butter and the egg .
Also, add the honey , baking soda , and nutmeg .
Finally, flavor with the cinnamon and ginger powder . Start mixing the ingredients with a spoon or with a stand mixer paddle, then continue working with your fingertips.
When you have obtained a rough mixture , transfer it to the work surface and compact it with your hands , then flatten it slightly and wrap it in cling film. Let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours .
After the resting time, take the dough out, sprinkle the work surface with flour , and roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 1/6 - 1/5 inch . Cut out a disc slightly larger than the tart pan and gently roll it onto the rolling pin, then place it inside a 10-inch removable bottom tart pan .
Adhere the dough well to the edges and trim the excess . Prick the base with a fork to prevent it from swelling during baking and bake it in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 30 minutes, on the lower rack. Once cooked, take it out and let it cool. In the meantime, roll out the leftover dough again to a thickness of 1/6 - 1/5 inch and cut out gingerbread men using the appropriate cookie cutter .
Also, create other shapes as desired, such as snowflakes and stars, using cookie cutters of different sizes . Transfer the cookies to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a static oven at 350°F for 10-12 minutes. While the cookies bake, prepare the royal icing by pouring the icing sugar and egg white into a bowl .
Add a few drops of lemon and turn on the electric beaters until you get a white, shiny, and compact cream ; it will take about 5-10 minutes.
Move on to the ganache: in a saucepan, heat the cream with a pinch of salt . Coarsely chop the dark chocolate and add it to the hot cream as soon as it reaches a boil .
Stir with a whisk until the chocolate is completely melted and the ganache is smooth and velvety . Now recover the tart base that has cooled .
Fill the shortcrust shell with the jam , leveling it with a spoon. Pour the hot ganache on top , letting it drip and then gently leveling it .
Place the tart in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to firm up. In the meantime, decorate the baked and cooled cookies with the icing, drawing outlines, buttons, lines, and snowflakes according to your imagination ; let them dry at room temperature .
After the tart has firmed up , decorate it by arranging the cookies on the surface in a semicircle . Complete with cinnamon sticks, star anise, and sprinkles for a scenic and fragrant touch. Your gingerbread tart is ready to be served !
The gingerbread tart can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
You can prepare the shortcrust pastry in advance and freeze it.
For a Christmas-scented ganache, infuse star anise in the cream and remove it before adding the chocolate.
Try flavoring the shortcrust pastry with a pinch of ground cardamom, perfect in combination with cinnamon and ginger.
It's important to pour the ganache into the shortcrust shell while it is still hot, otherwise, it will tend to thicken and be more difficult to spread evenly.
