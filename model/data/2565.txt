So, if you're looking for something unique and tasty, these financiers are sure to be a hit. Can't go wrong.
To prepare the walnut financiers with peach jam, melt the butter over low heat in a large pan , stirring with a wooden spoon until it turns dark: this will create brown butter, which is melted butter toasted to a hazelnut color to acquire a very particular aroma. Strain the brown butter into a small bowl with the help of a fine-mesh sieve and let it cool. Toast the walnuts at 350°F (180°C) for 3-4 minutes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper ;
In a food processor, place the toasted walnuts and half the sugar , which will help absorb the oil released by the walnuts during grinding. Pulse intermittently (to prevent the walnuts from overheating) to obtain a flour . Add the almond flour to the mixer ,
the all-purpose flour , honey , and then the cold (or at most slightly warm) brown butter .
Pulse the mixer to create a homogeneous mixture and then transfer the batter into a bowl. In a separate container, separate the yolks from the egg whites, beating the latter with a pinch of salt : when the mixture becomes white and foamy, you can add the remaining sugar .
Add a small amount of the whipped egg whites and mix with a spatula to soften the mixture; then add the remaining egg whites, mixing from the bottom up to avoid deflating them , until the mixture is smooth and homogeneous .
Place the batter in a piping bag without a nozzle, cutting a hole . Butter 8 rectangular molds measuring 3x2x1.5 inches (8x5.5x4 cm) and then fill them ¾ full with about 3.4 oz (95 g) of batter . Once finished , bake the financiers in a preheated static oven at 340°F (170°C) for 25 minutes (or 300°F (150°C) for 15 minutes if using a convection oven).
When the financiers are ready , take them out of the oven and let them cool slightly; then demold them and let them cool completely on a wire rack . Prepare the whipped cream: for this, it's important that the cream and all tools are well chilled, so you can place them in the refrigerator a few minutes before starting. Pour the fresh cream into the bowl and beat it with the whisk, rotating always in the same direction.
Once ready , place it in a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle. After the necessary time, you can fill the financiers: make a small vertical cut along the long side without reaching the bottom, then gently open the treats ; with a teaspoon, fill the inside with peach jam (you can also use a piping bag without a nozzle, cutting a hole).
Garnish the top of the financiers with whipped cream (covering the filling slit) and finish by distributing the slivered almonds : your walnut financiers with peach jam are ready to be served .
You can store the financiers (without whipped cream) under a glass dome for a maximum of 1-2 days. If you have leftover, you can store the whipped cream for up to one day in a container or covered with plastic wrap.
Peaches, apricots, apples, or berries: fill your financiers with your favorite jam! Toasted walnut flour will give a more intense taste to the batter, but if you prefer, you can use regular walnut flour.
