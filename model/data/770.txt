Pollo e patate, or chicken and mashed potatoes the Italian way, is what makes Sunday dinners feel cozy and laid-back. Not your usual roast and baked potatoes, this one uses juicy chicken thighs, or sovracosce —really good stuff—which get pan-cooked until tender and packed with flavor. And here's the thing, there's this homey trick: as the chicken cooks, it's brushed with oil warmed with garlic and herbs. Super tasty. It's simple, but it gives the chicken a really moist and savory taste. When the chicken's ready, it's placed on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes —smoother than your usual rustic mash. These potatoes soak up all the delicious pan juices, making every bite so so comforting, like a classic chicken mashed potato bowl but with that Italian touch.
When Italians want something straightforward yet rich and satisfying, this kind of chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy is the go-to, especially for family gatherings. Sometimes folks switch the chicken cut, or they might try it with onions and roasted potatoes for a different vibe, but the essence stays the same—chill and welcoming. Pretty much. It's all about gathering, passing plates of fluffy potatoes and juicy chicken, and not stressing over making it fancy. The mashed potatoes act like a soft pillow for the chicken, and honestly, the whole thing is one of those family dinner ideas you just keep coming back to. No question. It's easy to see why so many Italian households have this on repeat. Whether you're looking for a break from the usual baked chicken and mashed potatoes or just want something that feels classic yet fresh, this homemade twist is a sure thing for any night when you want food that feels like home. And you know what, it's a fantastic way to enjoy a meal that's simple yet incredibly satisfying, making it a true favorite in Italian kitchens.

To prepare the chicken and mashed potatoes, first boil the potatoes starting from cold water for about 35-40 minutes, or until they are soft enough to be easily pierced with a fork . Meanwhile, take the chicken thighs, season both sides with oil and salt, then massage the meat with your hands . Let it rest for 10 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the flavored oil: finely chop a clove of garlic , then add a pinch of salt and crush it with the knife blade to obtain a sort of paste. Finely chop the aromatic herbs as well, keeping one sprig of rosemary aside .
Pour the oil into a bowl, then add the garlic and herbs and stir with the rosemary sprig, which will be used to brush the meat .
Place the thighs skin-side down in a warm pan and brown over medium heat for 10 minutes, occasionally brushing with the flavored oil . While the chicken is cooking, focus on the mashed potatoes: pour the milk into a saucepan, season with the 2 crushed garlic cloves in their skins and some aromatic herbs , and bring to just below boiling.
Peele the cooked potatoes roughly and pass them through a potato ricer while still hot . Add the milk little by little, filtering it through a sieve , and mix well with a hand whisk ; adjust the amount of milk based on the consistency you want to achieve.
At this point, add the butter , the grated Parmigiano Reggiano DOP , and the egg yolks .
Stir again to combine everything and keep warm. After 10 minutes of cooking, you'll see that the skin has become nice and crispy, so flip the thighs and cook for another 5 minutes .
When the meat is cooked, you can plate: spread a bed of mashed potatoes at the base of the plate and place a thigh on top . Drizzle with the cooking juices, then garnish with flakes of salt, pepper, and a few thyme leaves. Your chicken and mashed potatoes are ready to be served !
The chicken and mashed potatoes can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
We chose to use thighs because they remain juicier: browning them at a not too high temperature will cause them to lose some of their fat, and the skin will become nice and crispy!
Adding egg yolks results in a richer and more intensely colored mashed potato, but you can omit them if you prefer.
You can vary the mix of aromatic herbs to your liking!
