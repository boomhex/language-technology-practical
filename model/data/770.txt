instructions:
To prepare the hemp cookies with almond milk, pour the flour and cubed butter into the bowl of a stand mixer . Work the ingredients with the paddle attachment until you get a sandy mixture. Add the brown sugar to the mixture and work for a couple more minutes, then pour in the almond milk .
Work the ingredients until you get a soft dough . Divide the dough into two equal parts, each weighing 15 oz. Add almond flour to one of the doughs and hemp flour to the other .
Work the doughs by hand, incorporating the added flours until you get two homogeneous doughs . Transfer the doughs to the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Lightly flour the work surface and, with a rolling pin, roll out the two doughs to about 1/4 inch thick .
You should obtain two sheets of similar size . Place the hemp dough on top of the almond one using the rolling pin. Remove the excess dough .

Gently roll the dough from the long side to obtain a log about 2 inches in diameter . Cut the log into two parts to facilitate moving, and transfer the log to the freezer for 30 minutes .
Remove the log from the freezer and cut slices about 1/2 inch thick . Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 15 minutes, on the middle rack. Remove from the oven and let the hemp cookies with almond milk cool before serving .
Hemp cookies with almond milk can be stored in a tin box for a week. You can freeze the raw dough.
The chilling step is essential because it allows the cookies to hold their shape better after cutting.
