instructions:
To make the eggless tart, first prepare the crust: pour the flour and cold butter from the fridge into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment , add the salt and vanilla extract , and mix for 3 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the brown sugar with water in a small bowl .
Add the water and sugar mixture to the stand mixer and turn it on again until you get a compact and homogeneous dough . Transfer the dough to the work surface and form a loaf, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes .
After the resting time, roll out the shortcrust on the lightly floured surface to a thickness of about half a centimeter (about 1/4 inch). Place a mold with a diameter of 28 cm (11 inches) measured on the surface (27 cm at the base) on the shortcrust and cut the corresponding portion leaving a small margin from the edge . Line the base and edges of the mold with the disc of shortcrust and remove the excess dough with a small knife .
Fill the shortcrust shell with jam , spreading it evenly with the back of a spoon . At this point, roll out the leftover shortcrust again to a thickness of half a centimeter .
With a knife, cut strips about 1 cm (0.4 inches) wide and place them on the tart in both directions , then remove the excess by rolling the rolling pin along the edges of the mold .
Bake in a preheated static oven at 180°C (356°F) for 30 minutes, placing the mold on the middle shelf . Once baked, remove the tart from the oven and let it cool before removing it from the mold . Your eggless tart is ready to be served !
The eggless tart can be stored at room temperature for 3 days, covered with a dome. The eggless shortcrust pastry can be stored for 3 days in the refrigerator, wrapped in plastic wrap. Alternatively, you can freeze the loaf for a maximum of one month.
If instead of jam you prefer to fill the eggless tart with cream and fresh fruit, you can pierce the shortcrust shell and proceed with How to do blind baking for 15-20 minutes!
