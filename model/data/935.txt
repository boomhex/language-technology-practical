That’s all thanks to creamy ricotta cheese—giving it a light and airy crumb—while fresh pears add a sweet and natural vibe. In Italy, they call it "ciambella," and it comes in many forms. Some have cacao , or maybe orange, lemon, and sometimes it’s made without eggs. Pretty simple. The batter’s easy to whip up with just a whisk, even if you’re not a regular baker. And the flavor? Fragrant and comforting, with the mellow taste of ripe pears. Honestly, for anyone wanting an easy homemade cake, this Italian pear cake feels like a warm hug from Nonna.

You’ll find it at Italian breakfast tables, but it’s just as great for dessert or a sweet snack.
