the fresh oregano leaves , salt, pepper, and mix everything . In another bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt. At this point, heat plenty of oil, it should reach a temperature of 340°F. In the meantime, make the cutlets: dip the fennel slices first in the egg ,
then in the breadcrumbs and arrange them on a tray . As soon as the oil reaches the right temperature, fry the cutlets 1-2 at a time .
After 1-2 minutes, when they are golden brown, drain them and transfer them to a tray lined with paper towels to remove the excess oil . As soon as you have finished frying them, transfer them to a serving dish and serve the fennel cutlets hot .
