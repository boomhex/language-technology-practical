instructions:
To prepare the almond milk and chocolate chip muffins, put the softened butter in a large bowl, add the sugar , and mix with an electric mixer until you get a thick and creamy mixture. Add one egg at a time
and incorporate it into the batter with the electric mixer ; wait for each egg to be fully combined before adding another. Pour in the sifted flour , the baking powder ,
the vanilla extract , and the almond milk , and mix everything with the electric mixer .
At this point, add almost all the chocolate chips and mix with a spatula to incorporate them evenly into the batter ; the rest of the chocolate chips will be used to garnish the muffins. Transfer the batter into a piping bag without a nozzle.
Line the muffin tin with paper liners and fill them with the batter about three-quarters full . Decorate the surface with the chocolate chips you set aside and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 20 minutes. After the baking time, perform the toothpick test and remove your delicious almond milk and chocolate chip muffins from the oven !
The almond milk and chocolate chip muffins can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days, in a food bag or wrapped in aluminum foil. They can be frozen after baking.
To make the batter even more fragrant, you can add 5 drops of almond essence!
