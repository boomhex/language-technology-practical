instructions:
To prepare split pea soup, start by soaking the split peas in plenty of cold water and leave them for at least 3 hours. Finely chop the carrot, celery, and onion and sauté them with the garlic in extra virgin olive oil in a large pot . Sauté for about 10 minutes and then add the diced bacon (if you prefer, you can add the bacon in one slice) and let it brown well. Rinse the peas well under cold running water .
and add them to the pot , stir to season them, then cover the peas with hot vegetable broth . Cover the soup and let it cook over low heat (it should simmer slightly) until the peas are very tender and begin to fall apart, which will take about 60 minutes. If you want to make the dish more substantial, you can add pasta (ditalini, broken spaghetti, etc.) or rice to the soup!
