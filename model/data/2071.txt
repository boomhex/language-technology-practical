To make the pound cake, start by melting the butter in the microwave or a bain-marie and set it aside to cool slightly. Meanwhile, pour the eggs into a bowl, add the sugar , and flavor the mixture with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (alternatively, you can also use the seeds of a vanilla pod). Work the mixture with electric beaters .
Until it becomes light and frothy . Once ready, sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl , add a pinch of salt.
Mix the dry ingredients, then add them to the mixture one tablespoon at a time gently with movements from bottom to top, so as not to deflate the mixture. Once the dry ingredients are incorporated, add a pinch of salt, and slowly pour in the melted, cooled butter while still beating with the electric beaters (8-9).
When the butter is combined, the batter will be ready . Grease and flour a rectangular loaf pan measuring 10x4.5 inches, 3 inches high. Bake the pound cake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 40 minutes. Once ready, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly,
then turn it out onto a tray and dust with powdered sugar . Your pound cake is ready to be enjoyed !
The pound cake can be kept for 2-3 days covered with a glass dome. It can also be frozen after baking.
To flavor the pound cake, you can also use citrus zest. For optimal baking, it's always recommended to perform the toothpick test before removing the cake from the oven: pierce the pound cake with a toothpick, once removed, check that it is dry. If it is still moist, continue baking.
