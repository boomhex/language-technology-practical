instructions:
To prepare friggitelli and sausage pasta, start by rinsing the friggitelli under running water , then clean them by removing the stem and slicing them lengthwise .
Remove the seeds inside and set aside the smaller friggitelli while you can cut the larger ones . Take the sausages and remove the casing .
Crumb them or chop them with a knife and move to the stove. Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan, add the sausage and let it brown over low heat until golden, stirring occasionally .
At this point, add the friggitelli and cook for a few minutes while stirring occasionally . In the meantime, you can clean the cherry tomatoes and cut them into 4 parts .
Also add the cherry tomatoes , adjust with salt and pepper , then cook over low heat for 10-15 minutes; at the end, remove the garlic .
At this point, throw the pasta into boiling salted water and make sure to drain it al dente . Meanwhile, you can grate the cheese and choose the basil leaves to clean and tear by hand. Once the sauce is ready, turn off the heat and add the basil .
Add the grated Parmesan and give it a good stir . Complete your friggitelli and sausage pasta with cheese and basil to taste !
It is preferable to consume friggitelli and sausage pasta immediately; however, you can prepare the sauce in advance, even a day before, and store it in the refrigerator.
Add Pecorino for an extra flavor boost, and fresh or powdered chili pepper for a pleasant spicy note.
