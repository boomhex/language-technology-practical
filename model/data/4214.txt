instructions:
The half-moon pasta with salmon and chives is a first course with a very delicate taste, yet at the same time, it forms a very tasty and substantial dish due to the presence of fresh egg dough and the filling of ricotta and smoked salmon. The preparation of the half-moon pasta is somewhat laborious but essentially simple and not excessively long; if you are planning to prepare a fish-based first course, different from the usual, it will be worth making these half-moon pasta with salmon and chives: success is guaranteed!
Prepare the egg pasta according to our recipe (click here). Finely chop the salmon with a knife, place it in a bowl and add the ricotta, 2 tablespoons of chopped chives, and a bit of freshly ground pepper; mix well, taste, and if necessary, adjust with salt. Take the egg pasta and roll it out by hand or with a pasta machine to form a sheet as thin as possible; with the help of a round cutter, cut out discs with a diameter of at least 2 inches.
Place a bit of filling on each disc, then fold it over itself to form a half-moon, pressing the edges slightly to seal them; if the pasta does not adhere well, with the help of a small brush, moisten the edges with some water.
Cook the half-moon pasta in a pot with plenty of salted water for 6-7 minutes; in the meantime, melt the butter in a pan. Drain the half-moons, dress them with the melted butter, and sprinkle with chopped chives. Serve the half-moon pasta with salmon hot.
You can also dress the half-moon pasta with salmon with cream or a light and fluid béchamel sauce, flavored with chives.
