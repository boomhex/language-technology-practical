instructions:
To prepare the fennel and ginger pesto, start by cleaning the fennel. If you notice any rotten or yellowed leaves, remove them; if you see any soil, just remove it with a damp cloth. Then detach the leaves from the stems and collect them in a bowl . Next, move on to the ginger, peel it with a smooth knife , and chop it coarsely; this will make it easier to work in the mortar .
If you don’t have a very large mortar, divide the preparation and do it in two batches. Add the peeled garlic with the core removed, the coarse salt , and the ginger . Start crushing everything using the pestle .
Gradually add the pine nuts, preferably a little at a time , then continue by adding the fennel leaves and then the lemon juice .
Finish with the grated Parmesan and the oil . Stir for another moment until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream. Your fennel and ginger pesto is now ready; you just need to use it .
Store the freshly made fennel and ginger pesto in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 2-3 days, making sure to cover the sauce with a layer of oil. It is possible to freeze the pesto in small jars and then defrost it in the refrigerator or at room temperature.
We used a mortar to make the fennel and ginger pesto, but you can also use a blender: just remember to pulse the blades repeatedly, so they don't heat up and darken the leaves.
Remember that the flavor of this pesto is particularly spicy: reduce the amount of lemon by perhaps substituting with cold water or oil, and eliminate the garlic if it's not to your liking. Finally, you can also reduce the amount of ginger if it's too strong for you.
