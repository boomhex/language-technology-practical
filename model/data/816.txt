Pasta with asparagus and fontina is really one of those springtime dishes that gets folks in Northern Italy super excited. As soon as tender asparagus starts showing up in the markets around Piedmont and Liguria, everyone knows it's time for something special. And look, the twist here is using fontina cheese —a creamy, melt-in-your-mouth favorite from the Alps—blending beautifully with asparagus to make the sauce so so rich and moist. Rigate tortiglioni is the pasta of choice, grabbing onto every bit of that creamy sauce. Seriously good stuff. Compared to the usual asparagus pasta recipe with just olive oil and parmesan, this version feels way more indulgent and comforting, especially with the cheese fondue mixed in.
It’s all about that cozy, golden finish where the cheese gets melty—yum!—the asparagus stays fresh, and the pasta ties it all together in every bite. In Italian kitchens, asparagus sneaks into everything from flan and frittata to risotto and stuffed ravioli. But there’s just something about pasta with asparagus and fontina that makes it a real crowd-pleaser.
Honestly, people love how the fontina cheese pasta feels both light and creamy at the same time—making it perfect for a chilled weekend dinner or, you know, a fancier night in. Some folks even try it as an asparagus and fontina pasta bake for those times when you crave that bubbly, crispy edge on top.
Serving up this kind of creamy asparagus pasta really shows how Italians use local, seasonal veggies to create meals that feel special. Yet, you don’t need anything fancy. Pretty simple. Whether you’re into spring pasta dishes or just looking to mix up your usual easy pasta dinners, this one is worth adding to the list. Playing around with different pasta shapes or even swapping out the cheese can keep things interesting, but to be honest, the combo of fresh asparagus, gooey fontina, and that classic Italian balance of flavors and textures is hard to beat. This dish captures the heart of Italian cooking, celebrating simplicity and quality in every mouthful.

To prepare the pasta with asparagus and fontina, start by cleaning the asparagus. Break off the hard part of the stem , then use a vegetable peeler to peel the asparagus, leaving the top intact . Put all the peeled scraps in a small pot with 250 g (8.8 oz) of water , add the stems and let them simmer over medium heat: this way you'll get a quick broth that you will use to proceed with the recipe.
Cut the asparagus into rounds about 5 mm thick (0.2 inches) , leaving the tips intact ; then divide them in half lengthwise . Put a pot full of salted water on the stove, which will be used to cook the pasta.
In a non-stick pan, brown the clove of garlic in its skin and add the asparagus rounds and tips . Sauté them for a few minutes on high heat .
Now take a ladleful of the asparagus broth and pour it into the pan . Continue this way until they are cooked. Add salt and pepper, and remove the garlic .
As soon as the water starts to boil, add the tortiglioni and cook them for a couple of minutes less than the time indicated on the package. Cut the fontina into pieces and put it in a small pot with the milk .
Turn on the heat to the lowest setting (don't rush to melt the fontina, or it might curdle and not melt anymore). Stir with a whisk until everything is combined . Add a ladle of asparagus broth , stir again, and set aside.
Drain the pasta al dente directly into the pan and toss it to combine with the sauce, adding a ladle of cooking water if necessary . Once ready, turn off the heat and add the fondue .
Mix well , add a pinch of pepper, and the grated Parmesan cheese , and mix again. If it turns out too thick, add a little more cooking water. Serve the pasta with asparagus and fontina immediately !
We recommend consuming the pasta immediately; alternatively, it can be stored in the fridge for 1-2 days in an airtight container.
Thoroughly clean the asparagus with a vegetable peeler; otherwise, the stems might be too tough: this way, both stems and tips will have the same consistency!
If the fondue curdles, we recommend blending it with an immersion mixer.
Instead of milk, you can also use cream for a creamier fondue.
Instead of fontina, you can also use toma, or another cheese with similar texture and aging.
