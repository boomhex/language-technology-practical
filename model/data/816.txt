instructions:
To prepare the sourdough rolls, start with the dough: pour the flour , the refreshed and doubled starter , and half of the water into a large bowl.
Begin kneading with your hands , then add the remaining water and knead again with your hands .
When the water is absorbed, transfer the dough onto a work surface and continue kneading until you have a smooth and elastic dough. At this point, add the salt and continue kneading vigorously for at least 10 minutes until the dough is smooth .
Place it in a bowl previously brushed with oil , cover with plastic wrap , and let it rise for at least 12 hours at a temperature of 70-73°F .
After the necessary time, transfer the dough onto a lightly floured work surface, gently spread it out , and divide it in two . Take the first piece and fold the top edge towards the center .
Then fold the bottom edge towards the center , then do the same with the right edge and the left edge . This way, you've given 4 strengthening folds.
Do the same for the second piece , cover with a cloth , and let it rest for 30 minutes. Give four more folds to each and let it rest covered with a cloth for about 30 minutes. After the necessary time, take one of the pieces and flatten it slightly with your hands .
Cut it into four equal parts and transfer the rolls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them well. Let them rise for an hour , then take a little flour and sprinkle it over the rolls .
Then gently remove the excess flour by brushing it off with your hand . Bake the sourdough rolls in a preheated static oven at 464°F, placing a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven. Bake for about 40 minutes, then take them out and let them cool before serving .
You can store the rolls for 2-3 days in a paper bag. Alternatively, you can freeze them after baking.
If you want to use solid sourdough instead of liquid, add 2 tablespoons of water.
