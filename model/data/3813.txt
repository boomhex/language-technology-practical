instructions:
To prepare the rosemary meatball skewers, place the ground meat in a large bowl. Add the paprika and brown sugar , then clean and finely chop the onion .
Add the chopped onion and the salt . Mix and knead the meat carefully until you obtain a well-blended mixture .
Divide the meat mixture into small portions of about 1/2 oz each and roll them in the palm of your hand to form meatballs . You should get 32 pieces. Now take a rosemary sprig, remove some of the needles, and gently skewer 4 meatballs one after the other . Continue in this way until you have 8 skewers .
Drizzle a pan with extra virgin olive oil , heat it well, and then place the skewers to cook . Brown them for 8-10 minutes, turning them on all sides with the help of a flat spatula or kitchen tongs . Your rosemary meatball skewers are ready. Serve them immediately!
It is preferable to consume the skewers immediately after cooking. It is recommended not to freeze the meatball skewers.
For the skewers, try to find rather sturdy and long rosemary sprigs to prevent them from breaking when skewering the meatballs. Alternatively, you can use wooden skewers.
