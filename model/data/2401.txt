instructions:
To prepare the whole wheat fusilli with green beans, shrimp tails, and a tasty basil sauce, first clean the shrimp: after rinsing them thoroughly, remove the head and legs , remove the shell , gently remove the intestine with a toothpick , and set them aside.
Then focus on the green beans: wash them, trim them and cut them in half ; place a clove of garlic to sauté in the pan with the oil , and when it is well golden,
add the green beans and cook them, gradually adding vegetable broth , one ladle at a time so that they absorb the liquid well, then salt and pepper them, cover with a lid , and let them cook for at least 10-12 minutes.
Cook the pasta , and in the meantime, prepare the basil sauce: gently rinse the basil leaves in a bowl of cold water, then dry them well , place them in a blender with the extra virgin olive oil ,
and after blending the basil leaves well , transfer the mixture to a tall-sided bowl and use an immersion blender to make it smooth , so there are no more basil leaf residues, then add a ladle of pasta cooking water to the sauce to dilute it and make it even creamier.
In the pan, together with the green beans, add the shrimp and sauté for a few minutes, then drain the pasta and transfer it to the pan using a slotted spoon .
Then add the basil sauce to the pan , mix to combine the dressing well with all the ingredients , and your whole wheat fusilli with green beans, shrimp tails, and tasty basil sauce are ready to be served !
You can store the whole wheat fusilli with green beans, shrimp tails, and a tasty basil sauce in the refrigerator for up to one day, sealed tightly in a container.
If you want, instead of the basil sauce, you can flavor your whole wheat fusilli with a fresh basil tomato sauce or add confit cherry tomatoes to give a touch of color to your dish. If you want to make your dish even more sophisticated, you can also use prawns instead of shrimp.
