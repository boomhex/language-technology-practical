Pacchetti regalo is a treat that really gets people talking at a party. Seriously, these little cake gifts are straight from the world of Italian sweets, and they look as fun as they taste. Each one is like a mini present—inside, you’ll find a rich dark chocolate mud cake that’s super moist and loaded with a smooth buttercream filling. It’s all wrapped up in a bright, colorful layer of marzipan , which you can tint any shade you want. And look, that’s what makes these so special: you can get really creative with the colors and decorations, making every piece a little bit different. Italian pastry shops are known for this kind of baking—where the outside looks sweet and playful, and the inside is totally unexpected.
Across Italy, you’ll see marzipan-wrapped desserts, but pacchetti regalo take it up a notch with that chocolate surprise in the middle and all the possibilities for pretty toppings. Pretty much anything goes.
What’s cool is how these sweets turn even a small get-together into something more festive. Birthday tables, afternoon tea, or just hanging out with friends— pacchetti regalo fit right in, adding a pop of color and a tender bite that everyone remembers. People in Italy love putting their own spin on them, using marzipan in shades from pale pink to bright green, and sometimes even adding little details like edible glitter or sugar flowers. And the kids? They love it. Kids and grownups both enjoy unwrapping the marzipan layer to find the rich, chocolatey center, which is super decadent and just the right kind of surprise .
These sweets are a great example of how Italian baking puts just as much focus on how food looks as how it tastes. Whether you’re lining them up on a fancy platter or just passing them around the living room, marzipan-wrapped treats like these make any day feel a little more special. Plus, since the decorations are up to you, every batch of pacchetti regalo can show off your own style—there’s really no wrong way to make them be different. With their colorful colors and delicious centers, these treats are a nod to the playful artistry of Italian desserts. And you know what? They’re really, really fun to make.
To prepare the gift packages, start with the mud cake batter: melt the dark chocolate in a bain-marie, and once it's melted, add the chopped butter . Stir with a spatula and when the butter has melted, pour the mixture into a bowl and add the instant coffee .
Then slit a vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds; add them to the melted chocolate , then also pour in the sugar ,
the eggs and the milk, and mix the batter with a whisk . In a separate bowl, pour the flour, the baking powder , then also add the unsweetened cocoa powder
and mix the batter with the whisk until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture. Pour it into a greased and floured rectangular baking pan measuring 7.5x9.8 inches and bake the mud cake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 60 minutes (320°F for 50 minutes if using a fan oven). Once baked, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly before unmolding and allowing it to cool completely on a wire rack.
While the cake bakes, prepare the buttercream: in a saucepan, pour the water and sugar, stir and bring to a boil; use a kitchen thermometer to ensure the sugar syrup does not exceed 250°F . Meanwhile, in a stand mixer, beat the egg yolks (you can also use an electric mixer), add the syrup when it reaches the correct temperature and continue to beat until the mixture is cool .
Meanwhile, beat the softened butter with the seeds from a vanilla bean ; when the cream is cool, add one teaspoon of butter at a time, waiting for the previous to be incorporated before adding more . When the buttercream is ready, place it in a bowl and, if the mud cake is still too warm to be filled, cover it with cling film touching the surface and refrigerate until ready to use.
When the mud cake is completely cool, cut it into 2 layers and fill the base with the buttercream placed in a pastry bag . Close with the other base ,
trim the edges to even out the cake and divide it into 12 equal cubes, each 2 inches per side . Cover each cube with the leftover buttercream, spread with a spatula . Now prepare the decorations (in these photo sequences we show an example of decoration, but you can get creative with colors and bows): roll out a block of marzipan with a rolling pin ;
then cut out a cross with equal arms, 6 inches long and 2 inches wide : wrap each package with one arm while the other can be cut into two squares of 2 inches per side to close the package (26-27).
Then color another block of marzipan with a few drops of food coloring to make the ribbons and colored bow: in this case, we used red coloring and made two strips about 0.4 inches thick to place on the packages like a ribbon .
Then make a small bow with colored marzipan and place it on the package at the ribbon (32-33). Create many gift packages to unwrap bite after bite!
The gift packages can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days covered with plastic wrap. The mud cake without filling can be kept for 2-3 days under a glass dome. The buttercream can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days covered with cling film touching the surface.
An extra idea? Mix the scraps of different colors to create more packages and make them truly surprising!
