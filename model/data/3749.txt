The golden, shiny shells and perfect broth make for eye-catching platters that always look great on the table. Most people notice right away how tender these mussels turn out – juicy, soft , and stacked high with flavor. When there’s laughter around the table and people are grabbing slices of bread to dip, you know the mussels recipe is doing its job.

Remove the beard (byssus) protruding from each mussel shell, discard the broken ones , and clean the shells of the remaining mussels by scrubbing them (or scrubbing them with a new steel wool pad) , then rinse them under running water and drain.
Wash, remove the strings, and slice the celery into 1/4 inch thick pieces; wash the lime (or a lemon), dry it, and use a vegetable peeler to remove the zest without getting the white part (which can be bitter); cut the removed zest into thin strips .
Squeeze the lime and set the juice aside. Peel and cut the onion in half, then slice the two halves into pieces about 1/10 inch thick . In a large pot, melt the butter and then add the celery, lime zest , and onion ;
let the vegetables wilt, then add lime juice and the beer .
Cook the ingredients for a few minutes, then add the ground pepper and the mussels . Mix the ingredients well and cook everything on high heat until the shellfish are fully opened, then turn off the heat and serve immediately, accompanied by stick-cut fries.
