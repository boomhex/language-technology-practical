First, start with the preparation of the rack : any excess fat present and the membrane covering the rib bones should be removed. To perform the latter operation, proceed as follows: lift a corner of the membrane using a pointed object and grasp it with the help of a paper towel : this will give you a better grip. Gently pull, and you will see it come off easily. Now cover the surface of all the ribs with mustard liberally, and if you're preparing more than one rack, you can stack them without any issue. Now let the meat rest while you prepare the rub (spice mix to coat the meat).
Combine all the spices in a bowl and mix them well to blend them as evenly as possible (4-5). Now, distribute the rub over the ribs , the mustard applied earlier will help with adhesion.
Don't hold back during this operation (7-8-9): the spices will form a crunchy crust full of flavor that will enhance this preparation. Now let them rest in the fridge, covered with aluminum foil, while you prepare the bbq.
Soak wood chips in water or beer for at least an hour. Light the charcoal or briquettes and place them lit inside the bbq on the sides of the drip pan, which you will have previously inserted full of water (11-12) and should be kept that way.
Bring the bbq to an operating temperature of 230°F, then insert the damp chips by placing them directly on the coals. When they start to smoke, place the ribs so they are above the drip pan and close the lid. The smoke from the chips lasts on average about twenty minutes, after which you will need to refill to keep the smoking constant and continuous for a couple of hours. At this point, your job is to maintain a constant temperature by adjusting the air vents. Every hour, spray apple cider vinegar on the meat to soften the smoke effect; in the absence of a spray bottle, you can also brush it on, but this way, you risk compromising the delicate spice crust. During this hourly check, also verify the presence of water in the drip pan and add fuel if necessary.
After four and a half hours of cooking at 230°F, remove the ribs from the bbq and generously brush them with Jack Daniel's bbq sauce over the entire surface of the ribs , then return them to the bbq after removing the liquid from the drip pan. This step will allow the sauce to dry, giving your ribs a unique color and flavor. The finishing operation lasts about half an hour. At the end of this step, you can proceed to cut the meat and plate it with Jack Daniel's sauce as an accompaniment.
