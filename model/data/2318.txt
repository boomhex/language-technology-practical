instructions:
To prepare the cake with chestnut flour, start by placing the room temperature eggs in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with beaters , then add the sugar , a pinch of salt, turn on the mixer, and mix the ingredients well. Next, take the vanilla bean, split it open to retrieve the seeds
and add them to the mixture . Then, pour in the oil in a thin stream and the milk at room temperature .
In a bowl, sift the chestnut flour and all-purpose flour , add the baking powder , then gradually add the dry ingredients to the mixture, using a spoon to help .
Mix until you obtain a smooth and fluid batter . Grease and flour a fairly deep bundt pan with a 9-inch diameter and pour the batter in . Distribute it evenly with the help of a spatula, and avoid banging the pan to level the batter to not stop the rising process. Bake the cake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for about 50 minutes (or if using a convection oven at 300°F for 40 minutes). Once the baking time has elapsed, do the toothpick test to check if it's well-cooked and leave it in the turned-off oven for 5 minutes before removing it.
Once removed from the oven , invert it onto a wire rack to cool completely, after which your cake with chestnut flour is ready to be enjoyed!
Store the cake with chestnut flour under a glass dome for about 2-3 days.
The cake can be frozen once baked.
To make your cake with chestnut flour even more delicious, you can serve it with melted dark chocolate or whipped cream!
