instructions:
Wash the potatoes well, then put them in a pot and add water to cover them . Turn on the heat and let them cook for about 30 minutes. Check the cooking with the tines of a fork; they should be soft but not overcooked. Once cooked, drain them and let them cool slightly. At this point, peel the onion , cut it in half first
and then into thin slices . Move on to the bacon, cut it into slices first and then into cubes .
Peel the now warm potatoes , cut them in half and then into cubes . There’s no need to be very precise.
In a pot, pour the oil and about half of the butter . Let it melt, then add the onions and cook for a few minutes. Then add the bacon
and brown everything for about ten minutes. Add the potatoes to the pot and mix .
Crush some of the potatoes using a ladle , season with pepper and salt. Then add the remaining butter .
Continue cooking for another 10-13 minutes, occasionally adding a little broth to prevent the potatoes from burning . Once cooking is complete, make sure a nice crust has formed. At this point, the potatoes are ready to be served!
We recommend consuming the potatoes in tecia immediately. Alternatively, you can store them in the fridge for one day and reheat them in the oven before serving.
For the best results, we recommend using potatoes of the same size. This way, during boiling, you will achieve even cooking.
