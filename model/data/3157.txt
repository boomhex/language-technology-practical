instructions:
To prepare diplomatic cream without gelatin, start by preparing the pastry cream: heat the milk in a saucepan with half a vanilla bean and its seeds . In a bowl, whisk the egg yolk and sugar , then add the flour. Use tongs to remove the bean .
pour the heated milk into the mixture slowly , blending with the whisk. Return the mixture to the heat and stir continuously until the cream thickens . Transfer the pastry cream into a bowl and let it cool, covering it with a sheet of plastic wrap in contact .
Prepare the Chantilly cream: pour the well-chilled cream into the bowl of a stand mixer equipped with a whisk , or use an electric mixer, and whip it; when the cream has reached a thick consistency, add the sifted powdered sugar , and fold it into the cream, stirring with a spatula .
When the pastry cream is completely cold, add the Chantilly cream and blend the two creams with a whisk until a fluffy, smooth, and homogeneous mixture is obtained . Your diplomatic cream is ready!
Store the diplomatic cream in an airtight container in the refrigerator for about 3 days. You can freeze the cream and thaw it in the refrigerator when needed.
You can flavor the diplomatic cream with maraschino, marsala, rum, or another liqueur of your choice. To make the cream more compact, in case you want to serve it as a spoon dessert, simply add a sheet of gelatin softened in cold water to the hot pastry cream.
