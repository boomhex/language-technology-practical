instructions:
To prepare the purceddhruzzi, start by making the dough. In a bowl, pour the flour , add a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper. Also add the orange zest
and the limoncello . Start mixing the ingredients, then also add the oil .
Work the mixture in the bowl, and when you get a homogeneous consistency , transfer it to a surface and continue kneading until it's smooth . It may take a long time, be patient while working it. Then wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for an hour at room temperature.
After the resting time, take a portion of dough and, by rolling the dough between your fingers and the surface , form a loaf about 3/8 inch thick .
Then cut into 3/8 inch pieces and shape the purceddhruzzi by passing them over a gnocchi board, lightly flouring it . Continue this way and arrange them on a tray lined with a towel .
Meanwhile, heat plenty of oil in a pan, it should reach 338°F. When it reaches this temperature, immerse a few pieces at a time and cook for a few minutes until they are well golden. Then drain them and transfer to another tray, with paper towels, to remove excess oil .
When you have finished frying, pour the honey into a large pan . Heat it without letting it boil, then turn off the heat and add the purceddhruzzi , gently stir until they are well covered .
Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with colored sprinkles and serve them .
Store the purcidduzzi for 3-4 days under a glass dome.

Instead of limoncello, you can use the same amount of dry white wine.
