Sticky potatoes, or le patate 'mpacchiuse , are a beloved classic from Cosenza in Calabria, Southern Italy. Really, folks here take pride in how these potatoes stick together, creating a crispy outside and a tender inside. I mean, the secret? It lies in using special yellow-fleshed potatoes, especially the 'Agria' variety from the Sila plateau. These potatoes hold their shape and don’t soak up too much oil, making slices that are golden and perfectly stuck together.
So, listen, this dish is commonly served with both meat and fish, making it a staple at family tables and local trattorias around Cosenza. Some variations include pancetta, mushrooms, or onions for added flavor. And the basic idea? It’s simple ingredients that really really show off the potato’s taste. In Cosentino cooking, potatoes are kinda vital because the plateau is ideal for growing them. You'll find other potato dishes like tiella di pasta e patate showing up a lot too.
When it comes to easy potato recipes, sticky potatoes stand out for their simplicity. You just let them cook slowly until the slices stick together, turning a handful of ingredients into something moist and comforting. And everyone loves to dig into it. It’s not trying to be fancy—just really good flavors coming together. It’s a bit like Korean braised potatoes or Gamja Jorim , offering that sweet and savory bite, but with a southern Italian twist.
The pride in Calabrian cooking really shines with every bite, from the crispy edges to the tender inside, all sticking together and soaking up a bit of salt and olive oil. And look, whether you enjoy it alongside roasted meats or just on its own, these potatoes are a staple that showcase the flavors of Calabria, plain and simple. They’re not just a side dish—they're a celebration of the region’s rich agricultural heritage, for sure.

To prepare sticky potatoes, first wash them under water, then peel them . Next, cut the potatoes into fairly thin round slices, about 1/8 inch . You can slice them with a knife or a mandolin.
At this point, take a high non-stick pan that's not too wide (in this case, the more the potatoes are piled and overlapped, the better!) and pour in plenty of oil . The amount of oil should be enough to fully cover the bottom of the pan, reaching about 1/2 inch in height. An important consideration is that the potatoes should not be completely immersed in the oil, as with fried ones. Heat the oil in the pan, then add all the potatoes and season with salt . Cook over high heat.
After a few minutes, shake the pan, then with the help of a spoon, gently turn the potatoes over . To avoid breaking the potatoes too much, it's important not to stir too often, but rather every few minutes. Cook for about 25 minutes until the potatoes are cooked . Then drain them from excess oil and serve .
We recommend consuming sticky potatoes immediately; alternatively, you can store them in the fridge for 1-2 days and reheat them before serving.
If you can't find Sila potatoes, you can use yellow-fleshed potatoes. Sticky potatoes can be enriched with mushrooms, bacon, or Tropea onions.
