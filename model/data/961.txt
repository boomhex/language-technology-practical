To prepare the festive velouté, start by tying the bay leaf, rosemary, and cinnamon with kitchen twine: this will be our aromatic bundle. Then peel and slice the ginger root, clean and finely chop the shallots, and after cleaning the turnips, potatoes, and pumpkin, cut them into chunks. In a thick-bottomed pot, heat some extra virgin olive oil, sauté the shallots and ginger, add the aromatic bundle, and then the vegetables. Let them toast for a few minutes, stirring often, then deglaze with the wine and let it evaporate completely. Cover with water, adjust the salt, and cook for 30 minutes. At the end of cooking, remove the aromatic bundle and use an immersion blender to achieve a smooth cream. In the meantime, you can prepare the crumble: in a bowl, quickly work the cold butter with the spelt flour, cooked and crumbled chestnuts, chopped hazelnuts, a pinch of salt, and a sprig of chopped rosemary. Form coarse crumbs and spread them on a baking sheet, bake in a preheated oven at 350°F for about 15 minutes. When everything is ready, pour the velouté into the dishes, garnish each with a spoonful of sour cream, the crumble, some currants, and some sprigs of rosemary. Your festive velouté is ready, enjoy!
You can store your festive velouté for a couple of days at most by keeping it in the refrigerator!
If you prefer, you can also make this recipe vegan! Just a few changes are needed: mix the crumble with vegetable butter and replace the sour cream with a drizzle of tahini or hazelnut paste.
