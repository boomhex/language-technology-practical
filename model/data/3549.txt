instructions:
Clean the pumpkin by removing the skin and seeds; cut it into cubes and weigh 600 grams (about 1 lb 5 oz); transfer it to the steamer basket and cook in a pressure cooker for about 5-7 minutes from when you hear the pressure whistle; turn off and leave the pot covered until it is warm, then open it; take out the pumpkin flesh, lightly strain it in a colander, and then put it in the mixer bowl ;
add the eggs and flour sifted with powdered sugar and start mixing; then gradually add the cream and honey, finally the cinnamon and nutmeg; you should obtain a fairly liquid mixture but without lumps. Butter and flour a 9-inch round pan and pour the mixture in . Place in a preheated oven at 350°F to bake for about 30-40 minutes; the dessert will be ready when you see it naturally detach from the sides of the pan; remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes, then turn it upside down onto a serving plate and let it cool completely; once cool, cut it into diamonds with a dampened knife and optionally sprinkle with powdered sugar.
