To prepare the blancmange, soak the gelatin sheets in a bowl with cold water for at least 10 minutes . Place the peeled almonds together with the sugar in a food processor equipped with blades
and chop them . Transfer the chopped almonds to a bowl, pour in the milk , and mix well with a spatula
to obtain a smooth and lump-free mixture ; cover with plastic wrap and let it infuse for an entire night . After the necessary time has passed, strain the mixture through a cloth placed inside a bowl ,
then squeeze the cloth well to extract all the liquid and collect it in the bowl (10-11). Place the chopped and softened almonds contained in the cloth on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper ,
spreading them evenly with the help of a spatula : you can use them for the final decoration. Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 30 minutes (or at 320°F for 20 minutes if using a fan oven), until they become golden and crispy ; remove from the oven, let them cool completely, and set aside. Pour the liquid you previously obtained into a pot, heating it over low heat for 3-4 minutes (it should not come to a boil) .
Squeeze the gelatin sheets well and add them to the mixture , stirring well until completely dissolved, then turn off the heat and let it cool. Whip the cream with a whisk and, when the mixture is completely cold, add it to the whipped cream little by little ;
gently mix everything, being careful not to deflate it (19-20). Pour the mixture into 5 molds of 3.5 oz each and let it cool in the refrigerator for 6 hours.
Subsequently, unmold the dessert by dipping the molds in hot water for a few seconds . Serve on a serving plate and finally decorate the blancmange by distributing the crunchy almonds you have prepared as desired .
You can store the blancmange in the refrigerator for a maximum of 2-3 days (preferably in the molds). Freezing is not recommended.
For decoration, let your imagination run wild! You can accompany your blancmange with melted chocolate or a tasty raspberry jam, or even with candied fruit, chopped pistachios, and orange zest.
It is said that blancmange was present at the grand banquet held by Matilda of Canossa on the occasion of the reconciliation between Pope Gregory VII and the young emperor Henry IV of Franconia, her cousin. Historical sources describe a magnificent dinner, which concluded with a refined dish, the blancmange.
