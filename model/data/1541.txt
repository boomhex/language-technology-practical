instructions:
To prepare the fennel tatin, start by cleaning the fennel. After removing the base and the fronds , cut them in half: set one half aside and further cut the remaining halves again .
In a pan, add the butter and let it melt before adding the fennel and cooking them for 7-8 minutes over medium-high heat, covered with a lid .
Flip the pieces and continue cooking for another 15 minutes over slightly lower heat . In the meantime, butter a 9-inch mold well .
Arrange the fennel inside by placing the quarters and the half in the center . Sprinkle with grated cheese (11 and 12),
season with salt and pepper , then place a round sheet of puff pastry inside, already unrolled . Fold the puff pastry inwards to create a border .
Pierce the surface with a fork . Bake the fennel tarte tatin in a static oven preheated to 392°F, for about 20 minutes . Let it cool for 10 minutes before flipping and serving it .
The fennel tatin can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
As an alternative to puff pastry, you can use shortcrust pastry as the base for your fennel tatin: it will be much crunchier and cookie-like. For an extra touch of flavor and a more stringy effect, add or replace the Parmesan with Emmental cheese. In this case, remember to unmold the tatin after 5 minutes to prevent the cheese from sticking.
