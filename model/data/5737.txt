Note To have the butter at room temperature, it should be taken out several hours in advance if in winter; at least an hour ahead in summer.

instructions:
To prepare the cookies, make sure the butter is soft. Then pour into a bowl the brown sugar and the granulated sugar . Add a pinch of salt and the butter .
Work with an electric mixer until the ingredients are combined , add the egg and work again with the electric mixer .
Once it is well absorbed, add the flour and the baking soda . Work with the electric mixer until you have a smooth mixture.
Add the chocolate chips and mix with a spatula . Now using a 2-inch diameter scoop take a portion of dough (about 1.4-1.6 oz) .
Then, place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, well spaced apart , as they will tend to spread a lot during baking. Bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for 13-15 minutes until they are golden brown. Remove from the oven , let cool and serve your cookies !
Store the cookies in a tin box for up to 2 weeks.
Freezing the dough is not recommended.
If you prefer a version even closer to the American one, use muscovado sugar instead of brown sugar and granulated sugar. You might need to slightly revise the doses of the other ingredients, particularly the flour, since the moisture content of this type of sugar is different from the others.
It's possible to add ground cinnamon, vanilla, or lemon zest to flavor the dough. Instead of chocolate chips, you can use roughly chopped nuts, such as pecans. Alternatively, you can also use dehydrated blueberries.
