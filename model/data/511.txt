instructions:
To prepare the risotto with burrata, capers, and cherry tomatoes, start with the latter. Wash them well and cut them in half lengthwise . Arrange them in a baking tray with the cut side facing up . Season with oil .
Add salt and sugar . Scent with oregano and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 30-40 minutes.
Meanwhile, desalt the capers by rinsing them under water, then place them on a sheet of kitchen paper and dry them well by pressing with the paper to remove all the water . Fry the capers in hot oil at 320°F, using a slotted spoon to immerse them .
As soon as they open and rise to the surface, drain them ; transfer them to a tray with absorbent paper . Pour the burrata into a bowl and blend it with an immersion blender .
You don't need to blend it for long, just until it becomes creamy . Place a pot full of water on the heat and bring it to a boil; it will be used to cook the rice. Pour the rice into another pot and toast it over medium heat .
Add a pinch of salt right away and to know the rice is perfectly toasted, you can touch it with your hands (be careful not to burn yourself), it should be scorching. At this point, deglaze with white wine . Cook the rice by adding 1-2 ladles of hot water as needed .
Meanwhile, the cherry tomatoes will be ready, remove them from the oven and transfer most to a tall and narrow container. Set aside the prettiest ones for decorating the dish. Add a little hot water and a drizzle of oil .
Blend everything until you obtain a cream , then strain it to make the roasted tomato coulis. As soon as the rice is al dente, remove it from the heat and add the burrata .
Adjust the salt, also add the grated zest of a lemon and a drizzle of oil . Mix well with a wooden spoon .
You should get a well-creamed and creamy risotto . Plate the rice; if you prefer, you can use a pastry ring. Decorate with the cherry tomato coulis, the fried capers, and some cherry tomatoes . Add a bit of grated lemon zest, a drizzle of oil, and serve !
We recommend consuming the risotto as soon as it's ready. The coulis can be prepared in advance and stored in the fridge.
Blending the burrata prevents strings during creaming. This way, you'll get a really creamy risotto. To cook the rice, you can also use vegetable broth, but you will lose the pristine white color.
