instructions:
To cut the sponge cake with a knife, get a long, thin-bladed knife like the one usually used for bread, and a table knife. With the help of the smaller knife, make a mark along the entire circumference of the sponge cake, exactly halfway through its thickness, to mark the area where to make the cut : this will help you achieve a more precise cut. Now insert the blade of the longer knife following the guideline and try not to tilt the blade , then cut the sponge cake completely to obtain two discs of equal size .
To cut the sponge cake with thread, get a nylon or sewing thread that is strong enough, and a table knife; then proceed to draw the guideline as indicated above . Now pass the thread through the mark and, keeping it parallel to the sponge cake, pull until you complete the cut . Using this technique, you can make a more precise cut and get a sponge cake perfectly divided into two equal parts .
You can store the sponge cake, wrapped in plastic wrap, in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. If you want to store the sponge cake after cutting it, proceed the same way, but be careful to cover the two halves with plastic wrap. If you need to store the sponge cake for a few hours, you can keep it under a glass dome in a cool and dry place.
For the best results, we recommend preparing the sponge cake a day before cutting and filling it. If you have a taller sponge cake, you can make two or more cuts to obtain different layers.
