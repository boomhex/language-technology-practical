instructions:
To prepare the cabbage and sausage risotto, first make the broth that you will use to cook the rice: remove the outer leaves of the cabbage and place them in a pot full of water along with half an onion , then bring to a boil over medium heat.
Cut the rest of the cabbage into strips , then dice the other half of the onion finely . Add the onion to a saucepan where you have heated some oil .
When the onion is golden, add the cabbage strips and stew over medium-high heat for a few minutes . Once softened, remove the cabbage from the saucepan and set it aside.
Now remove the casing from the sausage and crumble it with your hands . Place the sausage in the same saucepan where you stewed the cabbage and brown it over high heat for a few minutes, stirring frequently .
Remove the browned sausage from the pan and set it aside, then deglaze the bottom with a ladle of hot broth and pour the obtained liquid into the pot with the broth to further flavor it .
At this point, heat a little oil in the same saucepan and toast the rice for a couple of minutes , then deglaze with a ladle of broth and add the stewed cabbage, keeping some aside for decoration .
Continue cooking the rice by adding one ladle of broth at a time, ensuring the previous is always absorbed . Season with salt and pepper . At the end of cooking, add the sausage, keeping some aside for decoration .
Turn off the heat and cream with butter and grated Parmigiano Reggiano PDO , then mix well to combine .
Plate and garnish with the cabbage and sausage set aside . Serve your cabbage and sausage risotto immediately !
Cabbage and sausage risotto can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container.
For a stronger flavor, you can cream the cabbage and sausage risotto with a cheese like casera or taleggio instead of Parmigiano Reggiano PDO!
