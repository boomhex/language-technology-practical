Neapolitans love a twist, for real, and this one is a real treat, especially with smoky provola cheese and sweet datterini tomatoes thrown in.
Just when you think it is all about gooey cheese, you stumble upon crunchy bits of Neapolitan taralli sprinkled on top.

This pizza is all about sharing good times, as pizza should be!
With the pesto and ricotta pizza concept, you get layers of moist, herby filling wrapped in a golden crust that's really hard to resist. The real trick, and I mean it, lies in the stuffed rim, making every bite a little adventure. Some even start from the edge—gotta get to that creamy center first. On top, the cheese bubbles alongside those crispy taralli bits, giving each mouthful a mix of smooth and crunchy textures.
This kind of stuffed crust pizza recipe is gaining fans outside Italy too. It's a fantastic way to make your easy homemade pizza feel a bit over-the-top, which is great. Whether it's a weekend treat or you're trying out new toppings, the Campania-style cheese-stuffed crust brings people together, no question. Each time you make it, you can experiment with different local cheeses or switch up the pesto for a fresh twist, but that tangy, creamy edge is always, and I mean always, a winner.
