instructions:
To prepare the shrimps in almond crust, first finely chop the coriander . In a bowl, place the Greek yogurt, add the lime zest and lime juice .
Add the coriander , season with salt and pepper , then mix to combine the ingredients . Keep in the fridge until ready to use.
Now take care of cleaning the shrimps. Remove the head and the shell . With a knife, cut along the back and remove the intestine . Set aside.
In a bowl, place the egg whites, add a pinch of salt and whip until stiff peaks form .
Coat the shrimps first in the almond flour , then in the egg whites , and finally in the almond flakes , pressing slightly to make them adhere to the shrimps.
Heat the oil to a temperature of 340°F and fry the shrimps , a few at a time to avoid significantly lowering the oil temperature. Drain them and place them on absorbent paper to remove excess oil . Your shrimps in almond crust are ready to be served with the yogurt sauce .
The shrimps in almond crust should be consumed as soon as they are ready, but they can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out, for up to 1 day.
The coating must be thin and uniform to achieve even cooking and perfect crunchiness. Fry the shrimps a few at a time to avoid lowering the oil temperature. The cooking will be quick, so do not fry them for too long to prevent them from becoming tough.
