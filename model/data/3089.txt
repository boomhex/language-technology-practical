Blinis al Nesquik are a fun twist on the classic Russian pancake, turning them into a sweet delight that everyone can enjoy. Traditionally paired with savory toppings like smoked salmon or caviar, this version switches things up by adding Nesquik. And here's the thing: It gives the pancakes a rich cocoa flavor that’s seriously hard to resist. The result? A soft and slightly moist treat—kinda like the best parts of a brownie and a pancake combined.
Now, the real magic happens when you add a thick layer of crema al cioccolato bianco . It's creamy and delightfully sweet, perfectly complementing the cocoa. Topped with fresh berries and a touch of mint, it enhances the flavor and adds a refreshing burst of color and tartness. This keeps the dish from being too heavy. And look, this presentation is visually striking. It's a great choice for a dessert buffet or a fancy coffee pairing after dinner.
So here's the deal: Transforming blinis from their traditional savory style to this innovative sweet version is a clever move. Pretty simple, really. You can prepare a batch that guests will keep reaching for until the plate is empty. The chocolatey taste from the Nesquik makes these blinis al Nesquik super super different.
When you take a bite that includes both the tender pancake and the smooth white chocolate filling, it's an experience that’s really hard to forget. This ricetta blinis dolci is great because it doesn’t require much effort, yet it looks impressive with those golden pancakes, colorful berries, and mint sprigs. For those familiar with blinis, this sweet version is a pleasant surprise.
The combination of blinis con crema and fruit is so satisfying that it just works. No question. Whether you call them blinis al cioccolato or your new go-to party food, they're a fantastic way to shake up dessert and bring a bit of Russian flair to your table. Each bite offers something unique—sweet, creamy, and fruity, creating a perfect balance that delights the senses.
To prepare the Nesquik blinis with white chocolate cream, start with the cream: pour the cold milk into a small saucepan , then add Nestlé condensed milk and mix everything with a whisk .
Add the sifted flour and continue mixing with the whisk to dissolve the flour and avoid lumps . Now move the saucepan to the stove and bring the milk to a simmer, continuing to stir the mixture with the whisk
Meanwhile, soak the gelatin in cold water for about 10 minutes ; after the necessary time, squeeze the gelatin well and add it to the mixture , stirring to dissolve it completely. At this point, add the coarsely chopped white chocolate and
continue working with the whisk until the chocolate is completely melted and the cream has reached a creamy and fairly firm consistency. Transfer the prepared white chocolate cream to a bowl , let it cool at room temperature, then store it in the refrigerator for at least two hours with a sheet of cling film touching the surface .
Now move on to the preparation of the blinis batter: separate the egg yolks from the whites and keep them aside, and work them in a bowl with an electric mixer or a hand whisk , pouring the cold milk in a thin stream . Continue beating until a homogeneous and frothy mixture is obtained .
Add the dry ingredients to the yolk and milk mixture, sifting them: first the flour , then the baking powder and salt , and finally the Nesquik .
Continue working the mixture with the whisk, starting at the lowest speed , until all the ingredients are well combined . Cover the bowl with cling film and place the yolk and Nesquik mixture in the refrigerator to rest for at least 1 hour .
Whip the egg whites with a mixer or stand mixer and beat them until stiff peaks form (22-23). Add the whipped egg whites to the yolk and Nesquik mixture and
gently fold them in with a spatula, mixing from bottom to top to avoid deflating them . In the end, you will obtain a homogeneous and fairly fluid and frothy mixture. Melt the butter in a preheated non-stick pan (or crepe pan) , so the blinis do not stick, then take a spoonful of batter at a time (about 0.5-0.7 oz) and pour it onto the pan .
Form small circles with the batter by letting it drip from the tip of the spoon and keeping it always in the center, so as to obtain perfect circles . Let them cook for about 1 minute, then flip your blinis to the other side and cook for another 1 minute . Once ready, place the blinis on a flat plate to cool slightly, and continue in this way until all the batter is used .
Move on to decorating the blinis: transfer the white chocolate cream into a piping bag and squeeze a tuft of cream onto each blinis, following the edge shape . Complete the decoration by placing your preferred berries in the center (32-33) and finishing with a fresh mint leaf. We placed a blueberry, a raspberry, a currant, and a mint leaf on each blinis, but you can decorate your Nesquik blinis with white chocolate cream as you like!
The decorated Nesquik blinis with white chocolate cream can be stored in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for a maximum of two days, to avoid spoiling the fruit and cream. The white chocolate cream can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days but, since it contains gelatin, when you want to use it, you'll need to soften it with a couple of tablespoons of milk. You can store the blinis batter, before adding the eggs, covered with cling film for one day in the refrigerator; the next day, add the stiffly beaten egg whites and cook the blinis. Freezing the blinis and cream is not recommended.
Instead of berries, you can use any type of fruit to decorate the Nesquik blinis with white chocolate cream: strawberries, kiwi, orange, grapes, pears… If you prefer, instead of white chocolate cream, you can also use simple whipped cream or buttercream.
