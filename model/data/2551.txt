To make the snowflake cake, start with preparing the three white chocolate bases. Finely chop the white chocolate with a knife , then melt it in a bain-marie with warm milk and butter cut into pieces , being careful that the water underneath does not touch the container.
Stir with a spatula , then add the sugar and let it dissolve completely; turn off the heat and let it cool. Place the butter, chocolate, and milk mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk and start whipping.
Add the eggs at room temperature one at a time, waiting for the previous one to be well incorporated before adding the next one . Sift the flour and baking powder , then cut the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with a small knife .
Once the mixture is whipped, transfer it to a bowl and add the dry ingredients along with the vanilla bean seeds a little at a time, folding with a spatula from bottom to top to mix all the ingredients well . At this point, place 2 steel rings lined with strips of parchment paper, one with a diameter of 6.3 inches and the other 4 inches, on a buttered baking sheet lined with a sheet of parchment paper. Pour the batter into the two rings until they are ⅔ full, and pour the remaining batter into a buttered springform pan lined with parchment paper measuring 8.7 inches , leveling the surface well . Bake the rings first: in a preheated static oven at 338°F for 30 minutes for the smaller cake (or at 302°F for 20 minutes if using a convection oven) and for 45 minutes for the medium one (35 minutes if using a convection oven). Once baked, remove from the oven and cook the larger cake at the same temperature for 60 minutes (50 if using a convection oven). If the surface of the cakes darkens too much during baking, cover with aluminum foil because the batter, containing a lot of sugar, tends to darken.
When the cake is ready , let it cool on a wire rack along with the smaller ones. Meanwhile, prepare the Ganache cream : chop the dark chocolate , then place a saucepan with cream on the heat to warm it .
When the cream is about to boil, pour it over the chopped chocolate , stirring with a whisk to melt it completely . Transfer the chocolate and cream mixture to a bowl containing ice and
whip it for 10-15 minutes with an electric mixer with whisks . When the larger cake has completely cooled, cut it in half and use a spatula to spread a portion of the ganache you prepared on the base layer .
Reassemble the cake by placing the other disc on the filling , then cover the entire surface with some of the ganache , spreading it evenly on all sides . Let the cake set in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, then proceed the same way with the other two smaller ones.
Take the already rolled sugar paste, unroll it and How to cover a cake with fondant the larger cake with the help of a rolling pin . Smooth the surface and sides with a smoother to adhere the sugar paste well and avoid folds ,
then trim the edges with a smooth-bladed knife , removing the excess part that you will save for the final decorations. Once ready , cover the other 2 smaller cakes in the same way. Knead the leftover sugar paste you saved and roll out the paste on a work surface dusted with powdered sugar; with specific cutters of 3 different sizes, cut out snowflakes .
Take the pearl-colored edible glitter pen and decorate the snowflakes you obtained . Take the blue glitter sugars, distribute them on the snowflakes , and let them dry for one night. Now you can assemble the cake: insert 4 plastic rods (the same height as the base) in the center of the larger cake and stack a cardboard circle with a diameter less than 6.3 inches on top.
Place the medium cake and then the smaller one , stacking them one on top of the other .
decorate the base of each tier with the blue satin ribbon . Take the edible glue, brush the back of the snowflakes. Gently attach them to the cake, distributing them on each tier , pressing with your fingers for 1 minute so they adhere well: your beautiful snowflake cake is ready to be served and enjoyed !
Store the snowflake cake for up to 4 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container. You can freeze it after baking without the sugar paste covering and decorations.
This cake is a true spectacle for the eyes and the palate! If you want a more distinctive and flavorful taste, instead of the dark chocolate ganache you can fill your snowflake cake with a delicious pistachio cream; add some chopped nuts, and the result will be spectacular!
