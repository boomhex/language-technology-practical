instructions:
To make the whole wheat crepes with mascarpone and mushrooms, pour the flour into a bowl, add the salt , pepper, and pour in the milk while whisking . Also incorporate the egg
and the melted butter at room temperature , continue mixing with the whisk to obtain a smooth and lump-free batter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, clean the mushrooms: remove the earthy base and impurities with a damp cloth. Slice the mushrooms .
In a pan, add the garlic and oil , heat and add the mushrooms . Cook for about 5-6 minutes, seasoning with salt and pepper. At the end of cooking, add the parsley .
Remove the garlic and set aside . Prepare the mascarpone sauce. In a small saucepan, pour the milk and mascarpone , heat over low heat. Season with salt, pepper, and a nice grating of nutmeg .
Once you have a smooth sauce , turn off the heat and set aside. Now, heat a crepe pan or a non-stick pan about 8 inches in diameter, lightly grease the bottom with some butter and pour a ladle of batter .
Tilt the pan to allow the mixture to spread evenly across the bottom and cook for 3 minutes on one side and a couple of minutes on the other . Finish cooking all the crepes and stack them on a plate .
Now fill each crepe with two tablespoons of sauce and the mushrooms . Fold the crepe
And then fold it again in half, creating a fan shape . Take an oven dish, distribute a layer of mascarpone sauce on the bottom , and place the crepes on top .
Pour the remaining sauce on top and sprinkle with grated cheese . Bake in a static oven at 392°F for 10 minutes, then switch to grill for 2-3 minutes to brown the surface well. The whole wheat crepes with mascarpone and mushrooms are ready, take them out of the oven and serve them hot .
The whole wheat crepes with mascarpone and mushrooms can be stored in the fridge for one day. We do not recommend freezing.
To ensure your crepes batter is smooth and lump-free, we recommend using room temperature ingredients and adding the liquids gradually while stirring thoroughly with a whisk.
