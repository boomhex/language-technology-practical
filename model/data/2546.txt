To prepare the cocoa cake with chocolate ganache, add the room temperature softened butter cut into pieces along with the sugar in a stand mixer with whisks. Slice the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with a knife .
Start the whisks until you get a light and fluffy cream. Add the vanilla bean seeds and the whole eggs plus 1 room temperature yolk one at a time, waiting for the previous one to be absorbed before adding the next, continuing to whip . In a separate bowl, sift the flour, baking powder , and
the unsweetened cocoa . Add the flour one tablespoon at a time into the dough, continuing with the stand mixer , ensuring it is incorporated into the mixture .
Also gradually add the cocoa and finally pour in the room temperature milk ; blend all the ingredients well until you get a dense and homogeneous dough .
Pour the dough into a 9-inch diameter baking pan greased and lined with parchment paper , leveling the surface with a spatula ; bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 60 minutes (or at 300°F for 50 minutes if in a fan oven). Once ready , remove the cake from the oven and let it cool.
Meanwhile, prepare the chocolate ganache. Chop the dark chocolate , then heat a saucepan with the cream . When the cream almost reaches a boil, turn off the heat and pour in the chopped chocolate, stirring with the whisks to completely melt it .
Once the chocolate has melted , transfer the mixture to a bowl containing ice and start whipping with an electric mixer (you can partially cover the container with plastic wrap to avoid splashes).
Work the ganache for 10-15 minutes until whipped , then transfer it to a piping bag with a star nozzle that you will place in the refrigerator. When the cake has completely cooled, cut it in half and fill the base disc with part of the chocolate ganache you prepared ;
After filling the base , place the top disc . With the remaining ganache, cover the cake , spreading it with a spatula over the entire surface to make it smooth.
Cover the sides of the cake well and with the remaining ganache, make the final decorations: make vertical squirts on the sides and then small tufts on the squirts, along the entire perimeter of the cake and in the center. Sprinkle the hazelnut grains every two tufts and the base, finally placing the dark chocolate truffles: your cocoa cake with chocolate ganache is ready to be served and enjoyed !
Store the soft cocoa cake with chocolate ganache for 1-2 days in the fridge in an airtight container. You can freeze the cake.
This cake is a real temptation, I bet it will be your ace up your sleeve to impress friends and family! It will be perfect to enjoy at snack time with a good hot tea or to celebrate an important occasion: you will leave everyone speechless!
