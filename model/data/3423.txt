Torcelli con tzatziki smirneico is this awesome fusion where Italian pasta teams up with the classic tzatziki recipe from Greek tradition. And seriously, you’ve got these tender, stuffed torcelli—typical pasta you often see in different parts of Italy—joined by a creamy and refreshing Greek yogurt dip . Now, the real star here? It’s gotta be the tzatziki smirneico. It’s a variant from the stunning coastal city of Smyrna, known today as Izmir. This sauce is all about fresh, simple ingredients: grated cucumber, thick Greek yogurt, a hint of garlic, and some chopped dill. Everything blends together into a smooth and tangy cucumber yogurt sauce that's really, really satisfying. Toss in some olives or a sprinkle of mint on top if you want a little extra flair.
This finger food is perfect as a traditional Greek appetizer , especially when you’re craving something homemade yet unique. And you know what? Some people like to serve the torcelli hot so the filling stays moist, while the tzatziki stays cool and crisp for dipping. Works great for any occasion, fitting in just as well at a casual get-together as it does at a big dinner. Here's the thing: the best part is how the flavors from the pasta and the easy tzatziki recipe interact. The pasta is soft and a bit chewy, while the dip is fresh and a little zippy from the garlic and dill. People often tweak the tzatziki with extra herbs or a splash of lemon juice—really makes it pop.
In the end, you’ve got a mix of Italian and Greek flavors in one bite, showing how these food traditions can blend. For sure. If you’re into Mediterranean dips or just looking for a simple way to level up snack time, this combo is pretty much unbeatable. And look, it’s a fun way to explore and celebrate the deliciousness of Greek cuisine right at home.
To prepare the torcelli with Smyrna-style tzatziki, wash the cucumber, cut off the ends, and coarsely grate it (keeping the skin) into a colander placed over a bowl . At this point, let it rest for at least 1 hour, so as to drain all the vegetation water and, after the necessary time, further squeeze the cucumber with the back of a spoon .
At this point, finely chop the garlic and crush it with the help of a mortar until you get a consistency as creamy as possible . Put the Greek yogurt in a bowl, then add the garlic and cucumber and mix using a spoon or whisk to combine the ingredients . Pour in the oil
and the white wine vinegar while continuing to mix . Meanwhile, finely chop the dill and add it to the mixture, then adjust the salt to taste . Mix all the ingredients well, and your tzatziki sauce is ready. Personalize your tzatziki by garnishing it with some olives and serve it with rustic torcelli .
Once prepared, you can store the tzatziki in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.
For the best result of this sauce, it is recommended to use Greek yogurt, but if you don't like it, you can prepare it using regular yogurt; you will need to strain it through cheesecloth to remove all excess whey and make it creamier. Tzatziki sauce also works great served with fish or meat.
