Japanese meat dumplings, gyoza, are a traditional dish of Japanese cuisine, similar to Chinese dumplings , but with a shape and filling that make them unique. The recipe for gyoza originated in China, where they are known as jiaozi, but it became popular in Japan, where the preparation was perfected and adapted to local tastes. These small and flavorful dumplings are perfect as an appetizer or main dish, ideal for sharing during a dinner with friends. The dough for gyoza is made with a simple combination of water and flour, giving the dumplings a soft and light texture. The rich and aromatic filling consists of ground pork, napa cabbage, spring onion, ginger, and soy sauce, which together create a balanced and tasty flavor. Gyoza are typically pan-fried, a method that makes them crispy on the bottom while remaining soft and juicy inside. However, they can also be steamed, cooked in broth, or fried, depending on the desired result. The recipe for Japanese meat dumplings is perfect for those who love preparing traditional dishes with a personal touch, and with each bite, you can taste the richness of oriental cuisine!

To prepare the Japanese meat dumplings (gyoza), start with the filling: chop the napa cabbage , then wash and chop the spring onion and grate the ginger .
In a bowl, combine the chopped cabbage, ground pork , spring onion, and ginger . Add salt , pepper, and pour in the rice wine.
Also add the water, sesame oil , and soy sauce. Mix with your hands , or with a spoon, until you obtain a homogeneous mixture . Let it marinate in the refrigerator for an hour, covering the bowl with plastic wrap.
Meanwhile, prepare the dough: in a bowl, place the flour and a pinch of salt , then gradually pour in the water , stirring with a spoon to incorporate it .
Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and knead by hand until you get a smooth and elastic dough ball . Let it rest for 30 minutes in a cool place, wrapped in plastic wrap. After the resting time, retrieve the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured work surface .
You need to obtain a sheet 1/16 inch thick . At this point, cut out circles with a 3-inch diameter cookie cutter . You can re-knead the scraps to form more dumplings. Fill each circle with a spoonful of filling .
Fold the circle in half , then pinch the dough along the entire edge, forming small pleats to close and seal the dumpling .
As they take shape, place the gyoza on a tray lined with parchment paper . With this quantity, you will get about 28 dumplings. Proceed to cook: pour a drizzle of vegetable oil into a pan, place the dumplings spacing them a little to avoid sticking during cooking . Let them brown on high heat, just enough to brown the bottom. At this point, pour water halfway up the dumpling .
Cover with a lid , lower the heat and let them cook for 10-12 minutes . Plate the gyoza gently with kitchen tongs .
Season with soy sauce and chopped spring onion to taste . Serve your homemade Japanese meat dumplings (gyoza) immediately !
Gyoza can be stored in the refrigerator, either raw or cooked, for up to 2 days.
They can be frozen: arrange them on a tray, without overlapping, and put them in the freezer. Once frozen, transfer them to freezer bags. This way, you can keep them for up to 3 months.
If you want to give a personal touch to your gyoza, experiment with different fillings: shrimp, chicken, vegetables for a vegetarian version, tofu for a vegan choice. You can also enrich them with spices like curry, paprika, or chives.
