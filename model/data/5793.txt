Enhance your holiday menu with other enticing appetizers :
To prepare the Blinis with Caviar, first start with the blini batter. Separate the yolk from the egg white . In a bowl, beat the egg whites with a whisk until they form stiff peaks , then set them aside.
Now, using the same electric mixer, beat the yolk with the milk and the cream . Gradually add the flour and continue to mix.
Combine the previously sifted yeast , blending it into the rest with a whisk. Then add salt . Now gently fold in the beaten egg whites, a little at a time, being very careful not to deflate them, mixing with a spatula from the bottom up .
Once you achieve a smooth mixture , proceed to cooking. Lightly grease a non-stick pan with a bit of butter . Pour a small ladleful of batter for each blini .
Let it cook for about 2-3 minutes , then flip to the other side and continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes until golden brown .
Store the ready-made blinis on a serving platter . Now, move on to the filling: season the shrimp with salt, oil, pepper , and the lime zest . Set aside.
Now cut the avocado in half, remove the pit , and with a spoon scoop out the flesh into a bowl . Squeeze the juice of half a lime and mash with a fork. Season with salt .
In a pan, pour a drizzle of oil, the garlic, and some sprigs of thyme. Add the shrimp and sauté them over high heat for 2-3 minutes. Assemble the blinis: fill them with the avocado cream .
Place the shrimp and caviar on top, complete with a few pomegranate seeds and thyme leaves. The caviar blinis are ready to be enjoyed .
We recommend consuming the caviar blinis immediately.
You can prepare the blinis in advance and fill them just before serving.
You can vary the filling cream by using spreadable fresh cheese as an alternative to the avocado cream.
