To prepare tagliatelle with orange, start by chopping the chives and set them aside . Then proceed to peel the oranges with a vegetable peeler , trying to take only the outer part of the peel, avoiding the more bitter white part. Then cut the peel of 1 orange into julienne strips , while the other can be left whole.
In a large pan, heat the oil with the butter over very low heat and when the latter is melted, add the julienned orange peel and lightly brown it, stirring occasionally; while the whole peel can be dropped into a pot with hot water . Boil the peels so that they release their aroma.
In the meantime, in a bowl, pour the yolks (they should be very fresh) and add the room temperature water , then beat them with a fork ; adjust the salt .
and pepper . Drain the orange peels , then let the water return to a boil while you prepare the pasta to dunk as soon as it reaches temperature. At this point, cook the tagliatelle for 3-4 minutes or for the time indicated on the package in the same water in which you boiled the peels .
Then drain the tagliatelle with a slotted spoon and transfer them directly into the pan where you sautéed the julienned orange peels ; mix with a spatula and season with the chives .
Then pour in the beaten yolks with the water and quickly mix over low heat. Then turn off the heat, add the grated Grana Padano DOP and serve the tagliatelle with orange hot !
It is recommended to consume the tagliatelle with orange as soon as they are ready.
They can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 1 day.

Avoid sautéing the tagliatelle over high heat, as they may dry out too much; you can keep a little pasta cooking water aside and, if needed, add it to the sauce to dilute it.
