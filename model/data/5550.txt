instructions:
Barley salad with anchovies, shrimp, and cherry tomatoes is a great alternative to the usual rice salad. Barley is an excellent substitute for rice, both for preparing tasty barley salads and delicious barley risottos; it is tasty, light, and crunchy, and this simple summer recipe enhances all the sea flavors within it... try it also in the winter version with kale !
To prepare the barley salad with anchovies, shrimp, and cherry tomatoes, start by boiling the barley in 1.5 quarts of boiling water . Meanwhile, wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them into quarters , then melt the anchovies in the oil over the heat for a few moments; add the shrimp and sear them for a few seconds .
When the barley is cooked (remember it should remain slightly crunchy), drain it well and toss it in the pot with the previously prepared ingredients . Remove everything from the heat, let it cool, then add the cherry tomatoes and the basil leaves torn by hand ; add another dash of raw oil, pepper to taste, and mix well. Let it rest and cool completely, then place the barley salad with anchovies, shrimp, and cherry tomatoes in the refrigerator for at least an hour.
To serve this barley salad in a fun and appealing way, place it in single-serving bowls (as you can see in the large photo above), or you can serve it in small glasses as an accompaniment to an aperitif.
