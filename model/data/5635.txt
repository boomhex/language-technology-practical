A translation of 'fruit of the sea,' this pasta dish brimming with seafood is a celebrated staple you'll encounter in nearly every dining establishment on the scenic island of Capri. Inspired by the region's culinary traditions, celebrity chef Giada De Laurentiis offers her own take on this timeless classic. She infuses the dish with homemade chili oil, introducing a bold, pervasive heat that complements the fresh flavors of lobster tails, shrimp, and clams, all simmered in a savory tomato sauce. This version not only captures the essence of Capri but also adds a spicy twist that elevates the entire dining experience.
