instructions:
To prepare the shrimp skewers with lime, honey, and poppy seeds, start by cleaning the shrimp: remove the heads from the crustaceans and remove the carapace (shell) . Then, slice the limes
Thread four shrimp onto each skewer, alternating them with a slice of lime (thus 4 shrimp and 3 lime slices per skewer for a total of 8 skewers) (4-5). Meanwhile, heat a dash of oil in a pan
and when it is hot, sauté the skewers briefly, turning them seconds per side, add the honey, and caramelize well on both sides . Remove the skewers from the heat and place them on a large dish, sprinkle them with poppy seeds on both sides , and keep them warm.
Squeeze the juice from two limes and in the pan where you browned the skewers, add the lime juice to the cooking juices and let it reduce for a moment. Then dissolve the cornstarch in water .
and pour it into the pan along with the white wine , stirring until the liquid has a creamy appearance. Add a tablespoon of granulated sugar
and one of brown sugar . Mix everything with a wooden spoon and let it thicken. Then pour the creamy mixture over the shrimp skewers with lime, honey, and poppy seeds and serve them!
It is recommended to consume the shrimp skewers as soon as they are ready. They can be stored in the refrigerator for about 12 hours covered with plastic wrap.
You can also serve the shrimp skewers with lime, honey, and poppy seeds as an appetizer by skewering them into a support made from half a Sorrento lemon (larger and more fragrant than common ones) and reducing the portion to one skewer per person.
