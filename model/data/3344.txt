Sfoglie alle olive con pesto e ricotta is like something straight out of a kitchen in Liguria . You know, up in northwestern Italy where the coast meets those rolling hills. People there are always dreaming up smart ways to use their good ingredients. Really really good stuff. This is one of those easy puff pastry recipes that somehow just hits different—because it’s so simple. What you get are these crispy little baked pastries packed with a big burst of Mediterranean flavor from olives and pesto. Plus, you get that creamy touch from the ricotta. Seriously good.
The pesto? It’s a classic in this region—basil, garlic, pine nuts, and cheese. So, spreading it on these puff pastry appetizers just makes sense. It’s also a great way to use up leftover pesto you might have chilling in the fridge. Everything bakes until the pastry gets all golden and light. And listen, the whole thing’s finished with more olives and a sprinkle of pine nuts for that extra bit of crunch and taste that feels super Italian.
If you’re into snacks that are quick and look amazing, this one’s for you. You’ll find these at aperitivo, when friends just drop by and you need a plate of Italian-inspired appetizers that look good and taste even better. There’s something about the way the moist ricotta mixes with fresh pesto—so so good—that brings out the bright, tangy flavors of the olives. Every bite is interesting. Pretty much.
Folks in Liguria love these kinds of savory pastry recipes . Why? Because they make the most of what’s already in the kitchen—no waste, just smart cooking. The pine nuts on top, with that tender pastry, give you a little bit of everything: salty, sweet, nutty, and fresh. Whether you call them olive pesto ricotta tarts or just a super tasty snack, these pastries are always a hit at gatherings. They’re proof that you don’t need much to make something special—just a few solid flavors and some oven time. Enjoy them as a little reminder of the beautiful simplicity of Ligurian cuisine. For real.
To prepare the olive puff pastries with pesto and ricotta, start by making a good homemade pesto: place the washed and well-dried basil, grated cheeses , pine nuts, a pinch of salt, and extra virgin olive oil into a mortar (or food processor), then crush with the pestle (or blend in the mixer) until you obtain a creamy sauce .
If necessary, add a little more oil. Place the pesto obtained in a small bowl and add the ricotta , mix to combine everything, and put the mixture in a piping bag. Put a bit of pesto and ricotta sauce on each olive puff pastry and decorate with some olive slices and pine nuts.
