instructions:
To prepare the summer savory pie, start by unrolling the puff pastry directly onto the baking tray. Fold the edges of the pastry about half an inch inward . Prick the base with a fork and brush with milk .
Bake the base in a preheated fan oven at 400°F for about 10 minutes. When it is golden on the edges, remove it from the oven and let it cool . Meanwhile, prepare the pesto: in the blender, combine the basil leaves, washed and dried , and the pine nuts .
Add the garlic with the core removed , the grated Pecorino and Parmesan , and the coarse salt .
Finally, pour the oil and blend intermittently (so as not to overheat the mixture) until you obtain a homogeneous sauce .
Spread the pesto all over the pastry base . Cut the tomato into very thin slices and place them on the surface, slightly overlapping them .
Distribute the stracciatella over the tomatoes and finally garnish with basil leaves, a pinch of salt, and a drizzle of oil . Your summer savory pie is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the summer savory pie immediately.
Feel free to enrich your summer savory pie: replace the basil pesto with Arugula Pesto or Zucchini pesto , or the fresh tomatoes with sun-dried tomatoes in oil!
