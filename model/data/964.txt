instructions:
To prepare the whole wheat focaccia with sourdough, pour the whole wheat flour and bread flour into the bowl of a stand mixer equipped with a hook , add the sourdough that was refreshed within the previous 24 hours and the water and turn on to obtain a smooth dough.
Now add the salt and the oil and work everything for about 10 minutes until they are completely absorbed. When the dough is smooth and well combined, place it on a floured work surface .
Round the dough by rolling it between your hands to obtain a regular spherical shape , then transfer it into a bowl. At this point, start the first fold, lifting one edge of the dough and bringing it towards the center .
Turn the bowl, take another edge of the dough and bring it to the center , then turn the bowl again and repeat the operation 2 more times, for a total of 4 folds. Cover the bowl with a cloth and let the dough rest for 15 minutes, then repeat the 4 folds. Cover the bowl again and let it rest for another 15 minutes before performing 4 more folds for the third and last time. At this point, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature, away from drafts, for 6 hours. After this time, place the bowl in the refrigerator and let the dough mature for 18 hours.
After the maturation time, remove the dough from the refrigerator and spread it with your hands in a well-oiled 14x11 inch pan . Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature for another 2 hours .
In the meantime, prepare the emulsion by pouring the oil and water into a small bowl and mixing with a fork. Once risen, imprint indentations on the focaccia by pressing your fingertips into the dough; if it seems difficult, you can oil your hands . Pour the emulsion, distributing it over the entire surface .
Finally, sprinkle with rosemary and coarse salt to taste . Bake in a preheated static oven at 410°F for about 30 minutes. Once ready, enjoy your whole wheat focaccia with sourdough while still warm or let it cool on a rack !
The whole wheat focaccia with sourdough can be kept for 2 days at room temperature. It can be frozen after cooking and completely cooled.
You can sprinkle the surface with mixed seeds to add a crunchy note!
