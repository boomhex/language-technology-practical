instructions:
Coffee pastry cream is a variation of the traditional custard cream , flavored with coffee. The procedure is the same as the classic cream, as is its consistency, which makes it an excellent base for filling cakes like sponge cake and for preparing filled pastries and desserts. Have fun varying the flavors of this delicious cream and try other versions like Rum custard cream , pistachio cream , and Custard with Whole Eggs ! And if you're a fan of coffee desserts, also try our water-based coffee cream !
Simmer the milk (except half a cup) in a large saucepan , then remove it from the heat, add the instant coffee , and stir until it dissolves in the milk .
In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks with the sugar using an electric mixer until you obtain a frothy cream ; gradually pour a third of the warm milk into the egg mixture in a thin stream .
Then slowly incorporate the sifted flour . Continue beating with the electric mixer and, in the saucepan with the milk, gradually add the egg, flour, and sugar mixture, stirring with a whisk (8-9).
At this point, bring everything to a boil, and while continuously stirring , let it simmer gently for a few minutes, continuously whisking to prevent lumps, alternating with the addition of the cold milk you set aside (half a cup), until the mixture thickens . Turn off the heat and let the cream cool, stirring occasionally. Store the cream in a container, covering it with plastic wrap so it is in contact with the surface to prevent a skin from forming .
