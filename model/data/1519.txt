Get ready to enjoy fried shrimp with a twist, featuring a mango sauce that's both fun and flavorful. These shrimp are coated in a mix of panko and corn flakes, making each bite super crispy and crunchy. Really, really good stuff. The panko bread crumbs—lighter and airier—give a crunch like Japanese tempura. Once fried, they turn a golden color, but stay tender inside. And the sauce? A tropical, sweet mango mix with a hit of chili and chive. So, so tasty. You get that balance of tangy and spicy, transforming your shrimp experience into a mini vacation at your dining table.
For holidays and parties, this shrimp appetizer is a hit. It's what everyone reaches for—and look—it's gone in no time. The crispy shrimp paired with the zesty mango sauce creates a special bite without needing anything too fancy. It might remind some of sweet and sour shrimp, but here's the thing: the fresh mango and chili offer a brighter flavor. Unlike traditional Italian appetizers, like shrimp ceviche, this fusion dish is different—global and playful, for sure. The panko and corn flake combo gives it standout crunch. The homemade sauce makes it seem like you went the extra mile, even though it’s quick to make.
Whether served as a starter at a family dinner or at a party, this seafood recipe ensures everyone tastes something fresh, spicy, and a little unexpected. Pretty much perfect for any festive occasion, delivering a really good surprise with its tropical vibes and strong taste. And you know, that's the fun part.
To prepare the shrimp fry with mango sauce, start by peeling the fruit . Then roughly chop the pulp . Next, peel the piece of ginger
In a small bowl, pour the mango pulp and grate the fresh ginger , add the extra virgin olive oil and blend everything with an immersion blender .
Chop a fresh chili and the chives and add them to the sauce (8-9),
set the sauce aside. Move on to the shrimp: remove the shells and the internal vein (10-11), rinse the shrimp under running water and pat them dry with paper towels. Then prepare the bowls for the coating: in one, pour the flour, in another the panko, in another the corn flakes, and in the last one, the lightly beaten eggs with a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper.
First, pass the shrimp tails in the flour , then in the beaten eggs . To achieve the right crispiness, make sure the panko adheres well .
Then dip the shrimp tails back into the eggs and finally roll them in the corn flakes . While doing these steps with all the shrimp tails, place them on a tray and meanwhile, heat the seed oil in a large pan until it reaches 330°F (to be checked with a kitchen thermometer).
Fry a maximum of 3 shrimp at a time so that the oil temperature does not drop too much. As soon as they take on color - it will take a maximum of 2 minutes - drain them and place them on absorbent paper. Season them with some lime zest . Serve your shrimp fry with mango sauce .
Fried shrimp are best consumed immediately.
The mango sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
You can replace the mango sauce with a simple homemade mayonnaise, an eggless faux mayonnaise, or a papaya sauce to maintain the exotic touch!
