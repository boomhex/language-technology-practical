To prepare stuffed squid with vegetables and shrimp, start by cleaning the squids: gently detach the tentacles and remove the cartilage pen. Then rinse the mantle well to remove the innards; remove the eyes and the central tooth from the tentacles, then set the tentacles aside. Then How to clean shrimp : detach the head
remove the shrimp shell and set them aside : with the heads and shells you can prepare the stock: clean and slice the onion , also slice the leek, then in a pot pour the water, the onion, the leek, half a garlic clove, the shrimp heads and shells, the parsley, the whole peppercorns .
Place everything on medium heat , let it cook and from time to time remove the residues that form on the surface using a skimmer. While the stock cooks, focus on the vegetables: rinse the peppers, remove the cap, cut them in half and remove the inner seeds . Then cut them into half-inch strips .
Proceed in the same way with the carrots, previously trimmed and peeled and remove the ends from the green beans. Then join three strips of different colors and cut them to even them out . In a large pan, sauté the garlic with some rosemary sprigs , add the peppers
the green beans and the carrots , sauté the mixture for about 3-4 minutes over low heat. Place 5 strips of alternating colored vegetables on a rectangle of plastic wrap , then lay two shrimp
and cover again with more vegetable strips , then roll up the film to seal the vegetables, leaving the ends free , then insert them into the squid mantle : this way it will be easier to create the filling
gently remove the film and repeat the same operations for all the squids . Oil a large pan, place the squids and turn on low heat, then deglaze with white wine .
Turn the squids to the other side then strain the stock and pour it over the squids .
Cover with a lid and cook for about 15 minutes . In another pot pour a drizzle of oil, add the peas and the thyme .
Also pour in the water and cook the peas for about 20 minutes. Once cooked, blend them to obtain a smooth cream. Pour it as a base on serving plates and lay the stuffed squids with vegetables and shrimp for your guests to enjoy!
