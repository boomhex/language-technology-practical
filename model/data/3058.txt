Confettura di mele e arance al pepe rosa is this super tasty apple orange jam with a twist—pink peppercorn! To be honest, it’s not your typical fruit spread. In Italy, especially up north, people really really love mixing apples—because they're rich in pectin—with fresh oranges for that zesty and tangy kick. And look, the star here? It's the pink peppercorn jam bit. Seriously, it adds a light spicy touch that just goes so well with the fruitiness. You end up with this balanced blend of sweet, slightly sour, and a nice warmth that really wakes up your taste buds. It’s familiar yet new. Great on toasted bread in the morning, or pair it with mild cheese—because why not? It lets the jam shine without taking over.

If you love classic apple orange marmalade or are into trying new flavors, this jam is your go-to for creativity without any fuss.

To prepare the apple and orange jam with pink pepper , first wash the apples under running water . Use a peeler to peel the apples ,
remove the stem , cut them into quarters, and also remove the core with a small knife . Using a grater with large holes, grate the apples ,
collecting them in a large bowl . Now peel the oranges by cutting off the two ends with a small knife (8-9);
then, slice the peel lengthwise without cutting into the flesh and peel them completely . Divide the oranges into segments and cut each segment in half . Get a food mill with large holes and set it over a large bowl to collect the juice and pulp of the fruit; pour the orange segments into the food mill
and process them gently to squeeze all the segments . Finely chop 1 tablespoon of pink pepper using a sharp knife ; alternatively, you can use a food processor.
Leave another tablespoon of pink peppercorns whole . In a large, tall stainless steel pot, pour in the grated apples , the orange juice and
finally add the pink pepper, both the chopped and the whole peppercorns . These steps should be done with the heat off. In a bowl, place 500 grams of granulated sugar and add 1 packet of Fruttapec 2:1 , then mix the two ingredients with a spoon .
Add the sugar with the Fruttapec cold to the fruit, directly in the pot . Bring the mixture to a boil, keeping the flame high and continuing to stir to prevent it from sticking to the bottom . When the mixture reaches a boil, let it boil for 3 minutes on high heat, always stirring .
Remove the pot from the heat and stir to dissolve any foam . Prepare the jars, which you have sanitized, and get a funnel to facilitate pouring the jam . Pour the hot jam into the jars using a ladle and
continue to pour until the jars are filled to the brim then, with the appropriate lids, close them
tightening well and ensuring they are hermetically sealed . Turn the jars upside down while still hot for 5 minutes; this way, a vacuum will be created, and the lids will also be sterilized . Your apple and orange jam with pink pepper is ready: once it has reached room temperature, remember to label the jar to make it recognizable .
The apple and orange jam with pink pepper can be stored in a cool, dry place, away from light and heat sources, for about 12 months. Once opened, the apple and orange jam with pink pepper should be stored in the refrigerator and consumed within a few days; for this reason, we recommend storing the jam in small jars so that the content can be used quickly once opened.
The apple and orange jam with pink pepper pairs very well with delicate cheeses, such as goat cheese.
Homemade preparation of preserves and jams can pose health risks. In a domestic setting, it is not possible to create the conditions and measures necessary to ensure the safety and suitability of the food, which, on the other hand, industrial processes can guarantee to prevent dangerous contamination. It is therefore important to follow food safety guidelines meticulously to reduce risks, but one must always keep in mind that the same food safety level of professionally produced preserves and jams can never be achieved. For correct preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
