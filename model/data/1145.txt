instructions:
To make the cocoa cookies without eggs, place the room temperature butter and muscovado sugar in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment . Turn on the machine and work everything until you get a homogeneous mixture .
Incorporate the flour , cocoa , and salt flakes.
Flavor with vanilla extract and mix again with the whisks. While the mixer is on, slowly pour in the milk and continue until absorbed
Take about 16/18 grams (0.56/0.63 oz) of dough, shape into balls with your hands , working quickly to avoid warming the dough too much, and place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper ; you will get about 35 cookies. In a small bowl, mix the chocolate chips with the salt flakes .
Decorate the surface of the cookies with the chocolate and fleur de sel . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 18 minutes. Once baked, remove the cocoa cookies without eggs from the oven and let them cool slightly before enjoying them .
Store the cocoa cookies without eggs in a tin box for 4 days. You can freeze the raw dough or the baked cookies.
Flavor your cookies with ginger powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, or other spices of your choice!
