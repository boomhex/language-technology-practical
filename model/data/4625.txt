To prepare the roasted duck breast with port and orange reduction, first score the skin with a knife or a razor blade ; it is important to cut only the skin without reaching the meat. Place the duck breast in a steel pan with the skin side down , then turn on the heat and cook on low flame for 10-15 minutes.
Turn the meat only when it has released all of its fat and detaches easily from the bottom ; cooking time may vary depending on how thick the breast is. At this point, add the butter , thyme, and rosemary sprigs .
Also add the unpeeled garlic . Continue cooking the duck breast by basting the meat with the cooking juices ; if you place the herbs on the meat, they will avoid burning during cooking. The meat will be ready when it reaches an internal temperature between 140°F and 165°F. Transfer it to a wire rack along with the herbs .
Baste it with the cooking juices and let it rest for 10 minutes. In the meantime, prepare the port and orange reduction. In a saucepan, melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter taken from the total, then add the chopped shallot and let it soften over medium heat for 5-6 minutes .
When the shallot has softened, pour in the Marsala and Port and let all the alcohol evaporate; to speed up the process, you can flambé with a blowtorch .
Once the sauce has reduced its volume by half, you can strain it through a sieve to achieve a smoother consistency . Then add the orange juice and continue to reduce the mixture on the heat until it has a consistency that coats the spoon. Finally, turn off the heat and add the remaining butter to thicken and glaze the reduction ; you should obtain a compound with the consistency of a glaze.
While the sauce is cooking, you can work on the side dish: cut the endive in half and place it in the pan where you cooked the duck, with the cut side down . Add a few knobs of butter .
Add a pinch of sugar and the white vinegar to deglaze the pan . Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, then turn and cook for another 5 minutes . The endive should slightly caramelize while maintaining a crunchy texture.
You are ready to plate: cut the duck breast lengthwise and add the endive alongside . Season the meat with salt flakes .
Finally, garnish with grated orange zest , thyme , and a few pieces of orange segments .
Complete with a grind of pepper and the reduction . The duck breast with port and orange reduction is ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the roasted duck breast with port and orange reduction immediately. If necessary, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 days in an airtight container.
If you have time, place the duck breast in the refrigerator on a wire rack and let it dry for 1-2 days: this way, the skin will become even crispier during cooking!
Adjust the amount of orange juice for the reduction according to your taste.
As an alternative to caramelized endive, you can serve a side of sweet potato puree or Jerusalem artichoke cream.
