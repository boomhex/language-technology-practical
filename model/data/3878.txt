Loaded with COLOR and flavor, blueberry risotto delivers a creamy texture that busy families and home cooks find hard to resist. Families love the soft , just-right bite of arborio rice cooking techniques , offering a distinctive take on classic risotto recipes. Plump wild blueberries bring a tangy-sweet contrast, making every bite pleasantly fruity and giving your dinner table something special. Bright color and nice glossy look make this wild blueberry risotto a natural conversation starter at gatherings or even weekday meals. Since it's naturally vegetarian, this dish fits well for meatless nights, but it's also a smart choice as a side for fish or chicken —kids even tend to ask for seconds. Fresh chive flavor mixes in beautifully, giving your meal a simple gourmet twist that’s sure to grab everyone's attention.
Families looking for something different often turn to chive risotto with blueberries, since it blends sweet notes with classic savory appeal—feels FRESH without being overly fancy. The moist consistency is always satisfying...especially when shared as a vegetarian risotto on nights when you want something easy but still feels special. Works just as well for relaxed family dinners or bigger celebrations, and the added soft color from blueberries just looks FUN on the plate. Really nice with a green salad or a simple main (chicken, fish—you name it), this risotto with wine stays DELICIOUS even if you want to serve it warm or slightly cooled. Home cooks usually like that it’s flexible: a go-to for quick weeknights or something a little different for guests. Finished with a handful of chives or sprinkled parmesan, this risotto brings real everyday comfort in a way that busy families and regular bakers appreciate—reliable, pretty, and just plain GOOD every time you bring it out.
First, prepare the vegetable broth by placing a cleaned carrot, an onion, a celery stalk, and two bay leaves in a large saucepan, pour 1.2 liters (about 5 cups) of water and bring to a boil; let it boil for about 15-20 minutes, season with salt, and keep warm for cooking the risotto. Clean the blueberries, set aside at least a couple per diner for decoration, and place the remaining ones in a small saucepan with about 2 tbsp of butter and cook on very low heat for 10 minutes , or until the blueberries break down .
In a saucepan, melt the remaining butter and toast the rice with the chopped chives for a couple of minutes over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon ; deglaze with the glass of red wine , let the alcohol evaporate and then start adding the broth a couple of ladles at a time, stirring gently with the spoon; in the meantime, puree the blueberries with an immersion blender .
When the rice is almost cooked, after about 15 minutes, pass the obtained puree through a sieve and add it to the rice . Finish cooking, if necessary, add a ladle of broth. Turn off the heat, add a generous knob of butter and stir the risotto, mixing so that the butter melts with the heat of the rice; let it rest for another minute without stirring and serve by plating the rice and decorating each dish with a couple of blueberries and a chive stem.
We prepared this dish with Lagrein red wine from Trentino, with the scent of violet and wild berries, also excellent to drink to accompany this risotto, but you can opt for any fruity red wine; if you wish, you can sprinkle the risotto with grated cheese or bring it to the table anyway and let the diners decide whether to use it.
The blueberry blooms in May and bears fruit in July-August with black berries, with colored flesh and covered with bloom. It grows wild in Europe and can be found in the Alps and the Apennines up to Abruzzo.
