instructions:
To make penne all’arrabbiata , start by draining the peeled tomatoes. Transfer them to a bowl and crush them with a fork to break them up .
Next, crumble the dried chili . Place a pot full of water, salted to taste, on the stove to cook the pasta. Meanwhile, pour a drizzle of oil into a pan and add the peeled garlic clove .
Now add the chili and fry it lightly over low heat , then add the tomatoes .
Stir it and add salt to taste . Cover the pan with a lid and let this sauce cook for around 12 minutes, stirring every so often.
When the sauce is nearly ready, put the pasta on to cook as well. Cook it al dente, following the cooking times stated on the packaging . Once 12 minutes have passed, take the lid off the pan and remove the garlic .
Drain the pasta and pour it directly into the sauce . Heat through for a minute , adding some of the cooking water if necessary , then turn off the heat.
Add the chopped parsley , stir once more , and serve your penne all'arrabbiata while still hot .
We recommend eating the penne all’arrabbiata as soon as you’ve made it. Alternatively, you can keep it for one day in the fridge.
Use fresh chili instead of dried and garnish every plate with Pecorino Romano cheese!
