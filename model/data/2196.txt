From the sunny Ligurian coast, pasta with calamari brings together the best of Italian seaside cooking and a bit of kitchen magic. Really. Bavette, a pasta shape you see a lot in Liguria, holds the tender squid just right. Every bite feels like a walk along the Mediterranean, you know? Cherry tomatoes burst with a sweet pop, and fresh basil adds that green, herby hit. Italian food gets it so right. Crushed hazelnuts slip into the mix for a little crispy surprise, giving this seafood pasta recipe a mix of flavors and textures you don’t find every day. And look, people in Liguria love dishes that look just as lively as they taste. This one totally nails it. Seriously. With its sunny colors and eye-catching finish, it’s a feast for the eyes and taste buds. Topping it off, the grated hard-boiled egg yolk—bright as mimosa flowers—isn’t just pretty. It brings a rich layer to the calamari pasta dish that feels both clever and classic at the same time.
In Liguria, cooks have a knack for taking simple, local stuff and turning it into something that feels a bit special. This seafood pasta recipe really works for anyone who’s after big flavor but doesn’t want anything fussy. The combination of squid, basil and nuts in a quick, tomato-based sauce gives you those moist bites of pasta you can’t wait to dig into. Plus, the egg yolk isn’t just for looks—it melts over the pasta, making everything extra creamy. And here's the thing: it gives a little nod to how Italian chefs love to play with tradition. Sometimes, folks swap out the nuts or add a hint of lemon zest, which is great, but the heart of the dish is always about showing off fresh seafood in the best way. Serve this pasta with calamari at a weekend lunch or a cozy dinner and watch people light up when they spot those golden specks of yolk over the noodles. It’s a real celebration of Ligurian tastes, color, and a little bit of kitchen joy, all on one plate. This dish not only has Italian flair but also invites everyone to savor the art of simple yet impressive cooking. So, so good.
To prepare the pasta with squid and hard-boiled yolk, start by cooking the hard-boiled eggs. Fill a saucepan with plenty of cold water, immerse the eggs . From the moment it boils, count about 9 minutes (it also depends on the size of the eggs, we used medium eggs), the time needed to cook them. Then turn off the heat, pass the saucepan under fresh running water to cool them, and peel them . Score the egg white with a small knife ,
separate the whites from the hard-boiled yolks (4-5) and sift the latter through a sieve with the help of a teaspoon or a fork
to obtain crumbs that you can set aside in a small bowl . Move on to cleaning the squid (we used a large squid, but you can use smaller squid, reaching the indicated weight). Rinse the squid under running water, then gently detach the head from the mantle with your hands, remove the innards . Remove the outer skin: score the end of the mantle with a small knife, just enough to grab an edge of the skin and completely pull off the covering with your hands .
Dry the squid with a paper towel and cut it lengthwise to divide it into two parts , then cut it into thin strips (12-13)
Once ready, set them aside ; move on to the cherry tomatoes: cut them in half . Roughly chop the hazelnuts with a knife .
Pour the chopped hazelnuts into a pan and toast them over moderate heat for a few minutes . Set aside the toasted hazelnuts and in the same pan heat the olive oil with the whole garlic cloves ,
let them flavor, then remove the garlic and add the squid strips . Deglaze with white wine , let cook for 1-2 minutes
then add the cherry tomatoes , stir , salt and pepper, and cook for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring salted water to a boil in a tall-edged pot and cook the linguine for about 8 minutes .
Drain the pasta al dente directly into the pan with the seasoning , stir, then add the toasted hazelnuts ; finally chop the fresh basil
turn off the heat and add it to the pasta to give fragrance to the dish. Stir and plate, then serve garnishing each plate with the crumbled yolk . The pasta with squid and hard-boiled yolk is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the pasta with squid and hard-boiled yolk immediately; if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator for up to one day in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
