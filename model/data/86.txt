To prepare the puff pastry mini pizzas in air fryer, first cut the pizza mozzarella into very small cubes . Now unroll the puff pastry and cut out circles with a pastry cutter 2.5 inches in diameter . Place the puff pastry discs on the cutting board and top them with the tomato sauce .
Spread evenly using the back of a spoon , then add the mozzarella cubes . Transfer the topped mini pizzas to the air fryer basket and cook at 300°F for 6 minutes.
Meanwhile, make the arugula pesto: place the washed and dried arugula in a mixer with blades , then add the peeled almonds and grated Pecorino cheese .
Finally, add the oil and salt and blend until you achieve a creamy but fairly rustic consistency .
Once cooked , garnish the puff pastry mini pizzas with a few drops of arugula pesto . Your puff pastry mini pizzas in air fryer are ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the air fryer mini pizzas immediately. Alternatively, you can store them in the fridge for 2 days and warm them in the oven before serving.
You can freeze them once cooked and cooled.
