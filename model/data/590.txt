instructions:
To make the black cabbage and mussels risotto, first cut the black cabbage into strips, removing the toughest stems . Proceed to the How to Clean and Open Mussels : first, discard any broken or open ones, then remove encrustations with a knife, pull off the beard , and scrub the shell with a steel wool pad .
In a large saucepan, heat the oil with the garlic , allowing a nice bunch of parsley to sizzle . Then add the mussels .
Deglaze with white wine , cover with the lid , and cook over high heat for 4-5 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally. When all the mussels have opened, turn off the heat and let cool . Remove the bunch of parsley.
In the meantime, bring a pot of water to a boil and blanch the black cabbage for about 5 minutes . Drain it without discarding the cooking water (keep it warm, it will be used to cook the risotto) and transfer it to a bowl with ice water to maintain its vivid color .
Shell the mussels . Put the shellfish in a bowl along with some of their cooking liquid ; the remaining liquid will be used to cook the rice. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside .
At this point, you can start preparing the risotto: toast the whole grain rice in a saucepan with a drizzle of oil for 4-5 minutes , stirring often . Deglaze with the reserved mussel liquid .
Cook the rice by adding the hot black cabbage broth, one ladle at a time . Meanwhile, drain the black cabbage and transfer it to a container , then blend it with an immersion blender to make a cream .
When there are 5 minutes left until the rice is done, add the black cabbage cream . Stir well and finish cooking the risotto, adding more broth as needed . Once ready, season with pink pepper .
Add the mussels and stir gently, then turn off the heat and stir in a drizzle of raw oil . Your black cabbage and mussels risotto is ready to be served !
The black cabbage and mussels risotto can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day, in an airtight container.
Experiment with other tasty variations by replacing the black cabbage with broccoli, spinach, or chard!
