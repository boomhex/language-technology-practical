When spring shows up in Northern Italy , markets are just bursting with baskets of zucchini flowers —those delicate and bright yellow blooms. They're like a little sign that winter's finally over. Zucchini blossom risotto is something locals really really look forward to. Instead of regular zucchini, this dish focuses on the flowers, chopped and mixed into creamy rice. Really good stuff. Every bite is silky and light. In regions like Lombardy or Veneto, they finish the risotto using mantecatura. Thing is, instead of the usual butter, a scoop of ricotta and some grated pecorino are stirred in. The rice gets that classic “all’onda” wave—meaning it stays creamy and moves slightly when you shake the plate. And look, this mix of creamy cheese and fresh blossoms makes the zucchini flower risotto just pop with color. Perfect for anyone who loves traditional Italian risotto but wants something fresh.
What's cool about this dish? It's the texture play. Some zucchini blossoms are folded right into the rice, while others are fried until they're crispy and golden. Then they're sprinkled on top as a finishing touch. So good. You get the soft, moist rice and those crunchy bites that make every forkful interesting. Even as a vegetarian dish, it’s anything but dull. It’s like a garden-fresh risotto made when veggies are at their peak. Pretty much.
There are plenty of variations. Some families toss in mortadella for a richer flavor, or even shrimp for a seafood twist. And in Emilia-Romagna, zucchini blossoms might appear in tagliatelle. But really, for a true taste of the season, squash blossom risotto keeps it simple. Just letting the veggies shine. It’s a go-to for big Sunday lunches or standout spring dinners. And always paired with extra pecorino on top and a drizzle of quality olive oil. For those curious about summer risotto recipes or just in the mood for something that captures the heart of spring on a plate, this one's a real winner. No question.
