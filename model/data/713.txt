instructions:
To prepare the fried eggs with mushrooms and tomatoes, start by cleaning the mushrooms: after cutting off the earthy part from the base, scrape the cap with a paper towel , or a damp cloth. Slice them thinly about a quarter of an inch . Also cut the sun-dried tomatoes, drained of their preserving oil, into 2-3 pieces .

In a skillet with oil, heat the garlic and rosemary . Then add the mushrooms and after a quick sauté, add salt, this way the water from the vegetables will be released. As soon as it has almost completely evaporated
remove the garlic and rosemary , add the sun-dried tomatoes and sauté briefly; set the mushrooms aside and leave the base in the skillet.
While the mushrooms cook, slice the bread , place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and sprinkle the surface with oil, salt, pepper, and a pinch of smoked paprika and toast in a preheated oven at 392°F, in the upper part (not in direct contact with the heating element) for about 5-6 minutes .
When everything is ready, cook the eggs: break two eggs into the skillet with the base , if you prefer, do it in a small bowl to avoid breaking the yolk. Cook for the time you think is right (about 3-4 minutes at most, just enough time for the whites to set and the yolk to remain creamy enough). Once the whites have set, add the garnish to the skillet, pepper , salt, and finally enjoy immediately the fried eggs with mushrooms and tomatoes, served with the toasted bread .
It is recommended to consume immediately.
Sun-dried tomatoes can be replaced with fresh ones if in season, choose varieties not too rich in seeds (like cherry or grape tomatoes). When preparing fried eggs, leave the eggs at room temperature for even cooking.
