One leads to another, and their sweetness has inspired many recipes: we are naturally talking about cherries! Cakes , tarts , Cherry and Vanilla Compote , and cheesecakes are just some of the delights that feature these delicious amaranth-colored fruits. Their juicy flesh is also perfect for making cherry liqueur, an aromatic and elegant after-dinner drink made with seasonal cherries. Serve it after dinner alongside a rich and varied selection of homemade pastries like fruit baskets , cream puffs , or the timeless cannoli !
If you love homemade liqueurs, try these variations too:
To prepare the cherry liqueur, first wash and dry the cherries, then pit them using a cherry pitter . Pour the cherries into a glass jar, add the alcohol , close with the lid, and let them macerate at room temperature for one week.
After the maceration time has passed, retrieve the jar , strain the mixture through a sieve , and collect the infusion in a container. Pour the sugar into a small saucepan .
Add the water and heat the syrup over moderate heat for 15 minutes . Let the syrup cool slightly, then add it to the infusion .
Mix the obtained liqueur, transfer it into a jar with an airtight seal , and let it rest for 3 weeks at room temperature. After this time, your cherry liqueur will be ready: pour it into a bottle and store it at room temperature if it's not too hot, or place it in the refrigerator.
The cherry liqueur can be stored for 90 days in the refrigerator or at room temperature if it's not too hot. Once opened, it is preferable to store it in the refrigerator.
If you prefer a more aromatic touch, add vanilla seeds, cinnamon sticks, or orange peel to your liqueur.
