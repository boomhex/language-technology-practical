Among first courses with sausage we have made many over the years, yet we were missing something truly special! Thus was born sausage and beer pasta: an easy and quick recipe but above all rich in flavor. The tasty sausage sizzled in the pan receives a precious note from the beer: slightly sour and very aromatic. A first course that will really make you lick your whiskers.
If the sausage and beer pasta has won you over, then hold tight, we have the first courses that are perfect for you:
To prepare the sausage and beer pasta, start by putting the water on the stove to cook the pasta. Now cut the bacon into slices and then into cubes about 1 cm (0.39 inches) thick . Heat a pan over medium heat and add them to it .
When the fat becomes transparent , add the crumbled sausage without the casing . Brown it for about 5 minutes and deglaze with the beer .
As soon as the liquid has completely evaporated, pour in the cream and stir , letting everything flavor well over a very low flame. Salt and dump the pasta into the boiling water . When it is al dente, drain it into the pan with the sauce .
Add a splash of water if the sauce seems too dry, then season with chopped parsley, add pepper and salt if necessary. Mix and serve your sausage and beer pasta immediately .
It is recommended to consume the sausage and beer pasta immediately.
Add crushed walnuts or hazelnuts to the sausage and beer pasta sauce as you like.
If you want to replace the bacon, you can use cooked ham or omit it by increasing the amount of sausage a bit.
