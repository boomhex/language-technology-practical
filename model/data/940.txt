This is the kind of festive risotto that leaves a lasting impression—makes your holiday table feel complete. Pair it with a cold glass of bubbly, plus a slice of rustic bread, for a meal that checks all the boxes: comfort, celebration and a touch of Italian elegance—all in one.

To prepare the Champagne and Langoustine Risotto, start with the vegetables for the broth, coarsely chop the celery , carrot with the skin, tomatoes , and leeks.
Prepare the parsley mince that you will use to season the langoustine tartare. Now clean the langoustines, remove the shell , eliminate the gut, and chop half of the langoustines into tartare and the rest in half lengthwise .
At this point, heat a drizzle of oil in a saucepan with high sides and toast the vegetables for a few minutes over high heat, add the aromatic herbs the shells ,
the chopped tomatoes, and cover with cold water . The broth should simmer for at least 30 minutes over medium-low heat, after which you can strain it and keep it warm for cooking the rice.
Season the langoustine tartare with lemon zest , parsley, oil
salt, and pepper , mix and set aside to mix with the rice . In a pot where you will also cook the rice, heat a drizzle of oil very well and sauté the whole langoustines .
Sauté them for about 5 minutes without turning them . Remove the langoustines and in the same pan, start toasting the rice with a pinch of salt for about 3-4 minutes.
Moisten with the champagne , using it all at the beginning by pouring it twice and letting it absorb well. Continue cooking for about 15 minutes, moistening with the langoustine broth as needed. About 3 minutes before the end, add the sautéed langoustines , keeping a few aside to garnish the dish.
Off the heat, add the langoustine tartare , butter , and pepper, mix to combine. Serve the risotto garnishing the dish with the remaining sautéed langoustines and sprigs of oregano .
You can store the Champagne and Langoustine Risotto in an airtight container in the refrigerator for one day.
Money-saving tip without losing taste: champagne makes this risotto special, but due to the cost, you can replace it without much regret with a prosecco or white wine (make sure it's not sweet), which you can also pair with the dish, as tradition dictates.
