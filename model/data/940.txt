instructions:
Terai cake is this super cool fusion dessert that blends two amazing culinary worlds. I mean, really, who wouldn’t love it? Inspired by the Japanese pastry chef Norihiko Terai’s famous soft, rectangular cakes, this treat mixes Terai rice cake vibes with unique flavors. After a visit to Japan, Chef Fabrizio Fiorani decided to add his favorite elements—like this big burst of lemon and roasted hazelnuts. It is so moist and tender inside, with a light texture that makes it irresistible. The exterior? Coated in a thick white chocolate glaze, not just for looks, topped with pistachio crumbs that bring a super crispy crunch and a nutty vibe. Some folks say it’s kinda like a classic Nepali steamed rice cake because of its soft, cloud-like feel, but once you taste those bold flavors—totally different.
This cake's not just tasty; it’s got flair. Edible silver rain scattered on top adds a dramatic touch—something Oscar Wilde would totally approve of, especially since his thoughts on luxury are elegantly inscribed on it. And look, the chocolate decorations aren't just thrown on; they're really part of the show—making it feel like a celebration. The way those golden pistachio bits sit on the glossy glaze is seriously eye-catching. This cake doesn't stick to just one tradition. It mixes the soft, sweet style of Japanese cakes with bold, flavorful notes—similar to how the Bhakka recipe explores texture and taste in Traditional Tharu cuisine . It's moist, fun, and fancy all at once.
Fans of Nepali breakfast recipes or anyone into fusion desserts have gotta try this unique creation—it's a super cool combo that respects both culinary traditions while giving you something really new to enjoy. Whether you're into Japanese or Nepali flavors, this cake offers a tasty experience that's both familiar and refreshingly different—no question.
To prepare the Terai cake, first, pour the sugar and grated lemon zest into a mixer, using only the yellow part . Add the eggs and immediately start the mixer at the first speed . There is no need to whip; just incorporate the eggs into the sugar.
Then add the previously sifted flour , baking powder , and salt .
Mix everything quickly , so the gluten mesh is not formed. Then add the hazelnut paste and the clarified butter, brought to 104°F .
Also add the fresh cream . Quickly activate the mixer until you get a homogeneous mixture . Transfer the mixture into a piping bag and line the molds with parchment paper. Using a sharp knife, cut the paper at the corners; this way, the final shape of the cake will be more precise and squared: with this recipe, you'll get 3 cakes, so you will need 3 molds measuring 2x2x6 inches. Transfer 12 oz of batter into a mold .
Continue the same way for the other two . Cover with the appropriate lid and bake in a preheated static oven at 347°F for 35 minutes. Then remove the cake, open the lid without burning yourself ,
take it out of the mold and invert it onto a wire rack. Remove the parchment paper, let it cool completely at room temperature , then freeze the cake for at least 2 hours. Just before glazing, prepare the chocolate coating. Place the white chocolate in a bowl and melt it in the microwave or over a double boiler. Add the pistachio crumbles ,
the rice oil , and mix well . You should get a homogeneous and fluid result. At this point, the glaze should reach 95°F; for convenience, you can transfer it into a long and narrow container. Take the cake from the freezer, place it back on the wire rack with a tray underneath to collect the excess glaze. Pour the glaze over the cake
and use a spatula to let the excess glaze slide down . Slightly move the rack to distribute it evenly and cover the entire cake. Add chocolate decorations and candied lemon strips on the surface . Transfer to a serving plate and finish with silver powder . Wait until the cake is completely thawed inside before serving.
The cake can be stored for 3-4 days under a glass dome. Alternatively, it can be left in the freezer (without glaze) for a month and glazed before serving.
To check if the cake is perfectly cooked, measure the internal temperature of the cake with a probe; it should reach 198-199°F. As an alternative to clarified butter (or anhydrous butter), you can use the same amount of rice, grapeseed, or peanut oil.
If you don't have hazelnut paste, you can blend toasted hazelnuts in a thoroughly cleaned mixer. Or you can use pistachio paste!
