instructions:
To make the Carnival focaccia, first prepare the dough: crumble the fresh yeast in 220 g (7.75 oz) of warm water and stir with a teaspoon to dissolve completely, then pour the liquid into a large bowl. Add the semolina flour and start kneading with your hands, gradually pouring in the remaining water .
Add the all-purpose flour , salt , and oil , continuing to knead.
When all the ingredients are well combined , transfer the mixture to a work surface and continue kneading until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough, shaping it into a ball . Place the dough in a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rise for about 3 hours at room temperature.
Meanwhile, you can prepare the filling: cut the pork into cubes (10-11) and slice the onion thinly .
Heat the oil in a pan, add the onion , and let it turn golden for a few minutes, then add the meat and brown it over high heat for a couple of minutes, stirring often. At this point, add the canned tomatoes , salt, pepper, and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes: be careful not to overcook the meat to keep it tender.
When the filling is cooked, transfer it to a bowl using a slotted spoon to remove excess liquid and let it cool down . Finally, cut the mozzarella into irregular cubes and set aside; if it's quite watery, let it drain in a strainer until ready to use.
After the rising time, the dough will have doubled in volume . Transfer it to a lightly floured work surface and divide it into 2 equal parts . Roll out the 2 portions of dough with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 1/8 inch .
Grease a baking pan with a base diameter of 11.25 inches and a surface diameter of 12.75 inches , and line it with one of the dough portions, ensuring it adheres well to the base and sides . Add the meat and tomato filling ,
the mozzarella cubes , grated Pecorino , and ground black pepper .
Place the second dough portion over the filling to cover the entire pan and remove the excess dough with a knife . Seal the edges by pinching the lower dough with the upper one and folding it inward, creating a decorative pattern .
After sealing it, brush the focaccia's surface with oil using a brush and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 45 minutes. Once cooked, take it out of the oven and let it cool slightly, then your rich Carnival focaccia is ready to be served !
The Carnival focaccia can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 3 days. You can freeze it after cooking and cooling it completely.
If you wish, you can replace the canned tomatoes with fresh cherry tomatoes.
