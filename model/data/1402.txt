Ever wanted to dive into something really unique straight from Sicily's heart? The 'Mpanatigghi recipe is a real surprise. I mean, chocolate and beef tucked inside a sweet pastry shell—wow! From Modica, a charming town in southeastern Sicily, these half-moon shaped cookies, or Sicilian chocolate meat cookies , are a true testament to the island’s culinary inventiveness. Really, they are.
The outer shell is a tender shortcrust pastry traditionally made with lard. And the filling? It's got Modica chocolate , ground beef, almonds and a hint of aromatic spices. Sounds unusual, right? But that rich and slightly moist bite where chocolate and meat blend—seriously good. Legend has it nuns crafted this treat to sneak meat into their diet during Lent—pretty clever—disguising it as a sweet to maintain strength while fasting. The name hints at Spanish influence, kind of like empanadas, and perfectly shows off the island's knack for blending diverse cultural vibes.
Across Sicily, you’ll find variations, but Modica’s version is the most famous, celebrated for its use of local, intense chocolate. And here's the thing, this combo of sweet, savory, and slightly tangy spice is a rarity in Sicilian dessert recipes . Each bite offers a taste that’s both traditional and unexpectedly tasty—sparking conversations about the 'Mpanatigghi history almost as much as the flavors themselves. These cookies are a proof of Sicilian resourcefulness—turning simple ingredients into something uniquely delicious.
Pair them with coffee in the morning or as a perfect late-night snack when you're craving something rich yet not too heavy. Modica's pride in their traditional pastries is well-deserved. I gotta say, these cookies are a memorable treat that lingers long after the last bite. Anyone intrigued by Sicilian chocolate meat cookies or curious about Italian sweets with a twist will find themselves charmed by this blend of crispy pastry and its surprising filling. Give them a try—can't go wrong—and you'll discover why they're a beloved gem in Sicilian cuisine.
To make the 'mpanatigghi, start by preparing the dough: pour the flour and lard into a bowl and begin to work them with your hands to combine them, then add the yolk, the whole egg , and the sugar .
Knead with your hands until the eggs are completely absorbed , then add the baking ammonia and Marsala .
Also add the salt and knead everything to obtain a smooth and uniform mixture . Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour.
In the meantime, finely grate the Modica chocolate . Towards the end of the dough's resting time, prepare the filling: pour the minced beef and the grated chocolate into a bowl.
Add the sugar and the almond flour , and mix to combine the ingredients .
Also add the cinnamon and the clove powder and finish kneading by hand to obtain a homogeneous mixture .
After the dough's resting time, roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 1/16-1/8 inch ; to make it easier, you can divide the dough into two parts. Cut out circles with a fluted cutter with a diameter of 4 inches and place a tablespoon of filling in the center (about 0.7 oz) .
Slightly wet the edges with water and fold the circle in half to form a crescent, enclosing the filling inside . Transfer the cookies to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and press the edges with the tines of a fork to decorate and seal them further .
Make a small incision on the top of each cookie with a knife , then bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes. Once cooked, take out your 'mpanatigghi and let them cool slightly before enjoying them !
The 'mpanatigghi can be stored in a cool place for 1-2 days.
You can freeze them before baking if you used fresh, not thawed, ingredients; in this case, we recommend leaving them in the refrigerator for an hour before baking them.
If you wish, you can dust the 'mpanatigghi with powdered sugar before serving. Lard can be replaced with the same amount of butter.
