instructions:
To prepare the Neapolitan savory zeppole, first crumble the yeast into the sparkling water and stir to dissolve it completely . Pour the water and yeast mixture into a bowl where you have placed the flour .
Add the salt and incorporate it into the dough , then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes .
In the meantime, rinse the seaweed thoroughly under running water to remove the salt , then squeeze it out carefully and chop it with a knife .
After the rising time, add the chopped seaweed to the dough and incorporate it evenly . Cover again with plastic wrap and let rest for another 30 minutes.
At this point, heat the vegetable oil to a temperature of 340°F, then take portions of dough about the size of a walnut and let them slide into the hot oil with the help of 2 tablespoons . Fry a few pieces at a time for 3-4 minutes, or until golden brown. Drain the zeppole and transfer them to absorbent paper or paper towels . Salt to taste and serve your Neapolitan savory zeppole immediately !
It is recommended to consume the Neapolitan savory zeppole immediately.
The amount of water is about 150-200 ml: we recommend adding it gradually until you obtain a soft and elastic consistency, but not too liquid.
If you wish, you can replace half of the water with beer.
Squeeze the seaweed well to remove all excess water, if necessary you can dry them with a kitchen towel.
