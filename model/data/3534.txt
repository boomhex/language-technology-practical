Wash the potatoes, peel them , and slice them thinly with a mandoline (they should be 0.04 inches/0.06 inches thick). Grate the Gruyère and set aside. Heat the milk in a saucepan, when it is hot, add the halved garlic clove and nutmeg , season with salt and pepper.
Remove the flavored milk from the heat, discard the garlic clove, and let it cool. In the meantime, beat the eggs in a container and add the cream . Finally, add the mixture to the cooled milk and mix well. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. Butter a baking dish and start by placing a layer of potatoes .
Sprinkle them with a handful of grated Gruyère and finally soak everything with the liquid mixture of milk, eggs, and cream . Then add another layer of potatoes , more Gruyère, and cover again with liquid until all the ingredients are used. Compose the last layer with potatoes covered in grated Gruyère and a few pats of butter . Bake the gratin dauphinois at 350°F for about 90 minutes, until the potatoes are tender; the final result will be a soft gratin dauphinois on the inside and golden on the surface. Once removed from the oven, let it rest for a few minutes and serve your gratin dauphinois hot. Bon Appetit!!
If you don't have Gruyère, you can replace this strong-flavored French cheese with a mix of 2 cups of Parmesan and 1 cup of grated Emmental. If the gratin dauphinois becomes too dry and burns on the surface, cover it with a sheet of aluminum foil and continue baking.
