instructions:
To prepare the carrot, ginger, and clam risotto, first prepare the ginger oil by lightly heating two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil with 10 grams (0.35 oz) of cleaned and thinly sliced ginger. Let it sit for a day before straining it. Then, open the clams. Pour them into a pan (after they have been well purged) with a clove of garlic and a parsley stem without leaves , cover the pan with a lid until the clams open .
Then shell the clams, keeping some with the shell for the final decoration and strain their water. Finely chop the shallot, gently sauté it with a drizzle of ginger oil and add the carrots .
Toast the rice in a separate pot , and when it's ready, add it to the carrots , moistening everything as needed with the vegetable broth mixed with the clam water, salt, and pepper.
At halfway through cooking, add a pinch of grated ginger to the rice, and a few minutes before it's done, add the shelled clams , then salt, pepper, add a knob of butter and let it rest. Meanwhile, heat the clams with the shell that you set aside, also adding a few tablespoons of broth. Season with a pinch of chopped parsley and a bit of chives. Serve the carrot, ginger, and clam risotto hot, and decorate it by placing the clams with shells on top of the risotto.
If you do not want to use parsley in the preparation of the carrot, ginger, and clam risotto, fresh chervil can be used instead.
