instructions:
To make the gnocchi with asparagus cream, first prepare the Vegetable broth and keep it warm . Then take care of the sauce: clean the asparagus by removing the tough end of the stalk . Cut the tips and set them aside.
Cut the remaining stalk into pieces about 1 inch in length . Peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes . Clean and chop the onion .
Heat a generous drizzle of oil in a pot and lightly brown the onion , then add the asparagus stalks and the potato cubes .
Stir and let cook for 5 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally, add the strained broth , bring to a boil, lower the heat to the minimum, and cook for 15 minutes, adjusting salt and adding a pinch of pepper halfway through cooking. Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of oil in a pan , add the asparagus tips and sauté them for 2-3 minutes.
Then turn off the heat and set them aside. Meanwhile, the asparagus and potatoes will be cooked , blend everything with an immersion blender to obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream .
Transfer the asparagus cream to a large pan, also add 1/3 of the asparagus tips . Place a pot filled with water on the heat, bring it to a boil, add salt, and cook the fresh gnocchi . A few minutes will be enough, just the time for them to float. Drain them directly into the heated sauce .
Season with grated cheese , stir gently to mix , and serve the gnocchi with asparagus cream immediately, garnishing the plates with the remaining tips .
We recommend consuming the gnocchi with asparagus cream immediately.
You can prepare the asparagus cream in advance and store it in the fridge.
The potato gnocchi can be stored uncooked by leaving them on a cloth for up to a couple of hours at most; in this case, the cooking will be slightly longer because they will have dried in the air.
You can also freeze the gnocchi; in this case, place the tray in the freezer and after about 20 minutes, transfer the potato gnocchi into a food bag, and continue this way until all are frozen. Drop the frozen gnocchi directly into boiling water, being careful to cook a few at a time; otherwise, the water temperature will drop, and the gnocchi will dissolve.
We used seasonal asparagus with thin stalks; if your asparagus has a thicker and tougher stalk, we recommend removing the fibrous outer part with a vegetable peeler to make them softer. If you wish, you can prepare homemade Potato gnocchi following the procedure and dosages you find in our recipe. Store the gnocchi on a tray covered with a floured cloth while waiting to cook.
