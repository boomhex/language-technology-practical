instructions:
To prepare the vegetarian hosomaki, start by cooking the original rice. Rinse it under cold running water and boil it in salted water for 9 minutes. . Drain the rice and season it with rice vinegar, then let it cool to room temperature .
Cut the leek lengthwise with a knife and peel it . Prepare a steamer with a basket lined with parchment paper .
Place the leek leaves here and cook for 5 minutes with a lid . Once cooked , transfer them to a plate to cool.
Meanwhile, cut the pumpkin to obtain 4 rectangles 8 inches long and about 0.4 inches wide and high . Place the pumpkin rectangles in the same steamer and let them cook for 7 minutes .
Once cooked, let the pumpkin cool . At this point, place the seaweed on the special sushi mat and lay the rice on top, making sure to reach the edge of the short side and leaving about 0.4 inches of space from both long sides, flattening it well with your hands. In the center, spread a strip of wasabi with your finger .
Place 4 leek leaves over the entire surface of the rice and then place 2 pumpkin rectangles in the center . Now roll your hosomaki starting from the bottom, squeezing it well with your hands until the roll is well compact .
At this point transfer it to a cutting board and cut it first in half and then into 6 pieces . Your vegetarian hosomaki is ready to be served, if you like, with some soy sauce .
The vegetarian hosomaki keeps for a maximum of one day in the fridge. We do not recommend freezing it.
