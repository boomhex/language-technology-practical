Sfoglie alle olive is the kind of finger food italiano you just gotta try. Really, it's perfect for any chill get-together. You know, when you want that crunch mixed with something tender. This tasty snack comes from Northern Italy—where they seriously know how to turn simple ingredients into something really, really good. What's special is the puff pastry packed with olive flavor. Every bite gives you that crispy snap you crave in a good snack. And listen, alongside this, there's diced chicken breast coated in a classic Italian salsa verde . It’s bright and a little tangy—thanks to parsley, capers, and anchovies—waking up your taste buds in no time. This combo just nails what cucina italiana tradizionale is all about, pretty much. Turning basic stuff like pastry and chicken into something a bit fancy, yet still fun.
A lot of folks love serving sfoglie alle olive with insalata di pollo al verde as a simple antipasto sfizioso for guests. And here's the deal: the golden pastry and moist chicken?

To prepare the olive puff pastries with green chicken salad, start by placing in a pot with plenty of cold water 1 carrot, peeled and halved, 1 onion, peeled and halved, bay leaves, and cloves . When the water starts to boil, add the whole chicken breast and coarse salt, then cook for about 20 minutes . Drain the chicken and let it cool on a cutting board; in the meantime, prepare the green sauce : put basil, parsley, capers, olives, garlic, oil, and lemon juice in a mixer. Blend finely and adjust the salt. If the mixture is too thick, add 1 tablespoon of water.
Cut the cooled chicken breast into small cubes and dress them with the green sauce , mixing well to combine the ingredients. Finish by placing a spoonful of green chicken salad on each olive puff pastry.
