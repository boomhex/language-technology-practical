instructions:
Beat the egg and powdered sugar with a whisk, then add the milk , a pinch of salt, vanilla extract, and sifted flour .
The batter should be creamy and thick . Put about 1 1/4 inches of peanut oil in a low and wide pan and heat it to 356°F (try to keep the oil temperature rather constant); dip the pancake iron with the chosen shape screwed onto the handle (usually there are three different shapes available) and let it heat for a few seconds.
Remove the iron, let it drip, and place it on a sheet of kitchen paper for a second. Dip the iron into the batter but do not let the batter exceed the top edges of the mold. Immediately immerse the mold in the oil so that the batter remains a few millimeters below; wait a few seconds then gently shake the iron so that the batter, puffing up, detaches on its own . Proceed like this to form and fry 3-4 pancakes at a time, letting them brown on both sides .
Then let them drain on kitchen paper . Continue the same way until all the batter is used up (you will make about 45-50 pancakes), keeping in mind that you can also choose to change the shape and make pancakes of various designs. When all the pancakes are ready, dust them with vanilla powdered sugar , and... enjoy your meal!
