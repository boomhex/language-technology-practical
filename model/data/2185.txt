instructions:
To prepare the baked sardines, start by cleaning the fish (you can use disposable kitchen gloves): under running water, remove the head and, always with your hands, gently open the space between the head and the belly to remove the innards . Then, by opening the sardines like a book, you will be able to extract the central bone , pulling gently towards the tail.
Once all the sardines are cleaned , prepare the breading: pour the breadcrumbs, grated cheese , and crushed garlic clove into a bowl.
Rinse, dry, and finely chop the parsley ; then add it to the breading and further flavor with thyme leaves;
pour in the 2 oz of oil and mix everything until you get a uniform mixture .
At this point, take a baking dish measuring 7.5x6 inches and drizzle it with about 0.5 oz of oil. Arrange the sardines horizontally without overlapping them , salt (not excessively), pepper , and cover with half of the previously prepared mixture .
Arrange another layer of sardines, taking care to position them vertically (opposite to before), salt, pepper, and cover with the remaining breading over the entire surface .
Finish decorating the surface with pine nuts (19-20). Then bake the sardines in grill mode at 390°F for 8 minutes, until nicely golden. Once cooked, serve the baked sardines still hot .
Store baked sardines in the refrigerator for maximum of 1 day!
Freezing is not recommended.
Add the grated zest of a lemon to the breading or use crumbled stale bread instead of breadcrumbs!
