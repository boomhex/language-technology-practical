Mix together the Chorizo sausage, the white bread, which you have previously soaked in milk and squeezed, the egg yolks, and the grated Grana Padano PDO. Then add the pepper and a pinch of salt and mix everything well until the mixture is homogeneous and quite compact. At this point, lightly pound the scaloppine with a meat tenderizer and sprinkle each with the mixture you prepared earlier. Similarly, spread a tablespoon of mustard on the scaloppine, roll them up, and tie them with a piece of kitchen string. Melt the butter over medium heat in a skillet and cook the rolls for 15 minutes, turning them often so they cook evenly on all sides. Once the rolls are well browned, remove them from the pan and place them on a plate, and add the wine to the cooking juices in the pan. Over low heat, mix well until you get a fairly creamy sauce. Finally, add two tablespoons of water, return the rolls to the pan, and let them cook for another 10 minutes on low heat, remembering to turn them a few times to prevent them from sticking to the pan.
