To prepare the cups with candied chestnuts and meringues, start by cutting the candied chestnuts into small pieces and roughly crumbling the meringues with your hands ; if you prefer, you can make the meringues yourself by following the recipe on our site: French meringue (basic dough) . Set everything aside and prepare the Chantilly cream: whip the cream with 1/4 cup of powdered vanilla sugar (if desired, you can use less powdered sugar to obtain a less sweet cream since there are already candied chestnuts and meringues).
At this point, you can assemble the cups: place the Chantilly cream in a piping bag (alternatively, you can use a spoon), make a first layer with the candied chestnuts , then a layer of Chantilly cream , a layer of crumbled meringue , and then another of cream. Continue until the ingredients are used up. Finish with a layer of Chantilly cream garnished with some pieces of candied chestnut and meringue. You can prepare the cups in advance (even the night before) and store them in the refrigerator until it is time to serve them.
If desired, you can replace the candied chestnuts and meringues with dried figs and amaretti cookies!
