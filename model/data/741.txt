instructions:
To prepare the stuffed mozzarella with turnip greens, start with the greens. Remove the hardest part of the stem and wash them well . In a non-stick pan, pour a drizzle of oil, the garlic, and the chili pepper and sauté for a few minutes.
Add the turnip greens and let them wilt over medium heat for about 5 minutes . Add the salt, remove the garlic, and transfer to a small bowl , keeping the pan aside to toast the bread. Then take the chili pepper and slice it thinly.
Crumb the sliced bread into small pieces with your fingers and transfer it into the pan where you cooked the turnip greens . Toast it, turning it occasionally with a wooden spoon to prevent it from burning, and when it is well golden , turn off the heat.
Now, with the help of a small knife, cut the central part of the PDO mozzarella creating a cone-shaped hole . Extract the piece of mozzarella and cut it into small cubes .
Fill the PDO mozzarella with the turnip greens and mozzarella cubes . Transfer to a serving plate .
Finally, add the bread croutons and slices of chili pepper . The stuffed PDO mozzarella with turnip greens is ready to serve !
The stuffed mozzarella can be stored in the fridge for up to 1 day.
Instead of sliced bread, you can use roughly crumbled taralli.
To enrich the turnip greens, you can add oil-packed anchovies to the sauté.
