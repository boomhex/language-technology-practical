instructions:
To prepare the chops in orange sauce, first peel the orange alive: with the knife, trim the base and top cap , position them with the cut side resting on the cutting board so they will be stable. At this point, cut the peel with a sharp knife, being careful to also remove the white part which is bitter . Now extract the segments following the white line of the inner peel that separates them
Set aside 5 segments . Now cut the other orange in half and squeeze the juice . Take care of the meat: carefully flour the chops on one side
and on the other . Then place the butter in a large pan and melt it over moderate heat .
Add the chops and cook them for 3-4 minutes on one side, then turn them and continue cooking for another 3-4 minutes .
Now salt and deglaze the meat with white wine , let it evaporate, and then also pour in the orange juice and the segments. Continue cooking for another 6 minutes on each side. Once cooked, serve the chops in orange sauce immediately .
The chops can be stored in the fridge for a maximum of one day. Freezing is not recommended.
Cooking times may vary based on the size of the chops. For a more aromatic touch, you can scent the chops with fresh thyme leaves at the end of cooking.
