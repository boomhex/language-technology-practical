To prepare the saffron penne in foil, thinly slice the bacon , then let it brown in a non-stick pot until it's nice and crispy .
Transfer it to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper so it releases the excess fat . Place a pan over the heat and pour in the cream along with the saffron . Stir with a kitchen spatula, then add the crispy bacon .
Let it all blend for 5 minutes, then turn off the heat . Bring salted water to a boil, which you'll need for cooking the pasta, then add the penne , cooking them for 8 minutes until al dente. Drain the pasta .
and add it directly to the sauce you've prepared , mixing everything with the spatula for 2-3 minutes with the heat off . Season with salt
and pepper to taste , then add the grated cheese , distributing it evenly .
Cut 4 parchment paper sheets and put a portion of pasta on each one , then fold the upper ends and close like a parcel .
Once finished , place the parcels on a baking sheet side by side and put them in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 3-4 minutes. When they're ready, take them out and serve your saffron penne in foil .
Store the saffron penne in foil in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days.
To simplify (and reduce the time of "foiling"), you could enclose the penne in a single piece of parchment paper, which, brought to the table and opened while steaming and fragrant, will certainly surprise your guests.
