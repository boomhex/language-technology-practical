Add the orange juice and blend with the whisk , then pour in the hot milk gradually, straining it through a sieve .
You should obtain a homogeneous mixture . At this point, return it to the saucepan and let it thicken over medium-low heat, stirring continuously .
Once the cream has thickened, turn off the heat and flavor with Cointreau . Stir well to blend it homogeneously. Transfer the cream to a bowl and let it cool completely . Your cream for panettone is ready to be enjoyed !
The cream for panettone can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days in an airtight container.
It cannot be frozen.
By adding Cointreau while the cream is still warm, the alcohol tends to evaporate, and only the aroma will be noticeable. If you prefer to taste the alcoholic note, you can add it after the cream has cooled down.
Alternatively, you can omit the Cointreau and use only the orange juice.
