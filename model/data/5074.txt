Apple jam is a preserve that captures the flavor and sweetness of one of the most beloved and versatile fruits. Making it means transforming apples into a velvety and fragrant cream, which you can enjoy for a long time. You will need only three ingredients: apples, sugar, and lemon, to achieve an incredible result. During cooking, the apples begin to release their natural juice, blending perfectly with the sugar to form a thick and sweet base. The lemon zest and peel not only balance the sweetness but also give the jam a lively and citrusy note that refreshes the palate. Stored in airtight jars, this jam maintains its golden color and velvety texture for months, allowing you to savor the fruits of autumn even in the months of the rest of the year. Whether for breakfast, a snack, or to add a special touch to your desserts, apple jam will soon become an essential element in your pantry!

To prepare the apple jam, first peel them and cut them into quarters, then remove the central part with the seeds and finally cut them into chunks .
Transfer the apples to a pot, then add the sugar , the zest , and the juice of one lemon .
Stir everything and cook for 35-40 minutes, stirring often to prevent the sugar from sticking to the bottom of the pot. When the apples have become soft, blend with an immersion blender . Transfer the jam to previously sterilized airtight jars, then turn them upside down and let them cool completely. Your apple jam is ready to be enjoyed !
Apple jam can be stored in sterilized and tightly sealed glass jars for about 6 months in a cool, dark place. Before using, always check that the jar has maintained the vacuum seal. Once opened, it should be kept in the refrigerator and consumed within 1-2 weeks.
If not placed in sterilized and airtight jars, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4-5 days.
For a fresher and slightly spicy touch, you can add grated ginger!
The home preparation of preserves and jams can present health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the necessary conditions and measures to guarantee the safety and suitability of food, which, on the contrary, industrial procedures are able to ensure in order to prevent dangerous contamination. It is therefore important to scrupulously follow food safety instructions to reduce risks, but one must always bear in mind that one can never achieve the same food safety as professionally produced preserves and jams. For the correct preparation of home-made preserves, we refer to the Italian Ministry of Health guidelines
