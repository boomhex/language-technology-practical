In the world of Piedmontese cuisine , this appetizing recipe shows why Italian rabbit dishes never go out of style—a solid favorite for good reason!
Fill a large pot with water; cut off the rabbit's head and remove the entrails ; prepare the vegetables, stud the onion with cloves and immerse the vegetables in the water ,
bring slowly to a boil and add a tablespoon of coarse salt and the bouquet garni (rosemary-thyme-myrtle-1 sprig of sage) tied with kitchen string; when the vegetable broth is hot, also immerse the whole rabbit and cook for at least 60 minutes or until the meat is very tender. After this time, remove the rabbit and transfer it to a very large bowl and pour its own boiling cooking broth over it until covered; let it cool completely in its broth.
Remove the rabbit and let it drain in a colander ; now you will need to debone and finely shred the meat ; gently wash the sage and peel the garlic cloves ;
chop the garlic (you can also leave it in half cloves if you prefer to remove it later), take sterilized jars with vacuum seal lids (or a clay or glass terrine like those for quick consumption), pour a generous amount of high-quality oil on the bottom, a little chopped garlic
a few sage leaves and some of the shredded rabbit , then again oil, garlic, sage, and rabbit until you finish the meat . Finally, pour a little more oil on the surface. Seal the jars hermetically and sterilize them by placing them in a large pot, completely covering them with cold water, and setting them on the heat to bring to a boil; boil the jars for 45-60 minutes; let them cool in the water. This way the jars create a vacuum seal.
If you wish to consume rabbit tuna in the short term, it is advisable to use a clay or glass terrine (like pyrex) with a lid for hermetic closure, proceed as with the jars layering and consume the day after preparation to allow all the flavors to blend.
