To prepare the citrus salmon with pilaf rice, start by marinating the salmon: get a citrus juicer and squeeze the juice of 5 blonde oranges and 2 untreated Sorrento lemons (1-2). Strain the juices with a sieve into a large baking dish with high sides , to remove seeds and pulp pieces.
Immerse the deboned salmon fillets in the juice inside the baking dish , grate a pinch of peeled fresh ginger , and add the zest of 2 oranges .
Grate the zest of one lemon as well , then cover the baking dish with plastic wrap and let it marinate in the refrigerator for about 2 hours . In the meantime, prepare the pilaf rice without adding spices, as the salmon and its cooking sauce will already be very flavorful. Boil 17 oz of water in a pot and add a tablespoon of coarse salt .
In a non-stick pan, put a tablespoon of oil, add the rice , and toast it for a couple of minutes while stirring. When the water in the pot reaches boiling, turn off the heat and pour the boiling water into the saucepan where you toasted the rice, the water should cover the rice by at least an inch . At this point, cover the pan with a lid and cook on low heat for about 10-12 minutes, then turn off the heat and let it rest.

Now clean and trim the fresh spring onions, slice them thinly , and heat the butter in a non-stick pan over low heat . Once the butter is melted, transfer the sliced onions into the pan and cook over moderate heat for 5-6 minutes.
Then add acacia honey and, after the salmon fillets have marinated, transfer them to the pan, keeping the marinade juice aside, and place them with the skin side down in the pan . Cook for 5 minutes over moderate heat, then turn them over to the flesh side and cook for 2 minutes .
Turn the salmon fillets back to the skin side , increase the heat, and deglaze everything with a glass of the marinade juice . Salt to taste and cook for 1 minute so that the citrus juice creates a delicate sauce. When the salmon is ready, place it on a serving dish and accompany it with pilaf rice. For a more pleasing aesthetic, spoon the pilaf rice, which will have cooled slightly, into a round mold or a small bowl, then invert it onto a serving plate, creating a dome shape. Then make a bed of salad and place a salmon fillet on top, accompanied by the citrus sauce : your citrus salmon with pilaf rice is ready to be enjoyed!
Store the citrus salmon with pilaf rice in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container, for up to 1 day. Briefly heat it in the microwave before consuming. Freezing is not recommended.
If you want a less acidic sauce, you can increase the amount of honey. You can also replace fresh spring onions with leeks and not strain the citrus marinade juice to get a thicker and more flavorful sauce. If you don't like salmon, you can also make this recipe with swordfish or tuna fillets!
