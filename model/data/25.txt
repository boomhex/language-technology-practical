instructions:
To prepare the eggs with ’nduja, first slice the onion thinly . Then slice the pepper into rings and chop the chili pepper into pieces .
Prepare a sauté with a drizzle of oil, a clove of garlic, the onion, the pepper, and the chili pepper . Let everything flavor well for about 5 minutes, then remove the garlic and chili pepper . Add the peeled tomatoes, crushing them by hand . Adjust the salt and let cook for about 15 minutes.
Add the 'nduja and mix until it is well melted into the sauce . Pour in the eggs one at a time, for convenience break them into a small bowl first, so it will be easier to pour them into the pan .
Proceed quickly until all 4 eggs are added . Cover with a lid and cook for about 5 minutes. The egg white should be cooked, while the yolk remains soft. Serve the eggs hot, adding a pinch of salt to each .
The eggs with ’nduja can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
If you don't like 'nduja, you can omit it. If you're worried about getting a result that's too spicy, reduce the amount of chili pepper.
