Caffè all’arancia con aria di latte is one of those unique treats—straight from Italy—that puts a fresh spin on classic espresso. Seriously good stuff. This orange coffee recipe is really something else. You get the deep, rich flavor of Italian moka pot coffee mixed with sweet orange syrup, which is great. It's an aromatic and tangy delight that feels both traditional and fresh. The orange syrup? Total game-changer. It gives the coffee a subtle sweet lift, just like those Sicilian desserts that use citrus to brighten things up.
And you know what? Across Italy, locals might toss in their own regional oranges, so sometimes you get more zest or a little extra syrup. The thick layer of creamy milk foam on top adds a moist, fluffy feel—making every sip something special.
Plus, a final dusting of cinnamon powder and some orange zest pieces make this aromatic coffee drink not only taste good but look seriously impressive—like something you’d snag at a trendy café. Friends and family are always thrilled when you serve up this kind of orange-infused espresso . Perfect for dessert or a lazy afternoon treat.
The way the creamy milk foam sits on top and holds the cinnamon? It adds a cozy, almost golden finish to the whole experience. Honestly, it's a great example of how Italians take simple things—like coffee and milk—and transform them into something a bit gourmet with just a few touches.
If you’re into homemade coffee beverages or want to wow folks with some flavored latte recipes , this drink is a fantastic choice. The mix of tender milk froth, citrus zing, and rich espresso makes this one of those citrus coffee creations that feels fancy but is super approachable. Really really impressive. You get that gourmet coffee vibe at home without much fuss, and it makes any coffee break feel extra special. For sure, whether for a gathering or a quiet moment, this blend of flavors is sure to make your coffee time memorable.
To make orange coffee with milk foam, start by preparing the orange syrup: with the help of a peeler or a sharp knife, remove the orange peel and cut it into julienne strips . Blanch the peel in boiling water 3 times, changing the water each time .
Drain the orange peel well and set it aside . In the meantime, put a saucepan over the heat with 140 ml of water, add the sugar , let it dissolve well, and bring to a boil (you will need to cook everything on low heat, stirring often to avoid burning the sugar). When it reaches a boil, add the peel to the syrup and continue cooking for 5 minutes . At the end of the indicated time, turn off the heat, transfer the syrup with the peel to a bowl, and let it cool until it reaches room temperature.
Now prepare the coffee using a coffee maker. To obtain excellent coffee, fill the boiler of your coffee maker with cold water, preferably low in calcium, being careful not to exceed the safety valve (otherwise, you will get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee, forming a little mound , which you will level by tapping the filter on the table with firm movements . Do not press with a spoon, nor make holes on the surface.
Screw the coffee maker tightly (to prevent coffee from leaking from the sides while rising), then place it on a low and steady flame, to obtain a rich coffee. As the coffee rises, a thick froth will form ; we recommend not letting it bubble for too long, to keep its aroma and sweetness intact. Your coffee is ready: before pouring it, stir it directly in the moka with a spoon to make it more homogeneous .
In a tall and narrow container, pour the milk , strictly cold, and froth it using an immersion blender, working only on the surface . In four medium glass cups, pour 20 ml of orange syrup for each, adding a few pieces of peel .
Pour the hot coffee (about 1.4 oz or 40 ml) into the syrup of each glass and complete by placing 2-3 tablespoons of cold milk foam on top . Finally, decorate the orange coffee with milk foam with a light sprinkle of ground cinnamon and enjoy it immediately.
We recommend consuming the orange coffee with milk foam immediately.
To froth the milk well, it is essential that it is cold. When working with the immersion blender, it is important to stay close to the surface to obtain a creamier foam. For a better result, we recommend preparing the orange syrup the day before. The syrup can be stored, closed in an airtight container, for up to a week.
