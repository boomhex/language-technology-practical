instructions:
To make the mushroom and potato savory pie, first boil the potatoes for 30-40 minutes or until tender. Prick them with a fork to test for doneness. Cut the scamorza cheese into approximately 3/4-inch cubes . Now, focus on cleaning the mushrooms: cut off the base of the stem where it's most earthy .
Remove soil residues with a brush or cloth , then slice the larger ones, such as the champignons , the pleurotus (or king oyster mushrooms)
and the portobello . You can keep the chanterelles whole. Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan with the garlic clove cut in half and the core removed . Add the mushrooms and cook over high heat for 5 minutes.
Lower the heat, salt, and continue cooking for 10 minutes over medium heat . At the end of cooking, remove the garlic, season with thyme leaves , and set aside .
Meanwhile, when the potatoes are cooked, peel them while still hot , place them in a bowl and mash them with a fork . Add the fresh cream ,
the eggs and 1/2 cup of grated cheese . Salt, pepper, and mix to combine all ingredients .
Incorporate the mushrooms and mix again . Grease a 9-inch baking dish with oil .
Now, lay the puff pastry over the dish , making sure to adhere it well to the bottom and edges. Prick the base with a fork . Pour in the filling .
Level the surface with the back of a spoon . Distribute the scamorza cubes and the remaining 1/4 cup of grated cheese over the surface.
Seal the puff pastry by folding the edge and brush the edge with milk . Bake in a preheated convection oven at 392°F for 30 minutes. Once baking is complete, unmold the mushroom and potato savory pie and let it cool slightly before serving .
The mushroom and potato savory pie can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. You can freeze it after it has been baked and completely cooled.
If you have a potato ricer, you can use it to mash the potatoes while they're still hot; there's no need to peel them since the skin will remain inside the tool.
