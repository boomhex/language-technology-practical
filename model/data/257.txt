instructions:
To prepare beetroot culurgiones with potatoes and blue cheese sauce, first, boil the potatoes starting with cold water; it will take about 30-40 minutes, depending on their size . Meanwhile, prepare the dough: peel the pre-cooked beetroots and place them in a beaker along with the water .
Blend with an immersion blender to obtain a smooth and homogeneous puree . Place the semolina on the work surface in a mound, then pour the beetroot puree into the center and add a pinch of salt .
Start incorporating the flour by mixing with a fork , then continue with a dough scraper , and finally knead the mixture by hand .
Once you have obtained a smooth, elastic, and homogeneous dough , wrap it in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to rest for at least 30 minutes. In the meantime, the potatoes will be cooked, so mash them in a bowl . Cut the mint leaves into very thin strips .
Add the mint to the mashed potatoes along with a pinch of salt and the grated pecorino cheese . Mix well to combine the mixture and set aside.
Take the dough and divide it in half , making sure to wrap the portion you are not using in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out. Slightly flatten the dough with your hands and start rolling it out with a pasta machine, beginning with the largest thickness . Fold the sheet towards the center and roll it out several times, gradually reducing the thickness.
Once you have obtained a sheet with a thickness of approximately 1/16 inch , cut out discs with a 4-inch diameter cookie cutter . You can re-knead the scraps and roll them out again after a brief rest. Place a ball of filling in the center of each disc .
Fold the disc in half and pinch the edges starting from one end to the other, sealing the filling inside ; it's normal for a little filling to poke out at the end. As you form the culurgiones, place them on the work surface lightly dusted with semolina and set them aside for a moment.
Finally, focus on the fondue: in a saucepan, combine the Roquefort cheese and milk , then turn on the heat to its lowest setting and stir with a whisk until the cheese is completely melted .
You are ready for cooking: bring a pot of salted water to a boil, gently immerse the culurgiones , and cook for 3-4 minutes. When they float to the surface, drain them and transfer them to a non-stick pan, then add a drizzle of olive oil and a ladle of cooking water . Briefly toss everything to finish off, and you're ready to plate.
Spread the Roquefort sauce on the base of the plate , then place the culurgiones and garnish with mint leaves. Your beetroot culurgiones with potatoes and blue cheese sauce are ready!
It is recommended to consume the beetroot culurgiones with potatoes and blue cheese sauce immediately.
You can store the raw culurgiones in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Alternatively, you can freeze them and then cook them directly from frozen, extending the cooking time by a few minutes.
If you prefer, you can replace the Roquefort with Gorgonzola, either sweet or spicy.
When sealing the culurgiones, you can spray the edges with a little water to make them adhere better.
