instructions:
To prepare the soft cake with yogurt and fruit, start with the batter. In a large bowl, pour the eggs and sugar , then beat them with an electric mixer until they become white and frothy .
At this point, sift the cornstarch inside and add the whole wheat flour . Mix with a spatula from bottom to top, without deflating the mixture .
Finally, incorporate the chocolate chips , then pour the mixture into a greased and floured 9-inch pan . Bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for about 20 minutes. When the cake is cooked, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly .
Then remove it from the mold and let it cool completely upside down on a wire rack . Meanwhile, whip the cream with powdered sugar. Then pour the yogurt into a bowl , add the whipped cream and mix from bottom to top until you get a smooth cream and transfer it to the fridge.
Only when the cake is completely cold can you transfer the freshly prepared cream onto the surface . Decorate with berries , mint leaves , and serve your cake!
The soft cake with yogurt and berries can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can replace the berries with other fruits, such as grapes, apples, pineapple, or kiwi.
