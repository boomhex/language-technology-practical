instructions:
To prepare risotto with onion cream and hazelnuts, first prepare the Vegetable broth and keep it warm. Clean and slice the red onions . In a hot pot, add the diced butter . Once melted, add the onions .
Add the sage leaves , season with salt and pepper, and cook covered for 15 minutes on medium-low heat, stirring occasionally .
The onions should be soft and dry . Deglaze with white wine vinegar and let it evaporate, then transfer the onions to a jug .
Blend with an immersion blender until smooth and velvety . Strain the cream through a sieve to make it more homogeneous. Move on to cooking the rice: heat a dash of oil in a saucepan .
Add the rice and season with salt . Once the rice is well toasted and hot, deglaze with white wine and let it evaporate.
Cook for 10 minutes, adding the broth little by little; always ensure the liquid is boiling and that the previous amount has been absorbed . Meanwhile, fry the sage leaves briefly in hot seed oil at 340°F , just long enough to make them crispy, then drain them .
Place them on a tray lined with paper towels to absorb the oil and set aside. After 10 minutes of cooking the rice, add the onion cream to the saucepan and continue cooking for another 2 minutes. Turn off the heat .
Cream with grated Parmigiano Reggiano, cold butter , and oil . Finally, add pepper to taste .
Stir vigorously, then let it rest for a minute . Plate the risotto, garnishing with toasted and coarsely chopped hazelnuts and the fried sage leaves. The risotto with onion cream and hazelnuts is ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the risotto with onions and hazelnuts immediately.
You can prepare the onion cream in advance and store it in the fridge for up to 2 days.
For optimal results, choose high-quality Carnaroli rice and Piedmont hazelnuts.
