instructions:
To prepare tonnarelli alla gricia with cod, first remove the skin from the already desalted cod and any bones, then cut the flesh into cubes . Remove the rind from the guanciale and cut it into strips .
Place the guanciale in a hot pan without adding any fats and brown over medium-high heat, stirring often . When the guanciale is crispy and golden, transfer it to a bowl, leaving the cooking fat in the pan .
Meanwhile, bring a pot of unsalted water to a boil and cook the tonnarelli until al dente . In the meantime, add the cod to the pan where you cooked the guanciale and sauté it for a couple of minutes, deglazing with white wine .
Drain the tonnarelli into the pan with the cod , add a ladle of cooking water , pepper , and mix everything over high heat.
At this point, turn off the heat and add almost all the crispy guanciale and almost all the grated pecorino cheese . Add the cheese little by little and mix the sauce well until a creamy consistency is obtained , adding a little more cooking water if necessary.
Plate the tonnarelli as seasoned and finish with the reserved guanciale and pecorino . A final grind of pepper and your tonnarelli alla gricia with cod are ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the tonnarelli alla gricia with cod immediately. If necessary, you can store them in the refrigerator for one day in an airtight container.
If you wish, you can use fresh tonnarelli!
