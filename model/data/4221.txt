instructions:
Troccoli are rustic tagliolini of fresh pasta with a rough grain typical of Puglia, also known as spaghetti alla chitarra, which are very well suited for preparations with sauces and gravies, preferably fish-based; they are generally homemade using a special ridged rolling pin (troccolaturo) that, when passed over a not-too-thin sheet, cuts it into tiny strips with an oval cross-section. Those who do not live in those areas will not easily find the ridged rolling pin useful for making troccoli in their city; it will be much simpler to buy ready-made troccoli in fresh pasta shops or supermarkets.
For the preparation of troccoli in pink sauce with Pachino cherry tomatoes and prawns, start by cleaning the prawns: remove their shell (carapace) and chop half of them . Then clean the spring onions (or shallots) by removing the tougher outer layer; slice them thinly and sauté them for a few minutes in oil over medium heat .
As soon as the spring onions are softened, add the Pachino cherry tomatoes that you have cut into 4 wedges and sauté them over high heat for a few moments, without fully cooking them to prevent them from becoming mushy. Then add the chopped prawns and the whole prawns to the Pachino cherry tomatoes , stirring carefully so as not to break them too much. Now add the white wine and let it evaporate , then salt.
Finally, add the chopped chives (or parsley) , the cream and complete the cooking by thickening the sauce a bit, which should not become too dry; now add the troccoli that you have boiled in plenty of salted water, tossing everything for a few moments ; adjust with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
Troccoli are often found in the refrigerated sections of supermarkets, as they are sold as fresh pasta, but sometimes you can also find them among dried pastas; if you really can't find troccoli, you can substitute them, with equally satisfying results, with vermicelli or spaghetti alla chitarra.
