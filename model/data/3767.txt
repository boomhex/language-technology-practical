To prepare the sausage in a blanket, start by dividing the leavened dough into 4 equal parts (1.75 oz each) , then roll it out with a rolling pin to form a rectangle that can completely wrap the sausage, which you will shape better with a small knife .
Place the sausage in the center of the rectangle of dough and wrap it completely like a candy (5-6).
Remove the excess dough from the sides and, with a sharp knife blade, make crosswise cuts on the surface of the dough . Repeat this process for all 4 sausages . Preheat the oven to 390°F, then line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the 4 sausages in a blanket; bake for about 10 minutes, then serve while still hot.
If you want to make the bread dough yourself, you can do so by following our recipe, which you can find by clicking Bread dough . To make the sausages in a blanket even more delicious, you can wrap a slice of cheese around the sausage before covering them with the bread dough!
