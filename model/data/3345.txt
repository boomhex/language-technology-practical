They love this quick mix of oregano-spiked tomato sauce and real mozzarella. You can taste that simple goodness in every bite. It's the kind of Caprese flatbread that shows up at family gatherings or when friends drop by, and you know what? Nobody can stop at just one piece. The smell of basil and oregano really ties it all together, making the room feel warm and welcoming.
In different towns across Tuscany, you'll find all sorts of little twists, but the main idea's the same: an easy flatbread pizza that's packed with that moist, cheesy pull and a sauce that reminds you of summer.

These flatbreads are perfect for sharing because they're easy to grab and eat. And look, they go great with a chilled drink or as part of a spread with olives and cured meats. What's cool is how quick this Italian flatbread recipe is—nothing fussy or fancy, just honest, tasty food. Perfect, really, anytime you want something that feels special but not over-the-top. So, whether you call it homemade flatbread pizza or a quick Margherita flatbread , it's one of those things that gives you that soft, cheesy center and a burst of herby, tomato goodness in every bite. For real. Perfect for when you need a little taste of Italy without much fuss. Whether for a casual dinner or a festive gathering, these flatbreads really really hit the spot, bringing that authentic Tuscan charm to your table. Which is great.
To prepare the tomato and mozzarella flatbreads, start by preheating the oven to 392°F, then place the tomato sauce in a bowl, add the oregano, salt, and two tablespoons of olive oil, mix well and set aside. Cut the mozzarella (or provolone) into small cubes , take the baking sheet and line it with parchment paper, lay the flatbreads on top, pour a tablespoon of sauce on each appetizer and top with a few pieces of mozzarella. Bake for about 5 minutes, just enough time to melt the mozzarella. Once cooked, remove the flatbreads, garnish with basil leaves, and serve them hot.
