Schiacciate con cozze, bottarga e scorza di limone is a standout Italian seafood flatbread from the beautiful Tuscan coast. And listen, this dish is all about the fresh, intense flavors of mussels enhanced by the salty, almost tender quality of bottarga . In Tuscany, they really know how to make these seafood flavors pop, with a splash of zesty lemon zest—finely sliced to add a burst of tangy brightness that’s as appealing visually as it is to your taste buds. Really good stuff.
Each bite of the thin, crispy flatbread (known as schiacciata) offers a really really good mix of sea flavors, a hint of salt, and just the right amount of crunch to keep things exciting. Perfect for any aperitivo. And you know what? It’s great for casual get-togethers, giving your guests a taste of something different and refined.
Plus, you’ll often find people using either mullet or tuna bottarga for this dish, and both options work wonders—the rich flavor of the fish roe complements the moist, sautéed mussels and the super fragrant lemon. This combination is what makes mussel and bottarga flatbread a favorite among Italian appetizers. The presentation of this snack also grabs attention; the thin strips of lemon zest on top add a golden touch, reminiscent of a dish you might find at a seaside trattoria.
Whether you're a fan of traditional Italian recipes or just looking to try a Mediterranean seafood dish that’s easy to share, this is a solid choice. Even those who aren’t typically into seafood often appreciate how the flavors blend, especially when the zesty lemon cuts through the richer bites. Schiacciate con cozze, bottarga e scorza di limone is perfect for impressing guests while keeping the atmosphere relaxed and enjoyable. And here's the thing, this dish really captures the core of Tuscany’s coastal culinary magic, making it a must-try for anyone looking to explore authentic Italian flavors.
To prepare the flatbreads with mussels, bottarga, and lemon zest, start by cleaning the mussels: you can also consult the Cooking School How to Clean and Open Mussels . Wash them thoroughly under running water, remove the beard , that is, the tuft that protrudes from the shell, and scrub the latter with a scouring pad or scrape with the blade of a small knife. Finely chop the peeled garlic clove and brown it in a large pan with a drizzle of oil; if you prefer, you can also add some fresh chili.
Pour the mussels into the pan , stir and cover with a lid to open the shells: this will take about 5 minutes. While the mussels are cooking, remove the yellow part of the untreated lemon peel using a knife and cut it into very thin strips. When the mussels have opened, drain and shell them .
You can thus compose your flatbreads by placing 2-3 mussels on each flatbread ; then proceed by grating some mullet bottarga or tuna and decorating with a few strips of lemon peel . Your flatbreads with mussels, bottarga, and lemon zest are ready to be enjoyed!
The flatbreads with mussels, bottarga, and lemon zest are excellent if consumed fresh. They can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day, in an airtight container. Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer, you can add some chili along with the garlic in the pan to open the mussels and deglaze with some white wine. You can also make the flatbreads with a mix of mussels and clams.
