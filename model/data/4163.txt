To prepare the oven-baked crispy chicken, start by cleaning the chicken breast, removing any cartilage and small bones . First, cut into fillets , then slightly angle the knife to create slices .
In a bowl, place the oat flakes and breadcrumbs , then mix. Add the chili powder and paprika .
Mix again to achieve an even coating. In another bowl, crack the eggs, add a pinch of salt , and beat with a fork .
Dip the chicken first in the egg and then in the breadcrumb mixture . Line a baking tray with parchment paper and brush it with 1 tsp of oil. Arrange the chicken pieces on the tray and drizzle with the remaining 1 tsp of oil .
Bake in a static oven at 350°F for 20 minutes, turning the chicken halfway through cooking . Once golden , your crispy chicken is ready to serve !
It's best to consume the oven-baked crispy chicken immediately; if needed, you can store it in the fridge in a sealed container for up to 2 days. Reheat in the oven at 350°F for about 10 minutes before serving.
You can customize the coating as you prefer: for a gluten-free version, replace the breadcrumbs with cornmeal or rice flour, while for a more rustic flavor, you can use chopped nuts like almonds or hazelnuts.
To make the oven-baked crispy chicken even lighter, you can replace the egg with Greek yogurt or mustard to help the coating adhere.
