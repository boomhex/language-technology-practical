To prepare the cantucci with Grana Padano and nuts, start by pouring flour, grated Grana Padano PDO , oil , and egg whites into a bowl.
Mix well with your hands and knead until you get a smooth dough. Add the nuts, almonds , and pistachios .
First mix in the bowl , then transfer everything to a work surface and shape it into a loaf about 1.5 inches wide . Flatten the loaf slightly
and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Bake in a static oven preheated to 350°F for about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and cut the loaf into slices about 0.2 inches thick to create the cantucci . With these amounts, you'll get about 24.
Place the cookies back on the baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a static oven preheated this time to 340°F for about 25 minutes, until they are well golden brown . Then take out your Grana Padano and dried fruit cantucci and let them cool, then enjoy them .
You can store the cantucci with Grana Padano and nuts for 3-4 days in a tin container or under a glass dome.
You can freeze the loaf before baking. Then thaw in the fridge and bake as indicated.
If the dough turns out too dry, slightly increase the amount of egg whites.
