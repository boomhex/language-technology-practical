instructions:
To prepare flour tortillas , pour the warm water and oil in a bowl and emulsify with a whisk , then add the salt .
Mix to dissolve the salt completely . Pour the flour in a separate bowl and gradually add the liquid , kneading with your hands .
Transfer the dough on a pastry board and continue kneading until you get a smooth and homogeneous texture. It will take about 5 minutes . Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes .
After the resting time, divide the dough into 5 portions of 3 oz (80 g) each . With a rolling pin, roll out each piece on a lightly floured pastry board until it forms a very thin disc with a diameter of at least 7 inches (18 cm) . As you roll out the discs, take care to keep the rest of the dough wrapped in cling film to keep it from drying out.
While rolling out the dough, heat a cast iron pan (or non-stick, alternatively). Once hot, place the first tortilla inside and cook for about 1.5 minutes on one side and 1.5 minutes on the other . As they are ready, cover the tortillas with a cloth to prevent them from drying out. Your flour tortillas are ready to serve as you like !
It is advisable to eat flour tortillas immediately otherwise they will dry out.
If you prefer, you can prepare the dough in advance and store it in the refrigerator wrapped in plastic wrap.
You can freeze the dough or the cooked tortillas: in this case, defrost them in the refrigerator and heat them in a pan.
Seed oil can be replaced with the same dose of olive oil. To get a slightly softer texture, you can use the same amount of butter or lard.
If you have difficulty rolling out the dough, let it rest a bit longer at room temperature.
