To prepare the summer vegetable soup, cut the zucchini into cylindrical pieces, peel them, and cut them in half lengthwise . Remove the inner pulp of the zucchini with a spoon , cut the zucchini into slices about 1/2 inch thick, they should not be too thin otherwise they will fall apart during cooking.
Peel the potatoes and cut them into wedges ; do the same with the onions, after peeling them, cut them into wedges ; now take care of the tomatoes: cut the tomatoes in half, remove the seeds with a spoon
and then cut them into wedges too . Remove any strings from the celery ribs with a vegetable peeler , then cut them into pieces about 3/4 inch long;
Now that all the vegetables are ready , place a large pot on the stove, add the cut vegetables: the potatoes , the zucchini ,
the celery , the tomatoes , the onions .
Add the whole garlic clove and the basil leaves to flavor the soup, pour in a tablespoon of olive oil , add salt, and finally cover the vegetables with water .
Cover the pot with a lid and cook for 30 minutes over low heat (after which check that all the vegetables are well cooked). It's very important not to stir the vegetables with a ladle to avoid breaking them; if necessary, gently shake the pot. After about 20 minutes of cooking, check the condition of the vegetables; adjust the salt and add hot water if needed, keeping in mind that at the end of cooking the cooking liquid should be partially absorbed by the vegetables. At the end of cooking, add the remaining oil, pepper, remove the whole garlic with kitchen tongs , and let cool to room temperature. Serve the summer vegetable soup at room temperature or cold from the refrigerator, adding a drizzle of raw olive oil and fresh basil leaves.
You can store the summer vegetable soup in an airtight container, in the refrigerator, for 2-3 days maximum. If you used fresh vegetables, you can freeze the soup once cooked.
If you couldn't find long white zucchini, you can replace them with green zucchini, and you can also enrich the soup with other vegetables of your choice such as green beans, peas, or carrots.
