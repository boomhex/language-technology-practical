If you want to savor a taste of Emilia-Romagna on a plate, then schiacciate con crema di squacquerone e culatello is the way to go. Really, it’s all about those flavors. This Italian flatbread recipe brings together schiacciate, which are these little rustic breads with a great crispy texture. You know the kind. They’re layered with a creamy spread of squacquerone cheese . Squacquerone is a regional gem, known for being super moist and a bit tangy, almost melting as it touches the warm bread. So so good.
Then, you add slices of culatello ham —a local cured meat famous for being tender and slightly sweet, offering a different flavor than other hams you might have tried. Honestly, the blend of the cheese and culatello is what really sets this dish apart. It’s a must-try for anyone who appreciates true Italian antipasto. This combination is a staple at gatherings throughout Emilia. People love it, especially when they want something that’s easy to enjoy and bursting with local flavor.
You'll find variations as you explore the region—sometimes a thicker schiacciata is used, or a sprinkle of black pepper is added. Pretty much depends on taste. Thing is, it’s all about highlighting those classic Emilia-Romagna ingredients in a straightforward way. And listen, folks love serving this as a traditional Italian appetizer at family gatherings or when friends pop in for a quick snack. It’s perfect as a finger food, making it ideal if you’re into easy Italian recipes that require minimal fuss. And you know what? The golden hue of the bread paired with the white cheese and deep pink slices of culatello make for a visually appealing dish.
Just grab one and relish that mix of creamy cheese, rich ham, and bread that’s still a bit warm. This is what makes it an authentic Italian flatbread —it's about letting quality ingredients shine without overcomplicating things. So, when you crave a taste of Emilia-Romagna that’s straightforward yet incredibly tasty, these little bites are sure to satisfy. Whether you're hosting a gathering or simply enjoying a quiet evening at home, this dish captures the core of Italian culinary tradition with every bite. Can’t go wrong with that.
To assemble the flatbreads with culatello and squacquerone cream, start by preparing the squacquerone cream with green pepper: put the squacquerone, fresh cream, and two tablespoons of oil in a blender. Blend until all the ingredients are well combined into a smooth and homogeneous cream. Crush the green pepper and add it to the squacquerone cream, then adjust with salt and mix well . Fill a piping bag with a serrated tip with the squacquerone cream with green pepper and cover the flatbreads. Cut the culatello in half and place it on the flatbreads, finally finish by drizzling a few drops of Modena balsamic vinegar glaze on each snack.
