The spinach and taleggio risotto should be consumed as soon as it is ready, but if there are leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for up to 1 day.
If you don't like taleggio or don't have it available, you can replace it with something lighter like ricotta or robiola.
A handful of toasted walnuts or almonds will give a crunchy note that pairs well with the creaminess of the dish.
For a heartier version, you can add crispy bacon cubes, speck, or smoked salmon.
