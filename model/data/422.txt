instructions:
To make the syrniki, place the cheese in a bowl and mash it with a spatula , then add the egg yolk and sugar .
Stir to combine everything . When the mixture turns yellow, add a pinch of salt and the flour gradually , stirring to incorporate it evenly.
Dust the work surface with a little flour, then take a quarter of the mixture and flatten it slightly on the palm of your hand . Place a cube of dark chocolate in the center and shape the mixture into a ball .
Place the ball on the work surface, lightly flour the top, and gently flatten it , then use a glass to achieve a round shape . Arrange the syrniki on a tray lightly dusted with flour and place them in the freezer for an hour.
Meanwhile, prepare the berry sauce: pour the blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries into a saucepan , then add a little water and cover with a lid .
Turn on the medium-low heat, then add the grated lemon zest and sugar . Cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally .
After this time, strain the berry sauce and let it cool . You can proceed to cooking: grease a non-stick pan with vegetable oil and heat it well.
Place the syrniki , cover with the lid , and cook for about 3 minutes, turning them on both sides .
Serve the syrniki with fresh blueberries and berry sauce , dusting with powdered sugar to taste !
Cooked syrniki can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days, in an airtight container.
You can store raw syrniki in the freezer for up to 3-4 days and then cook them directly from frozen.
If you can't find tvorog, you can use quark or ricotta, making sure to drain the excess liquid first.
Add the flour gradually, adjusting the quantity based on the consistency of the mixture.
The freezer step is necessary to firm up the syrniki, but if you're in a hurry, you can skip it and cook them directly.
