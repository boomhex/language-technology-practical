So next time you're in the mood for a little treat, give these coffee delights a try—they'll bring a touch of Italy right to your table. Which is great.
To prepare the coffee cream kisses, start by placing the eggs and sugar in a stand mixer (or a large bowl) . Beat the ingredients with a whisk until you get a light and frothy cream . Then, in a bowl, mix the sifted flour and baking powder .
Then remove the whisk and gradually add the flour and baking powder to the cream , mixing with a spatula to combine everything. Take a piping bag with a simple nozzle and pour the cream inside, using the spatula to help .
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and start distributing the cream with the piping bag to create dough disks about 1 inch in diameter , trying to space them a few inches apart . Bake in a preheated static oven at 374°F for at least 12 minutes (or 338°F if using a convection oven for about 6 minutes) or until the disks have slightly puffed and just start to brown at the edges. Then remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies cool .
While the cookies cool, start preparing the cream to fill them: in a large bowl, place the eggs and sugar and mix with a hand whisk or an electric mixer until you get a light and frothy cream. Then add the flour and continue to mix the ingredients well.
Set the obtained cream aside; meanwhile, pour the milk into a large saucepan. Turn on low heat and warm it up, adding the coffee powder and stirring to dissolve it . Bring it just to a boil, then turn off the heat . Then pour the milk and coffee mixture into the cream you set aside and mix with the whisk to combine everything. Then transfer this mixture into the same saucepan where you warmed the milk, straining it with a sieve . Stir and turn on the heat to thicken the cream. Then turn it off and set aside.
Then prepare the coffee to add to the cream: place cold water, preferably low in calcium, inside the boiler up to the safety valve (otherwise you will get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee and level with each added teaspoon of coffee by tapping the filter on the table with firm movements , until reaching the edge of the filter.
Do not press with the spoon, nor create holes, and screw the coffee maker tight (to avoid coffee leaking from the sides as it rises), then place it on a low and steady flame to obtain a robust coffee. As the coffee rises, a dense foam will form ; we recommend not letting the coffee bubble too long to preserve its aroma and sweetness. Then turn off the heat, and your coffee to use in the preparation is ready: stir it directly in the moka pot with a teaspoon to make it more homogeneous .
Now, soak the gelatin in cold water for 10 minutes . After the necessary time, squeeze it and add it to the freshly made coffee to dissolve, stirring with a teaspoon (23-24).
At this point, take back the saucepan with the coffee cream that you thickened over low heat by stirring with the whisk and gradually add the coffee with the dissolved gelatin . Stir with the whisk, and if the cream seems too liquid, put the saucepan back on low heat to thicken while continuing to stir with the whisk .
When the coffee cream is ready, turn off the heat and transfer it to a glass container. Cover it with plastic wrap touching the cream and let it cool for about an hour in the refrigerator. After the necessary time, fill a piping bag with a star nozzle with the now cold coffee cream , using a spatula or spoon to help. Then take the now-cooled cookies and start filling half of them with the coffee cream .
Now place the remaining cookies on each filled half to create your kisses . Then transfer them to a wire rack and finish them with melted chocolate, creating small decorative lines on each kiss using a paper cone . To make a paper cone, you can consult the cooking school sheet: how to make a cone with parchment paper. If desired, you can whip some fresh liquid cream with powdered sugar and fill your kisses with whipped cream, in addition to the coffee cream, to make them even softer and tastier !
You can store coffee cream kisses in the refrigerator for a maximum of 2 days to prevent them from becoming too soft. Freezing is not recommended.
