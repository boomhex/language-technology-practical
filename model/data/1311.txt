instructions:
To prepare the water glaze, first pour the powdered sugar into a bowl . Then add 2 tablespoons of water and mix the mixture with a whisk ,
until you obtain a smooth consistency. This way you'll get a rather thick glaze , perfect for decorating cookies. At this point, add a little water-soluble dye with your preferred color and stir until you obtain a uniform color . If the color intensity is not as desired, you can add a little more dye.
Transfer the glaze into a parchment paper cone and use it to decorate your cookies . If you want to achieve a more fluid glaze perfect for pouring over a dessert like a cake or a pound cake, add another tablespoon of water before adding the dye.
Mix again with a whisk . You will get the perfect consistency for glazing a pound cake or a cake! To do this, just place the dessert on a wire rack and pour the glaze over it . If you prefer, you can leave the glaze natural, without adding dyes!
Water glaze can be stored in the refrigerator covered with a damp cloth for up to 1 day.
To flavor your glaze, you can use orange or lemon juice instead of water. Try making Homemade powdered sugar with our recipe!
