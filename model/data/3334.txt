Sfinci di San Giuseppe come from Palermo, a beautiful city in Sicily. These sweet treats really steal the show during Italian festivals, especially on March 19th, St. Joseph’s Day. Locals? They absolutely love them, and they quickly become the highlight at family gatherings. And you know what? What makes the Sfinci di San Giuseppe recipe stand out is the soft, spongy inside achieved through a slow, careful fry—sometimes up to fifteen minutes. The word "sfinci" means "sponge," which is just perfect because their texture is so airy and light. After they get that golden finish, they’re topped with sweet ricotta cream, chocolate chips, chopped pistachios, and colorful candied orange peels and cherries. This combo gives you a bite that’s moist and creamy inside, with a bit of crunch and fruity tang on top—super tasty.
Across Italy, people celebrate St. Joseph’s Day with special sweets, like "raviole" in Emilia. But in Palermo? St. Joseph’s Day pastries almost always mean these delicious Sicilian cream puffs. Each one looks like it's ready to party—like a little celebration on a plate. Sicilian cream puffs are rich, but not too heavy. That ricotta filling? Perfectly sweet without being overwhelming. Plus, the pistachios and candied fruit add that classic Sicilian flair. So crunchy and chewy with every bite.
These pastries are the kind of food that pulls everyone to the table, especially for celebrations. And, frankly, while Sfinci di San Giuseppe taste best fresh, they're really good even after sitting for a bit, keeping their tender, cloud-like feel. If you want to experience traditional Sicilian desserts , there’s nothing quite like these ricotta-filled delights to mark a special day with loved ones. Whether you're actually in Sicily or just dreaming about it, these treats offer a true taste of Italian festivity. Pretty simple, right? And the flavors? Seriously good.
Start preparing the Sfinci di San Giuseppe by making the ricotta cream. The night before, put the sheep's ricotta in a colander to drain well, then pour it into a bowl and add the powdered sugar: mix to combine everything, cover with cling film or a lid, and let it rest in the refrigerator overnight. Pour the water, butter (or lard), and salt into a saucepan , and once it comes to a boil, add the flour all at once , stirring the ingredients on the fire with a wooden spoon for at least 2-3 minutes .
until the mixture detaches from the saucepan . Let it cool , and in the meantime, you can add the dark chocolate chips to the ricotta cream and put it back in the refrigerator until the Sfinci are fried.
Place the dough in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment (or work by hand with a wooden spoon) and process the dough for 1 minute, then add the eggs one at a time: do not add the next egg until the previous one is fully absorbed. You should obtain a smooth, creamy, and thick batter . Melt the lard (or heat the oil) in a saucepan until it reaches 320-329°F, then fry the dough by spooning it into the saucepan : do not fry more than 3-4 Sfinci at a time to avoid lowering the oil temperature too much and to ensure enough space when the Sfinci start to grow.
Turn the Sfinci often using two forks , to brown them on all sides and let them inflate well . At this temperature, the Sfinci need to fry for at least 10-15 minutes. When they are well golden, drain them well with a slotted spoon and lay them on a tray lined with paper towels.
When you have finished frying, let the Sfinci cool slightly, then take the ricotta cream, work it a few seconds with a wooden spoon, and then, using a spoon, cover the surface of the Sfinci . Garnish each Sfincio with some pistachio granules , a candied cherry, and a piece of candied orange peel . Serve immediately.
As an alternative to butter, 60 grams of lard can be used for the dough.
