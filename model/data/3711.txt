instructions:
To prepare the light parsley omelette, first crack the eggs, separating the yolks from the whites . Beat the yolks in a bowl with a fork, then add the grated cheese , the sifted flour ,
the milk , salt and pepper, and beat again with the fork to mix the ingredients well and obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Wash, dry, and finely chop the parsley and set it aside. Beat the egg whites until stiff with a pinch of salt using an electric mixer (7-8), then gently fold in the chopped parsley .
Always very gently, fold the yolk mixture into the egg whites and mix with a spatula from the bottom upwards, to avoid deflating the egg whites . Heat the olive oil in a pan, then pour in the final mixture .
Let it cook over low heat for a few minutes, covering the omelette with a lid ; flip the omelette to the other side with the help of the lid , and finish cooking. Serve your light parsley omelette hot !
The light parsley omelette can be stored covered with plastic wrap for 2-3 days in the fridge.
If desired, you can use chives instead of parsley, or a mix of herbs such as parsley, chives, thyme, basil, or other aromas you like!
