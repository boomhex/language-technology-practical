instructions:
To prepare the fried rice, first grease a plate and divide the rice into 4 equal parts (if you don't know how to prepare yellow rice, see how to do it Saffron risotto ), then take one portion and flatten it with the back of a spoon to form a thin disk. Heat a pan with a diameter of 9.5 inches and place a tablespoon of clarified butter in the center of it (if you don't know how to make it, see how to obtain it Clarified butter ); transfer the rice disk to the pan using a thin, long spatula which you will slide under the rice to detach it from the plate. If the disk breaks during this operation, don't worry: reassemble it in the pan with the back of the spoon.
Fry the rice over moderate heat for at least 5 minutes (the rice should become reddish), then place a lid (or a plate) on top of the pan and flip everything upside down. Let the rice disk slide from the lid back into the pan and then fry it for another 5 minutes on the other side, until it becomes golden brown. As you prepare each fried rice disk, place them on a plate and keep them warm in the oven at 140°F. Once all 4 disks are ready, serve them sprinkled with a tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese.
