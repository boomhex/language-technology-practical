instructions:
To prepare crepe lasagna with vegetables, first, cut the tops into pieces ; then cut the prepped celery and carrot into strips .
In a pan, add a drizzle of oil, put in the carrots , add the celery , and season with salt and pepper . Sauté over high heat for 5 minutes .
Add the broccoli , cover with a lid , lower the heat, and cook for 15 minutes . Add water if needed.
Meanwhile, blanch the spinach in salted boiling water , blanch just for 2-3 minutes and drain them using a slotted spoon , then transfer them to a bowl with ice water ; this way, you will stop the cooking and preserve the color of the spinach.
Squeeze the spinach well and transfer them to a blender; pour in the milk , adjust the salt , and blend until you get a smooth and homogeneous sauce.
In a bowl, beat the eggs, add the flour , and mix to obtain a smooth and homogeneous batter, gradually add the milk , and finally the spinach cream .
Mix to thoroughly combine all the ingredients and obtain a homogeneous mixture , then add a drizzle of oil and mix again .
Grease a pan, heat it, and pour in a ladle of batter ; when the crepe is cooked , on both sides, set it to cool on a plate . With these quantities, you should obtain 10 crepes.
Meanwhile, prepare the béchamel sauce. Heat the milk in a saucepan . In another pot, melt the butter, add the salt , pepper, and nutmeg .
Add the flour and cook for 2 minutes, stirring continuously. Pour the hot milk into the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until the béchamel sauce thickens .
It’s time to assemble the lasagna. Put a couple of tablespoons of béchamel sauce on the bottom of a baking dish , place two spinach crepes on top , and continue with another layer of béchamel sauce .
Place plenty of vegetables on the béchamel sauce, then add a sprinkle of Parmesan . Continue in this way until you finish the ingredients. Sprinkle the surface of the lasagna with Parmesan . Bake in a fan oven at 350°F for 20 minutes. If you want a delicious crust on the surface, move the baking dish to the top of the oven and bake in grill mode for another two minutes, making sure not to burn them. Remove them from the oven and let them rest for 5 minutes. The crepe lasagna with vegetables is ready, all that’s left is to plate and serve .
It is best to consume the crepe lasagna with vegetables immediately; if there are leftovers, they can be stored for 2-3 days in the fridge in a closed container. They can also be frozen, perhaps already portioned, so you always have them ready when needed.
The beauty of this recipe also lies in its versatility. You can customize it according to your tastes and preferences, adding or replacing the vegetables with seasonal ones, or varying the composition of the béchamel sauce to create new flavor combinations.
