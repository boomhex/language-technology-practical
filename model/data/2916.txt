To make cavatelli with pumpkin and bacon, start by preparing the pumpkin: clean the pumpkin by removing the seeds, peel it, and cut it into slices , then dice it into cubes about 1/2 inch . Take a baking sheet, line it with parchment paper, and place the pumpkin cubes inside. Season the pumpkin with oil, salt, pepper
and flavor with the sprig of thyme and bay leaf . Bake the pumpkin cubes in a preheated static oven for 20 minutes at 392°F (in a fan oven at 356°F for 15 minutes). Once the pumpkin has softened, remove it from the oven and set it aside . Meanwhile, take care of the cavatelli: place a high-edged pot on the stove, pour in the water, add salt, and bring to a boil. Cook the cavatelli for 7-8 minutes if using fresh pasta; if using dried pasta, you will need to increase the cooking time by a couple of minutes. You can also make fresh pasta yourself by following our Cavatelli recipe.
While the pasta is cooking, place a large pan on the stove, drizzle with a little olive oil, and add the sweet bacon cubes . Sauté the bacon for a few minutes until it turns pink, then add the baked pumpkin cubes to the pan , mix everything for a moment, and as soon as the pasta is al dente, drain it and add it to the sauce. Sauté the pasta with the pumpkin and bacon for a few minutes, just enough time to let it absorb the flavors. At this point, your cavatelli with pumpkin and bacon are ready to be served hot !
Enjoy cavatelli with pumpkin and bacon immediately. If you have leftover pasta, you can store it in the refrigerator for one day in an airtight container. Freezing of the finished dish is not recommended, but you can freeze the cooked pumpkin cubes.
To flavor the pumpkin cubes, you can use other aromatic herbs like rosemary or sage. As an alternative to sweet bacon, you can use smoked bacon cubes for a stronger flavor.
