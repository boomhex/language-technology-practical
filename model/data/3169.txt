instructions:
To make the pandoro and Nutella® cannoli, cut 8 slices each 0.4 inches thick from half of a leftover pandoro (taking care to remove the top crust) . Press them lightly with a rolling pin to make them 0.2 inches thick (2-3).
Melt the butter in a small pan and toast the slices on both sides until golden .
As you toast the slices, roll them while still warm around a cannoli tube with a diameter of about 0.4 inches , pressing the ends together gently . Place the cannoli in the refrigerator to firm up for 15 minutes .
Meanwhile, prepare the cream: in a bowl, pour the mascarpone and fresh cream , and whisk with an electric mixer until you get a fluffy mixture .
Transfer the cream into a piping bag with a star nozzle . Take the cannoli, gently remove them from the tube and fill them first with the mascarpone cream by squeezing it from one side
and then with Nutella®, also squeezing with the help of a piping bag, from the other side . Once you have filled all the cannoli, place them on a work surface, lay strips of paper over them , and dust them with powdered sugar to achieve a striped pattern. The pandoro and Nutella® cannoli is ready to be enjoyed !
We recommend consuming the cannoli immediately.
If you don't have traditional cannoli tubes, you can create similar molds by rolling a sheet of aluminum foil about 4.7 inches wide until reaching a diameter of 0.4 inches.
