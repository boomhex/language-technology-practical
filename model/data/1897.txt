instructions:
To prepare the fried tofu, first cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes . Transfer the cubes to a baking dish and add the soy sauce , a few sprigs of rosemary
and a few sage leaves , then cover with plastic wrap and let marinate while you continue with the rest of the recipe. Now prepare the breading: pour the breadcrumbs into another container, season it with a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of chopped rosemary and mix well.
Finally, prepare the batter: pour the flour into another bowl, add the salt and the water and mix everything well .
At this point you can proceed with frying: heat the seed oil to a temperature of 340°F, then take the tofu cubes from the marinade with kitchen tongs , dip them in the batter and let the excess drain on a rack , then coat them evenly with the breading .
Fry a few pieces at a time using a slotted spoon ; when they are well golden (it will take about a minute), remove the cubes from the oil and transfer them to a sheet of paper towel . Serve the fried tofu while still hot, perhaps on a bed of lettuce and radishes !
It is recommended to consume the fried tofu immediately or store it in the refrigerator for a maximum of one day. Freezing is not recommended.
As an alternative to the lettuce, you can accompany the fried tofu with a simple yogurt and mint sauce or with delicious Guacamole !
