Peel the onions and slice them thinly , chop the hazelnuts without skins and the pine nuts . Then heat the oil in a large pan
Add the onion to the pan and let it wilt over low heat . When the onions are wilted and transparent, add the chopped hazelnuts and then the pine nuts to the pan (5-6) and sauté everything over high heat for a few minutes.
Pour hot water over the ingredients , add the very finely chopped parsley , salt, and pepper and let it cook for another 5 minutes. At this point, to bind and thicken the sauce, add a little sifted flour (1 or 2 tablespoons) , mix well and serve it to accompany the fried fish.
Cousbareia sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days in an airtight container.
