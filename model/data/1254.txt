instructions:
To prepare the dark chocolate namelaka, first chop the chocolate and transfer it to a tall and narrow container. Soak the gelatin in cold water . In a small pot, pour the milk and add the glucose .
If you have a vanilla bean already scraped of seeds, add it to the milk and bring everything to a boil. Remove any remaining vanilla bean and pour half of the milk into the chocolate .
Blend with an immersion blender for a few seconds , then drain the gelatin and melt it in the remaining hot milk . Add the milk and gelatin mixture to the chocolate and blend again with the immersion blender for a few seconds.
At this point, add the fresh liquid cream and blend again until you obtain a smooth and fluid cream, then pour it into a bowl .
Cover with plastic wrap and let it crystallize in the refrigerator for 12 hours. After this time, take the namelaka out of the refrigerator : it will be firm and creamy, perfect for filling a dessert. Alternatively, work it with electric beaters for a few minutes : this way it will become airy and whipped, perfect for decorating many desserts!
You can store the dark chocolate namelaka in the refrigerator for 3 days, covered with plastic wrap in contact. Adding spices of your choice to infuse in the milk.
Instead of the vanilla bean, you can flavor the namelaka with orange zest, rum, cinnamon, or other spices to leave in infusion in the milk!
Glucose can be bought in well-stocked supermarkets. If you cannot find it, try substituting it with honey.
