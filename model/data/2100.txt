instructions:
To prepare the acquasale, first wash all the vegetables; then focus on the celery. Use a peeler to remove the outer strings and then split it in half lengthwise with a knife . Finally, cut it into strips about 1/4 inch thick .
Move on to the onion, cutting it into strips of the same thickness and set it aside. Take the cherry tomatoes and cut them into quarters, then cut each quarter in half to make 8 pieces from each cherry tomato. Lastly, work on the white cucumbers; there's no need to peel them; first, cut them in half lengthwise
and then into half-moons about 1/4 inch thick . Now that all the vegetables are cut, take a rather large deep dish, where you must first pour the water and then the oil .
Add a pinch of salt and emulsify everything with a whisk . Then add the cherry tomatoes ,
the cucumbers , the onion , and finally the celery .
Mix everything with a spoon , place the friselle around the dish , and serve the acquasale !
You can store the acquasale for up to 1 day in the fridge, without adding the friselle.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you need to prepare the acquasale in advance, it is advisable to cut all the vegetables and season them at the time of serving.
White cucumbers, also known as "cummarazzi," are typical of Puglia and are more digestible, but if you can't find them, don't worry, regular cucumbers will do just fine. In that case, it's advisable to peel them before cutting!
