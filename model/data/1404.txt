instructions:
To prepare the Celebration Cake, add sugar, rice , milk , vanilla seeds, and the emptied vanilla bean into a pot. Finally, add the grated lemon zest .
Stir and cook over medium heat for an hour, stirring occasionally, until the rice is cooked and the milk has significantly reduced . At this point, transfer to a wide and shallow baking dish, remove the vanilla bean
and cover with plastic wrap on contact . Let it cool first at room temperature, then in the refrigerator for 12 hours or overnight. After this time, transfer the rice mixture to a bowl, add the cream
and whole eggs . Stir with a whisk , then add the egg yolks
and stir again. Add the previously ground almonds , diced candied citron
and crumbled amaretti . Mix again and pour the mixture into a greased 14 x 11 inch, 1.2-inch high pan . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 60 minutes on the lower rack. Meanwhile, prepare the syrup: pour water and sugar into a small pot and bring to a boil.
Add the liquor and let it simmer for another 3 minutes . As soon as the cake is cooked, remove it from the oven .
At this point, brush the hot cake with the syrup just prepared to soak it evenly . Cut the Celebration Cake into squares before serving !
The Celebration Cake can be stored at room temperature for 2 days, covered with a dome.
Instead of citron, you can use candied orange.
If you do not want to use amaretto, you can use orange juice or almond flavoring.
