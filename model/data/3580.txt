instructions:
To prepare the kofta (Middle Eastern meatballs), finely chop the mint leaves , then cut the chili pepper in half lengthwise, remove the seeds with the tip of a knife, and mince it . Place the lamb meat in a bowl along with the chopped mint and chili pepper .
Add the thyme leaves , and the cumin ; grate the zest of half a lemon ,
crush the garlic and mix vigorously with your hands to combine all the ingredients well . Season with salt and pepper ,
then add the ras el hanout and mix everything again . Shape into elongated meatballs, each about 3 oz with the mixture you prepared ,
then insert them into the skewers : with our quantities, you should get 8 pieces. Once finished , preheat the grill, then cook the meat for 2 minutes per side ,
turning it for even cooking . After the required time has passed , turn off the heat and serve the kofta hot .
You can store the kofta in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days. If you have used only fresh ingredients, you can also freeze them in the same way after they have completely cooled.
To further enrich the flavor of the kofta, in addition to mint, you can also chop some parsley or fresh coriander: these spices will give an even more Middle Eastern touch to the already very fragrant preparation.
