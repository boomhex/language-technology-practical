instructions:
To prepare the chicken bombs with cheese and pepper, start by grating the Pecorino . Now coarsely crush the taralli with a meat tenderizer to break them into crumbs and set them aside .
Take a slice of chicken, season with salt and pepper on both sides . Stuff the center with about 0.18 oz of Pecorino and a sprinkle of oregano .
Fold the sides inward and wrap the slice to create the roll . With these quantities, you will make 12. Roll the rolls in the crumbled taralli .
Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, sprinkle with pepper and drizzle with oil . Bake in a preheated ventilated oven at 392°F for about 20 minutes, turning the bombs halfway through cooking. While the bombs are in the oven, prepare the sauce: in a small saucepan, toast some pre-ground black pepper for a few minutes, once toasted, pour in the water and turn off the heat .
Pour the grated Pecorino into a jug and add the now lukewarm water , blend with an immersion mixer to obtain a smooth sauce .
Once the chicken bombs with cheese and pepper are cooked , remove them from the oven and serve them hot with the Pecorino sauce .
We recommend consuming the cheese and pepper bombs immediately. If any are left over, store them in the fridge for a maximum of a couple of days.
You can use breadcrumbs scented with spices like paprika, or even chopped herbs like rosemary, oregano, and sage in place of taralli.
For perfect cooking, use very thin slices or possibly thin them with a meat tenderizer.
