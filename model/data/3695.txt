instructions:
Start with marinating the rack. In a zip-lock food bag found at any supermarket, place the meat, then add the apple juice , lime juice , and hand-torn mint leaves .
Add the mignonette (coarse-crushed black and white peppercorns) , crushed coriander seeds , peeled and crushed garlic, and salt. Once everything is in the bag, seal the zip and shake vigorously to achieve a slight emulsion . Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Preheat the barbecue to maximum temperature. Meanwhile, cut the heads of endive lengthwise and the onions into rings. Corn cobs should be grilled whole and then cut off the cob afterward. Once the vegetables are ready, melt a tablespoon of butter to brush onto the vegetables . Grill the vegetables at high heat for a few seconds to maintain structure while adding grill marks for flavor .
Meanwhile, prepare parsley oil by finely chopping a bunch of parsley, including the stems, and placing it in a mortar with oil . Crush the ingredients with a pinch of coarse salt. Finally, strain without pressing to keep the oil clear.
When it's time to cook the meat, remove it from the marinade and pat dry with a paper towel . Lightly brush with vegetable oil and grill at high heat . Remember that the apple juice sugars absorbed by the meat will caramelize quickly , potentially burning.
Once the surface is well-seared, remove from heat and wrap the meat in a triple layer of aluminum foil, then place it back on the barbecue away from direct heat. If you have a lid for your barbecue, keep it closed. Cook for the recommended time, remove from heat, and leave the meat wrapped to rest for at least 10 minutes to allow juices to redistribute. Take the meat out of the foil , slice the chops , and plate three per guest with the grilled vegetables and previously cut corn. Drizzle with parsley oil and some of the cooking juices collected from the foil. Sprinkle with mineral salt (black, red, or coarse salt) and serve hot.
