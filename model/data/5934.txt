instructions:
To prepare fluffy pancakes , separate the yolks from the whites and place the latter in a bowl . Beat the whites with a whisk until frothy. Add the yogurt and beat some more with the whisk.
Add the oat flour , the agave syrup and the baking powder .
Stir just enough to obtain a homogeneous mixture . Grease a deep pan roughly 5" in diameter with seed (or coconut) oil and heat on the stove. Add the batter .

Cover with a lid and cook for around 10 minutes on a low flame, then delicately turn it over using a spatula or a fork, and finish cooking on the other side for another 10 minutes.  Place the fluffy pancake on a serving dish .

Garnish with wild berries , agave syrup and ground pistachios . Serve immediately .

Fluffy pancake is best enjoyed freshly made. If any is leftover, store in the refrigerator for 1-2 days a most.
Thoroughly crease the pan so that the batter does not stick to the sides. Oat flour can be replaced with rice flour, and greek yogurt with plant-based yogurt. The leftover yolks can be used to make an omelette, or to prepare a pastry cream.
