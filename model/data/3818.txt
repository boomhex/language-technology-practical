To make chocolate kipferl, chop the dark chocolate place the almonds in the mixer with half of the sugar and chop them not too finely to create the classic granules ,
In a bowl, sift the flour, incorporate the remaining half of the granulated sugar add the almond granules . Then add the cold butter in pieces and the chopped chocolate .
Flavor with the grated lemon peel and also add the egg and a pinch of salt .
Knead the ingredients quickly by hand until you obtain a homogeneous and compact dough , form a loaf, wrap it with cling film and let it harden in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
After the resting time, take the dough and divide it into pieces of about 0.5 oz each , roll the pieces to create sticks about 1/5 inch thick and 4 inches long , fold the sticks to create crescents , with these doses you will obtain about 50 cookies.
Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and let them harden for another 30 minutes in the refrigerator. After the resting time, bake the kipferl in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 20 minutes (or ventilated oven at 300°F for 15 minutes). Once baking is complete, remove the cookies from the oven , let them cool on a rack. Meanwhile, place the chopped chocolate in a bain-marie ,
heat over moderate heat until completely melted . Once the cookies have cooled, dip the tips in the chocolate and then place them on a rack to let the chocolate dry .
Store the chocolate kipferl in a tin box for 3-4 days
Only for die-hard gourmands, who shudder at the word "diet": after dipping the ends of the cookies in melted chocolate, why not sprinkle them with sugar crystals or chopped hazelnuts?
