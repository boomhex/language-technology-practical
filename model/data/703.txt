instructions:
To prepare the gratinated eggs, first boil the eggs in plenty of water and let them cook for 8 minutes from the boiling point. After this time, immerse the eggs in cold water and then peel them .
Set them aside in a bowl . Prepare the béchamel: melt the butter in a saucepan , add the flour
and immediately after, gradually add the milk , stirring with a whisk to prevent lumps. Season with nutmeg , salt, and black pepper, and cook over low heat until it thickens, then turn off the heat .
Cut the smoked bacon into pieces and sauté it in a non-stick skillet until it's crispy .
Cut the eggs in half . Pour half of the béchamel on the bottom of the baking dish and arrange the eggs in the dish, close to each other. Add the bacon pieces .
Cover with the remaining béchamel . Finish with a sprinkle of black pepper and grated Parmigiano . Bake in a preheated oven in fan mode at 392°F for 15 minutes, placing the dish in the center of the oven. Remove the gratinated eggs from the oven and serve with a sprinkle of fresh parsley .
You can store the gratinated eggs in the refrigerator for a couple of days and eat them after reheating.
Plunging the hot eggs into cold water helps to peel them easily.
