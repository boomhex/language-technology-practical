Torta Susanna is one of those treats that folks in Parma—right in the heart of Emilia-Romagna—just cannot get enough of. And you know, this Parma dessert is famous for being super rich and comforting. It has a shortcrust pastry base that brings a nice tender bite every time you dig in. Really good stuff.
Now, the filling is where things get really interesting. It's got a layer of Italian ricotta cake that's smooth, moist, and just lightly sweet. All surrounded by that sturdy pastry shell. What's cool is how it stands out from similar desserts—like the torta di semolino—thanks to the combo of creamy ricotta and that glossy chocolate ganache topping . And here's the thing: the cake is named after Susanna, a local baker’s daughter from way back in the late 1800s. Pretty much adds some charm to each slice, right?
When you bite into a slice of Torta Susanna, you notice right away how the pastry stays super crispy and holds everything together. Plus, the inside gives you this perfect mix of sweet and a little tangy from the ricotta. I mean, the ganache on top is just super silky and packs that rich chocolate flavor everyone craves. Folks usually keep this cake in the fridge. And look, they say it tastes best when served cold—it makes the flavors stand out even more and gives the texture a nice contrast.
In Parma, you’ll see this classic Parma sweet at family get-togethers, bakeries, and all sorts of celebrations. It's not just a traditional Italian cake ; it’s like a little slice of local history that brings people together. Some families might swap in different chocolates or tweak the ricotta blend, but really, the basics stay the same. Good ingredients and a whole lot of pride in where it comes from.
Torta Susanna works great as a standout treat after dinner, during the holidays, or when you want something special and a bit luxurious—honestly, there’s nothing quite like the taste of Parma in every bite. Whether it’s a regular weekend or a big family feast, this cake adds a touch of elegance and a bit of nostalgia to any occasion.

To prepare the Susanna cake, start with the pastry. In a bowl, pour the flour, the baking powder , the cubed butter , and the sugar .
Knead with your hands until you get a crumbly mixture, then add the eggs and knead again with your hands .
When the mixture begins to take shape, transfer it to a surface and knead it quickly with your hands until you get a smooth dough . Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the cream. In a bowl, pour the egg yolks and sugar and beat them with an electric beater . When they are light and fluffy, add the well-drained ricotta .
Continue to work with the whisk to incorporate the ricotta. Heat the butter for 30 seconds in the microwave and add it to the mixture . Stir again to incorporate it into the cream , then store it in the fridge. Retrieve the pastry and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface .
You should obtain a uniform thickness of about 1/8 inch . Then transfer the pastry inside a 9.5-inch mold and make it adhere well. Then cut off the excess dough to leave an edge of 3/4-1 inch . Place in the fridge for 30 minutes. This step will help maintain the shape during baking.
At this point, transfer the cream inside and level it with a spatula . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 40 minutes.
After 40 minutes, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool. Meanwhile, prepare the coating: finely chop the dark chocolate . Pour the cream into a saucepan .
Add the butter , the honey , and heat it. As soon as it reaches a simmer, turn off the heat and pour it over the chocolate .
Stir with a spatula until you get a glossy and homogeneous mixture . Let it cool slightly, stirring occasionally, and pour it in the center of the cake .
By slightly tilting the cake , you will ensure that the ganache covers it entirely . Place in the fridge for a couple of hours before serving it .
The Susanna cake can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
Don't worry if the cake puffs up during baking. It will deflate as it cools, creating a dip for the ganache.
