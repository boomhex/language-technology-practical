instructions:
To prepare baked ziti, first prepare the tomato sauce: sauté a peeled and halved garlic clove in a pan with olive oil , then pour in the tomato sauce , add salt , pepper and let it cook for about 30-35 minutes over medium heat.
Meanwhile, cut the Provola Silana first into slices, then into strips, and finally into small cubes , do the same with the eggplants, slicing them thinly
then into strips, then into small cubes . In a pot, add vegetable oil and when it reaches a temperature of 340°F-355°F, fry the diced eggplants . Let them sizzle
and once they are golden brown , drain them using a slotted spoon and place them on a tray lined with paper towels to drain the frying oil . Then cook the pasta in a pot of boiling salted water.
Once cooked, drain it and place it in a large bowl, add a little olive oil to prevent sticking , add the tomato sauce
add the fresh torn basil , the diced Provola , and the eggplants .
Mix everything well to combine the ingredients , transfer the mixture to a 10-inch diameter baking dish , and place it under the preheated grill (at 465°F) for 5-6 minutes. Once gratinated, remove from the oven and your baked ziti will be ready to serve!
It is best to consume baked ziti immediately after preparation, otherwise, you can store them for 1 or 2 days at most in the refrigerator, in an airtight container.
If you want to add an extra touch of flavor to your baked ziti, you can add some chili pepper, and if you want to make your dish even richer, you can add hard-boiled eggs and salami.
