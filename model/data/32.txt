instructions:
To prepare the rice pudding, heat the milk in a high-sided saucepan over medium heat , use a small knife to cut a vanilla bean and scrape out the seeds by running the blade along the inside of the pod . Add half of the pod and the seeds into the milk .
Wash a lemon and peel the zest, then add it to the milk . Next, pour in the granulated sugar and the salt .
Stir to combine all the flavors and dissolve the sugar . Bring the milk just to a simmer and then add the rice (Carnaroli or Arborio) and cook on low heat, stirring occasionally . Keep on the heat for 30 minutes and if it becomes too dry, add more hot milk.
At the end of the preparation, the rice pudding should have a rather creamy consistency . When the rice is cooked, remove the lemon peels and vanilla pod . At this point, transfer the rice pudding into small individual bowls
and using a sieve dust each bowl of rice pudding with cinnamon powder or cocoa as you prefer, and in the same way, you can decide whether to enjoy the rice pudding just prepared, warm, or even cold!
Store the rice pudding in the refrigerator for 2 days, in a container covered with plastic wrap. We do not recommend freezing.
Rice pudding is a recipe prepared in many countries around the world, and depending on the region, it is flavored with different ingredients, for example, for Portugal's Arroz doce, cooked rice in milk is also enriched with egg yolks which give it a nice intense yellow color.
The nice thing about rice pudding is that it can be flavored: you can scent it with a note of maraschino or rum, enrich it with raisins, Rice and Apple Fritters , toasted pine nuts, or grated coconut, sprinkle it with chopped walnuts, hazelnuts, or almond slices (instead of cinnamon or cocoa). Versatile, cozy, and 100% customizable: a real delight!
