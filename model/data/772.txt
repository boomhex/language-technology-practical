instructions:
To prepare the Nutella ring cake, start by beating the eggs with an electric mixer for about 3 minutes. When they become frothy, add a pinch of salt and the sugar .
Continue beating for about 5 minutes , until you obtain a fluffy and foamy mixture. Add the seeds from the vanilla bean and mix for another minute .
Add the well-drained ricotta and the oil . Incorporate with the electric mixer until you achieve a smooth and homogeneous batter .
Pour the baking powder into the flour and mix. Sift half of the dry ingredients into the batter and continue mixing with the electric mixer until well absorbed .
Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix again with the mixer . Give a final stir with a spatula and transfer half of the batter into a 9-inch bundt pan, previously greased. Level the surface with the spatula .
Place the Nutella, using a spoon, inside the mold and cover with the remaining batter . Level the surface and bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for about 50 minutes .
Do the toothpick test before removing the cake from the mold . Let it cool slightly, turn it upside down onto a serving dish, and dust it with powdered sugar . The Nutella ring cake is ready to serve .
The Nutella ring cake can be stored at room temperature, under a glass dome, for up to 3 days.
Flavor the cake with lemon zest or by adding 2 tablespoons of rum to the batter.
