Garganelli with fava beans and speck is a dish that really really shows off what spring in Northern Italy is all about. Folks from Emilia-Romagna and Trentino-Alto Adige bring their own twist to traditional Italian dishes with this combo. You get the fresh pop of fava beans plus the rich flavor of speck from the mountains. And here's the thing—the real trick that makes this fava beans pasta different is how the pasta's cooked: only boiled halfway, then it finishes up right in the pan with the beans and speck. This move—"risottare"—lets the pasta's starch mix into everything—making it extra creamy and just a bit tender, not watery. Garganelli, those ridged, tube-shaped noodles, really grab the sauce, so every bite is packed with a little bit of everything. People love how the smokiness from the speck and the sweet green taste from the fava beans really wakes up your taste buds.

This dish is a great example of how a speck pasta dish pulls together local ingredients, and honestly, it works for anyone who loves mixing textures—a little bit moist from the sauce, a little crispy from the cured meat. Whether you’re into Italian pasta recipes or just want something that tastes like it came straight from an Italian spring picnic, garganelli with fava beans and speck hits the spot.

To make garganelli with fava beans and speck, start by preparing the Vegetable broth . In the meantime, proceed to clean the fava beans by shelling them : with the pods, you could prepare a tasty Sautéed Broad Bean Peels . Then remove the small growth above each fava bean and set aside the more tender ones, while you can peel the larger ones, meaning those with a more resistant skin : this way, you will have the sweetest and tenderest part of the seed.
Clean the shallot and finely chop it , then let it soften for a few minutes in a large pan with 1 ½ tbsp of oil .
Deglaze with white wine and, when the alcohol has evaporated, lower the heat and cook for 10 minutes, then add the fava beans ; let them flavor for a moment, then pour in the vegetable broth you prepared and cook for another 15 minutes .
Meanwhile, cut the speck into horizontal and vertical strips to obtain cubes no larger than ½ inch ; remove the top of the chili pepper and cut it in half ,
with the fingers of one hand, hold the tip of the chili pepper and with the other hand, in which you hold a knife, slide the blade in the opposite direction to the seeds and then cut into thin slices : this way, you'll have just the aroma of the chili pepper without spiciness. In another pan, pour the remaining 2 tsp of oil along with the chili pepper
and add the speck cubes ; let them cook on high heat for a few minutes, just enough time to make the speck crispy; stir occasionally and, when they are well browned, set them aside . Put a pot full of water on the stove and, when it boils, add salt. Cook the pasta halfway through .
When the garganelli are exactly halfway cooked, drain them and pour them into the pan where you cooked the fava beans (if necessary, add a bit of pasta cooking water) and continue cooking for the necessary time, also adding the speck with the chili pepper . In the meantime, grate the pecorino cheese
and, when the pasta is ready, turn off the heat. Sprinkle the cheese and oregano , mix all the ingredients , and finally plate the garganelli with fava beans and speck and serve them still very hot !
It is advisable to consume the garganelli with fava beans and speck immediately.
