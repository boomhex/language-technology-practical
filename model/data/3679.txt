Family dinners get a big boost with a crispy fried seafood feast—warm, golden bites straight from a mixed fry of fresh catch make any table feel a little more special. Around here, a heaping seafood platter tends to draw people in (kids especially go for the shrimp first!). Expect every piece, whether fish, shrimp, or bits of calamari, to come with a crunchy coating that’s just thick enough to give a really nice snap. The cornmeal coating is front and center, giving each bite a perfect balance between crisp outside and tender inside—maybe that’s why families keep reaching for one more piece. Visuals matter too: you’ve got a gorgeous array of golden seafood, maybe some cool lemon wedges on the side, and, honestly, the look alone usually gets everyone excited before the first bite even happens. Since a mixed fry of fresh catch always has a little something for everyone, even picky eaters end up joining in the fun. Simple flavors, DELICIOUS presentation, and a variety that breaks away from the usual dinner routine—that’s what makes people ask for this one again and again.
Busy home cooks appreciate meals that work for so many occasions—like this family fish fry that anchors easy gatherings or celebrates a weekend at home. Works just as well piled high as a main dish or spread out on trays for party sharing (tartar sauce nearby is pretty much required). You’ve got loads of versatility here: swap out fish for whatever’s freshest, toss in extra shrimp, or try adding a dash of spice if your crowd likes a little heat. Although quick to serve, this dish brings a real sense of special occasion to the table without stress—easy but impressive every time. Especially nice with a light salad or wedges of lemon for brightness, and if anyone asks, yes, leftovers reheat fairly well for next-day snacks. The fried seafood experience with a homemade batter delivers reliable, family-friendly success that keeps mealtime lively, fun, and absolutely SATISFYING. Often requested for group meals, always delicious , this quick seafood recipe is the kind of meal families remember for all the right reasons...lots of flavor, lots of smiles, and plenty to go around.
In this case, in our fry of fresh catch, we have small soles, cepolas (also known as ribbonfish or cutlassfish), and gobies. Proceed to clean the fish by removing the head and guts . In the case of cepolas, remove the dorsal and ventral fins running along the body by cutting them with scissors, then cut the fish into three parts .
If necessary, quickly rinse the fish under running water , pat them very well with kitchen paper to make them perfectly dry , and coat them in coarse semolina flour .
Fry the fish in plenty of seed oil (peanut oil is preferred) which you should maintain at the constant temperature of 347°F without ever exceeding it. Turn the fish over during frying and once golden, drain them and place them on kitchen paper to remove excess oil. Salt and serve immediately, accompanying the fry with a mixed salad or delicious French fries. P.S. The cepolas, after frying, are very crunchy and have really tasty meat, but be careful of the internal bone; by opening the already fried fish in half, you can easily remove it.
If you need to fry a large quantity of fish, place the already fried fish in a warm oven, arranging it on a baking sheet. In this way, it will stay warm while waiting for the fry to finish. If desired, you can accompany the fish with lemon wedges, mayonnaise, or cocktail sauce.
