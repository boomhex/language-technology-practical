To prepare the spinach cookies with salmon cream, rinse the spinach under running water and then pat it dry. Blanch the spinach for 1 minute in boiling salted water . Drain it and let it cool.
Transfer it to a blender container , add the flour , cold cubed butter
and blend the mixture by pulsing the blender for a few seconds at a time . Then transfer the mixture to a bowl, add the Parmesan , salt, and pepper .
Work everything with your hands until you get a homogeneous dough . Wrap it in plastic wrap and transfer it to the refrigerator for about ten minutes .
In the meantime, prepare the filling. Coarsely chop the smoked salmon . Transfer it to a bowl and dress it with the juice of half a lemon , a drizzle of oil
and mix everything . Then pour the ricotta into a bowl , add a drizzle of oil
chopped dill , a pinch of pepper and mix. Add the smoked salmon ,
mix again and transfer the mixture to a piping bag , which you will place in the refrigerator until use. Take the dough and roll it out between 2 sheets of parchment paper , until you obtain a thickness of about 1/8 inch.
Then cut out small discs using a 2-inch diameter cookie cutter and transfer them to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 15 minutes in the center of the oven. As you go, re-knead the scraps and cut out more cookies. If the dough becomes too soft, transfer it to the refrigerator. Once baked, remove the cookies and let them cool.
Once they are cool, take a cookie, place a bit of salmon cream in the center and close with another cookie to create a sandwich . Continue like this until you finish your spinach cookies with salmon cream and serve them .
Both the cookies and the cream can be prepared a day in advance. Once cool, the cookies should be stored in a tin box. The cream, however, should be placed in the refrigerator.
Once filled, it is recommended to consume them on the same day.
Instead of spinach, you can use chard.
For the filling, instead of ricotta, you can opt for a fresh spreadable cheese.
