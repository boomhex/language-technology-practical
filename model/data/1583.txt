instructions:
To prepare the limoncello and raisin cookies, first soak the raisins in water for about 15 minutes to rehydrate them. Then grate the lemon zest , squeeze the juice , and set both aside.
Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl. Then add the butter cut into cubes, the sugar , and start kneading everything with your hands .
When you have obtained a crumbly mixture, add the eggs , the limoncello , the lemon juice .
and the zest . Using a spoon, mix all the ingredients well and add the drained raisins .
Knead everything with your hands until you get a uniform mixture. Then cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Then take the dough and make small balls , you will get about 30. Roll them in powdered sugar .
and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , spacing them apart. Bake the cookies in a preheated static oven at 350°F (180°C) for 20 minutes. Once the cookies are ready, take them out of the oven, add more powdered sugar , and let them cool completely before enjoying them .
The limoncello and raisin cookies can be stored for up to 5 days in a tin box or a plastic bag in the pantry.
For a more indulgent variation, you can replace the raisins with milk chocolate chips. Let the cookies rest at room temperature for at least 2-3 hours before serving. This will make them dry and crunchy on the outside and soft inside.
