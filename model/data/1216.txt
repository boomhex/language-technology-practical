instructions:
To prepare the orange cookies, first ensure that all the ingredients are at room temperature. In a bowl, pour the flour, baking powder , sugar , and grated orange zest .
Add a pinch of salt and the cubed butter . Squeeze the orange and filter the juice through a strainer .
Add the juice to the dough and finally the egg yolks . Knead by hand to combine all the ingredients .
Then transfer the dough to a work surface and form two logs . From these, cut pieces weighing about 1 oz each .
Roll the pieces into balls with your hands and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Then press down on the surface with a whisk to leave an imprint .
This will create a decorative pattern reminiscent of orange segments . Now bake the orange cookies in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 25 minutes. Once ready, remove them from the oven and let them cool before serving .
The orange cookies can be stored in a tin box for a week. You can freeze the raw shortbread dough.
If you don't have a whisk, you can use the blade of a knife to create the surface decoration.
