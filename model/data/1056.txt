instructions:
To prepare the yogurt focaccia, pour the yeast and water into a small bowl , mix until dissolved . Then add the honey and stir well.
Pour the flour and salt into the bowl of a stand mixer , attach the flat beater and run for a few seconds to lighten the mixture . Then pour in the dissolved yeast ,
and run the motor at low speed until well blended . Add the yogurt and run the machine until completely absorbed. Finally, add the oil . Run the stand mixer again, and once you have a uniform dough, increase the speed and wait until the dough is well kneaded.
Cover with plastic wrap and a dish towel and let rise in a turned-off oven with the light on until it triples in volume . It will take about 3 hours.
At this point, take the dough and transfer it to a floured work surface . Work it quickly without deflating it too much and form a ball . Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and the dish towel, and place in a turned-off oven with the light on to rise. This time an hour will suffice and the dough should double.
Take the dough and transfer it to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Gently spread the dough with your hands, gently pulling the side edges to create a rectangular shape . Prepare a quick brine by pouring water, salt into a small bowl
and oil . Mix well and use it to brush the surface of the focaccia . Finish with a few rosemary needles ,
cover with the dish towel and let it rest for half an hour . At this point, bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F on the middle shelf for about 25 minutes or until the focaccia is well golden on the surface (adjust according to your oven's power). Then remove from the oven and serve the yogurt focaccia.
Yogurt focaccia keeps in the bread bag for 2-3 days or can be frozen in a closed plastic food bag.
Yogurt focaccia can also be kneaded by hand without using the stand mixer, using a large bowl and working the dough energetically for a few minutes.
