To prepare the pizza with yellow cherry tomatoes, anchovies, and capers, start with the dough. Pour the flours and crumbled yeast into a bowl. Add the water a little at a time ,
while kneading with your hands . Once all the water has been added and the dough begins to take shape , pour in the oil in a thin stream ,
continuing to knead . When it starts to absorb, add the salt and continue kneading until the dough is smooth and homogeneous, then transfer it to the work surface and knead it for a few more minutes .
At this point, cover it with the clean bowl and leave it on the counter for about ten minutes . After this time, give it a fold. Imagine the sphere is divided into 4 parts, take each end, stretch it gently and fold it toward the center .
Repeat this operation for all 4 ends , then flip the dough and shape it into a sphere .
Transfer the formed dough into an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rise until it doubles in size, which will take about 2 hours at room temperature . After the rising time, the dough will be nice and puffy, so transfer it to a lightly floured work surface
and divide it into 4 portions of about 7 oz each . As done before, bring the edges of the dough toward the center and shape each ball into a sphere .
Gradually transfer them onto a greased tray, then cover with plastic wrap and let them rise for 30 minutes . Meanwhile, place the pizza stone in the upper part of the oven and heat it to 480°F in convection mode. Shred the mozzarella with your hands and store it in the fridge.
When the balls are ready, take the first one, transfer it to a floured surface and press it from the center with your fingertips . Gently spread it while leaving the outer part thicker , so that a crust forms during baking.
Move the dough onto a peel, being careful not to damage it . Arrange the cherry tomatoes in the center and season with oil
and salt. Bake and let it cook for about ten minutes. Remove the pizza with the peel and transfer it to a cutting board , garnish it with the shredded mozzarella ,
the capers , and the anchovies drained of oil . Proceed in this way for all the other pizzas and enjoy them .
We recommend consuming the pizza immediately. Alternatively, once baked, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 days.
Instead of fresh yeast, you can use 2 g of dry yeast. Instead of flour, you can use semolina to stretch the pizzas. It won't absorb and will allow for a better result during baking.
