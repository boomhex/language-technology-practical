instructions:
To prepare Calabrian turdilli, first pour the water, vermouth , oil , and sugar into a saucepan. Heat until all the sugar is dissolved. Then let it cool.
Meanwhile, place the flour in a bowl, add the ground cloves , cinnamon powder , and grated orange zest . Mix and create a well in the center of the flour.
Gradually pour the liquids into the flour while mixing with a fork . Transfer everything onto a work surface and continue kneading with your hands .
You should obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough . Divide it in half and form ropes with a diameter of about 3/4 inches. Then cut them into pieces 2 inches long .
Roll each piece on a gnocchi board , or use the prongs of a fork, applying light pressure to achieve the characteristic ridges of the sweet. If necessary, use a little flour. Place the turdilli on a tray dusted with flour . Heat the sunflower oil to 356°F. If you don't have a kitchen thermometer, you can dip a wooden stick into the oil; if bubbles form around it, the oil is at the right temperature. Fry a few turdilli at a time, so as not to lower the oil temperature too much, until they are golden .
Drain them and place them on absorbent paper to remove excess oil. Once finished frying, immediately transfer the still warm turdilli into a bowl, pour in the fig honey , and mix well so that each piece is fully coated.
Then place them on a serving plate and decorate with colored sprinkles . Your Calabrian turdilli are ready to be enjoyed !
Calabrian turdilli can be stored at room temperature, under a glass dome, for 3-4 days.
As with all traditional recipes, the turdilli recipe varies from family to family. In some recipes, after frying the turdilli, once cooled, they are dipped in heated fig honey just long enough to coat them well. They are then transferred to a serving plate for decoration. You can vary the recipe by adding or changing the spices in the dough. You can decorate them as you like or leave them with just the honey.
