instructions:
To prepare the amaretti with cherries in syrup, pour the almonds into a mixer along with the sugar . Grind them until they become a powder . Transfer the obtained mixture into a bowl .
Add the egg white and mix with a spatula to combine the dough. Now take a small portion of dough about the size of a walnut and weighing approximately 1 oz. Form balls with your hands , you will get about 24.
Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , then moisten your fingers with water and press in the center of each ball to create a hollow . Fill all the cookies with a cherry and its syrup .
Dust the surface with powdered sugar and bake in a static oven at 320 °F for 40 minutes. Once cooked, take out the baking sheet , let it cool slightly, and then serve your amaretti with cherries in syrup .
You can store the amaretti for 2-3 days in a glass or tin jar, or in a freezer bag. We do not recommend freezing the raw dough; instead, you can freeze the already formed raw cookies, but without the filling, arranged on a tray with some space between them.
To help you form the balls, slightly moisten your hands; this way, the dough will not be too sticky.
