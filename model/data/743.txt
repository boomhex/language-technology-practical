instructions:
To prepare the chickpea farinata with artichokes, put the chickpea flour in a bowl and pour in some of the water at room temperature . Mix everything well, taking care not to form lumps, and continue to pour the water until you obtain a liquid and homogeneous mixture .
Cover with plastic wrap and let the mixture rest out of the fridge for a minimum of 5 hours to a maximum of 10 hours, stirring it from time to time. After the necessary time, you will notice foam on the surface: remove it with a skimmer , until you eliminate it all .
Add 1.5 tbsp of oil and salt to the mixture. Mix well with a whisk. Drain the artichokes well and cut them into wedges or simply in half if they are not very large .
Grease 3 trays with a diameter of 12.5 inches with plenty of extra virgin olive oil (traditionally, copper or aluminum trays would be used, but you can also use a simple non-stick tray) , and with a ladle distribute the chickpea mixture over them . Consider that you will need 1/3 for each. Add the previously cut oil-packed artichokes .
Add some thyme leaves too , then bake in a preheated static oven at 482°F and cook in the lower part of the oven, in contact with the bottom, for the first 10 minutes. After this time, move the tray to the upper part of the oven and let it cook for another 10 minutes until the farinata is well browned. Remove the farinata from the oven and finish the preparation by decorating the surface with hand-shredded mozzarella and thyme and marjoram leaves .
We recommend consuming the chickpea and artichoke farinata immediately. Alternatively, it can be stored in the fridge for 1 or 2 days, but we recommend adding the mozzarella only when serving, after you have reheated it.
Instead of thyme and marjoram leaves, you can flavor the farinata with rosemary or sage.
