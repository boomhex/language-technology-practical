To prepare the baked scad with artichokes and peas, first take care of cleaning the artichokes. Cut off the tougher part of the stem and remove the tougher outer leaves which could be too hard when cooked. Using a sharp knife, peel the stem
and cut off the tip of the artichoke . Cut it in half , remove the inner choke
and cut each half into two quarters . As you go, place the artichoke wedges in a bowl filled with water, where you have squeezed the lemon to prevent them from turning brown . Once all the artichokes are cut, drain them and transfer them to a pan where you have already sautéed the garlic clove with 2 tbsps of oil .
Let them cook over medium-high heat for 5-6 minutes , then deglaze with the white wine and once all the alcohol has evaporated, add the peas .
Salt, pepper , cover with a lid , and let it cook for 10 minutes. After the necessary time, transfer them to a baking dish spreading them well on the bottom;
then take your scad fillets and place them on the layer of artichokes and peas with the skin facing the bottom ; sprinkle them with a tablespoon of oil and prepare the breadcrumbs.
Pick the thyme and sage leaves, then chop them finely and mix them with the breadcrumbs . Then stir to obtain a homogeneous mixture
and sprinkle it over your scad fillets . Drizzle with another tablespoon of oil and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 15 minutes, turning on the grill mode in the last 3-4 minutes. Once cooked, serve your baked scad with artichokes and peas still steaming !
You can store the baked scad with artichokes and peas for a maximum of one day in the refrigerator. Freezing is not recommended.
For an even more aromatic flavor, try adding the grated zest of a lemon to the breadcrumbs!
