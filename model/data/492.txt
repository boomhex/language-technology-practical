instructions:
To prepare the tofu in the air fryer, first, pat dry the block of tofu with a paper towel, then cut it in half and then into strips . Finally, cut into cubes about 1/2 inch large .
Place them in a bowl and season with soy sauce , oil , and curry .
Mix , cover with plastic wrap and let marinate for at least 15 minutes. Then drain the cubes from the marinade .
Bread them with breadcrumbs and remove the excess with a sieve before transferring them into the air fryer basket (we used a 6-liter capacity fryer) .
Cook at 356°F for 15-16 min until the cubes are well browned . Transfer to a small bowl, add a good pinch of salt , and serve the tofu with your favorite sauce .
We recommend serving the tofu immediately.
If you don't like curry, you can omit it or replace it with another spice you love, like paprika or cumin! If you're short on time, you can skip the marinating step; alternatively, if you want to extend it, store the tofu in the fridge for even a couple of days.
