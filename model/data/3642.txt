The first thing to do in making zelten is to prepare the dried and candied fruits, the main ingredients of this recipe. Take the candied fruit and cut it into cubes (1-2). Then place the grated lemon and orange peels, nutmeg, and cinnamon in small bowls .
Next, take care of the dried fruit . Put the raisins, halved Malaga grapes, and dried figs with the hard stems removed and cut into strips in a large bowl . Add two small glasses of rum to the dried fruit, mix well and let the fruit fully absorb the liquid . Meanwhile, warm and melt 2.5 oz of honey with the wine in a saucepan .
When the figs, raisins, and Malaga grapes have absorbed the rum, add coarsely chopped walnuts, almonds cut into sticks, halved hazelnuts , candied fruits , grated lemon and orange peels , ground cloves, and the wine with honey. Mix well, ensuring all ingredients are combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the mixture rest for at least an hour (or overnight if you prefer to prepare the zelten over two days) to allow all the aromas to be absorbed.
Meanwhile, crumble the yeast cube in a small bowl and add a teaspoon of honey , cover with warm water , mix, and wait for foam to form on the surface. Meanwhile, prepare the rye and wheat flour .
In a bowl, combine the two types of flour with caraway and anise , then add the yeast mixture and the tablespoon of oil .
Knead everything until you obtain a compact, soft but not sticky dough and let it rise in a flour-dusted bowl until it doubles in volume .
Take the bowl with the dried fruit and pour the contents onto a work surface , place the dough on top and knead everything well until you get a homogeneous dough that does not crumble .
Divide the dough into eight equally sized pieces and shape them as you prefer, (round, heart-shaped, rectangular, oval, square) as long as the zelten are about 3/4 inch thick. Brush the zelten with sugar syrup or rather fluid honey (melt it over the fire) . Let them rest and dry for 30 minutes, then decorate them as you like with dried and candied fruit . Brush the zelten again with sugar and bake at 300/320 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let your zelten cool, then wrap them in plastic wrap and let them rest for 10-15 days in a dry place before consuming.
