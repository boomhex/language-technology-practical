Vegetarian sushi is all about that color and freshness, really showing off the beauty of Japanese food. And look, when you’ve got a bamboo mat to roll things up tight with sheets of nori seaweed —which is awesome—everything comes together. You end up with these neat little veggie sushi rolls that look like they’re from a super fancy sushi spot. The combo of creamy avocado, thinly sliced beetroot, and crunchy radicchio makes these rolls stand out, no question. Each bite gives you something different—sometimes it’s tender avocado, other times it’s earthy beet or crisp radicchio. Seriously good stuff. These rolls aren’t just colorful on the plate—they taste as lively as they look, no kidding. It’s a fun way to bring some plant-based flair to your table. For sure.
Making vegetarian sushi at home is a big part of the fun. People love putting their own spin on the fillings, mixing in things like sweet mango or spicy cucumber for a flavor punch. And truthfully, even though it takes practice to get those sushi rolls just right, the process is calming—lining up your veggies, spreading the sushi rice, and rolling everything up just so. I gotta say, it’s easier than most folks think, especially with a basic sushi-making kit. Thing is, these vegetable sushi rolls make a great snack or dinner for anyone craving something light but satisfying. Serve them with a splash of soy sauce, some pickled ginger, and you’ve got a plate that looks awesome and tastes even better. Plant-based sushi like this is a real crowd-pleaser, bringing a bit of Japanese artistry to any table—whether it’s a laid-back weekday meal or a themed dinner with friends. There’s just something about a tray of moist, fragrant veggie sushi rolls that gets people excited to dig in and share. Pretty simple, right? It's a perfect dish for those looking to explore the bright flavors of Japanese cuisine without meat, making every meal a special occasion. Really, really special.
To prepare vegetarian sushi, start by cooking the rice. Take a high-sided pot and pour in the water and rice . Cover with the lid and bring to a boil . When the water boils, lower the heat and let it cook on low for about 15 minutes. Do not stir the rice. When it's cooked, transfer the rice to a bowl and add the vinegar .
Gently stir the rice with a spoon or wooden spatula until it reaches room temperature (you can fan it simultaneously with a small fan or a plastic plate to cool it and evaporate the vinegar faster) and set it aside. Then focus on the vegetables. Rinse the vegetables thoroughly and proceed with the preparation of the radicchio: remove the final part of the head , then detach the leaves and remove the central white rib from each one . Place the radicchio leaves obtained in a small bowl and set aside.
Then take the beetroot: cut it into thin slices of 1/4 inch and set aside . Move on to the avocado: cut it in half, remove the inner pit and then dice it into small cubes of about 1/4 inch. Finally, take the cucumbers, trim them, and peel them with a vegetable peeler .
Take one and cut it in half, then slice it lengthwise into slices of 1/4 inch . These cucumber slices will be used for the maki filling. Then take the other cucumber and cut it in half lengthwise . Then slice it very thinly horizontally, keeping them together as you cut . These latter will be used to decorate the top outer part of the maki.
Now apply pressure with your fingers on the small cucumber slices still joined to lay them out to create a slanted row and set aside. These slices will be used to decorate the top of the maki. At this point, take a bamboo mat and place a sheet of transparent plastic wrap on it . Moisten your hands in a bowl of slightly acidulated water to prevent the rice, which will be quite sticky, from sticking to them. Place about 3 1/2 oz of rice on the bamboo mat, creating a rectangle of about 4x6 inches. Lay the 3 strips of beetroot in the center .
placing them one after the other; next to them, create a row of cucumber strips and then another of beetroot to create a color alternation. Finally, place the avocado strips on top . Now you can make the maki: grab the lower edge of the bamboo mat, lift it to bring it towards the center .
Apply light pressure with your hands starting from the center of the roll and sliding outward to compact it . Then pull the lower edge of the mat forward (as in figure 18), applying pressure again with your hands from the center to slide them to the edges. During these operations, the mat should not roll on itself but only facilitate the closing of the roll. Repeat the operation until the two ends of the rice meet to obtain your maki. Now move the pressed cucumber slices onto the top of the maki using a spatula to keep them compact . Arrange them to cover the entire surface of the maki and, if necessary, adjust them using your hands . Then proceed again to compact the maki with the mat as you did in the previous steps to compact the decoration as well.
Then place the maki on a cutting board, trim the undecorated ends if necessary, and cut it in half . Then divide to obtain 8 pieces . Proceed with the second preparation. Take the bamboo mat again and line it with a sheet of plastic wrap; lay a nori seaweed sheet on it. Spread the rice on the seaweed, leaving about 3/4 inch of seaweed free on the upper side .
Place a halved radicchio leaf in the center, then lay a row of cucumber slices on top , and a row of avocado next to it . Then gently roll the bamboo mat as indicated in the previous steps to compact the maki .
Finally, trim the ends if necessary and cut the maki in half , then divide each half to obtain pieces about 3/4 inch thick . Your vegetarian sushi is ready to be enjoyed !
It is best to consume vegetarian sushi as soon as it is made. However, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two days covered with transparent plastic wrap.
Let your imagination run wild! Have fun pairing vegetables with different tastes and colors: you can create personalized vegetarian sushi! And remember, the secret of sushi lies in the knives: use a sharp one for all cutting stages!
