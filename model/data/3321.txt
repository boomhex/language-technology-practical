instructions:
To prepare the pizzaiola-style rolls, start by placing the crushed garlic clove in a large pan with the oil. Brown the garlic and then add the tomato sauce , season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer. Finally, add the oregano and parsley. While the sauce is cooking, lightly pound the slices of meat with a meat mallet, and even them out if they are very irregular. Cut the mozzarella (or scamorza) into thin slices and let it drain on a sieve to remove as much water as possible. Finely chop the black olives .
On each slice of meat, place 2/3 well-drained slices of mozzarella , distribute the chopped olives , and roll the meat from the short side like a roll ,
which you will secure with two toothpicks . Place the prepared rolls in the sauce , salt them on both sides, cover with a lid, and cook over a very low heat (the sauce should just simmer) for about 20 minutes. At the end of cooking , adjust the salt. If the mozzarella has released water during cooking, remove the rolls from the pan, keep them warm, and slightly reduce the sauce! Serve the rolls hot with some mashed potatoes or boiled rice!
Store the pizzaiola-style rolls in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for a couple of days at most.
For a more "grown-up" version, you can replace the mozzarella with scamorza and the olives with herbs: anything but diet-friendly, as you end up eating a ton of bread with it, but delicious.
