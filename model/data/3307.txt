Schiacciate con cime di rapa piccanti e salsiccia is a super tasty treat you'll find at lively gatherings in Puglia , way down in Southern Italy. It's a mix of spicy Italian flatbread topped with tender cime di rapa—like turnip greens, but with more bite—and juicy, crispy sausage. And the bread? It's perfectly golden on the outside. In Puglia, using cime di rapa is common, but combining it with sausage , garlic, and chili gives it a bold kick. Really wakes up your taste buds. A quick sauté brings out the tangy notes of the greens and makes the sausage moist and flavorful. Every bite is spicy, savory, and a bit crispy from the bread. Really, it’s like a bite-sized meal.
This kind of Italian flatbread sandwich is a classic for a reason—so fun to eat. People always reach for seconds. The broccoli rabe and sausage recipe is popular all over Apulia.
