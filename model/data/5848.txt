Check out more appetizers for your 4th of July party:

Heat a medium casserole over medium heat and add the oil and garlic. Sauté until fragrant.
Add the cherry tomatoes, sugar, vinegar and spices to the casserole. Stir well to combine.
Cook the mixture on medium-low heat for approximately 20 minutes until the tomatoes have released their juices and the mixture has thickened into a syrupy consistency.
Incorporate the ginger into the casserole and continue cooking for a few additional minutes.
Next, add the bourbon to the mixture and continue cooking until it reaches a thick consistency. This process should take around 2 hours in total.
NOTE: To check the final texture of the jam, place a small dollop on a cold plate and observe how it cools and sets.
Remove the casserole from the stove and taste the jam for saltiness. It should lean towards the sweeter side.
Transfer the jam to a suitable container and refrigerate until it is ready to be served.
Slice the burrata mozzarella and try to keep each slice together with its core intact. For optimal results, I recommend freezing it for approximately 30 minutes.
Place a slice of burrata on each piece of toasted bread. Sprinkle a pinch of salt lightly over the cheese. Add a spoonful (or adjust to taste) of tomato jam on top and, if desired, garnish with a drizzle of balsamic reduction.
Serve and enjoy!
Start by cutting the watermelon into approximately 8 to 10 slices.
Choose the most central slices and drizzle them with olive oil on one side.
Arrange the slices on plates and cut each slice into 6 wedges.
Sprinkle feta cheese and blueberries on top. If desired, garnish with mint leaves and, optionally, drizzle with balsamic glaze. For an extra touch, you can also sprinkle bee pollen.
Serve the watermelon wedges immediately.
As for the remaining watermelon, you can cut it into cubes and add it to a salad along with any leftover feta cheese and berries.
