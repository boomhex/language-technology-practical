Marjoram is one of the most popular spices in Italian and Greek cuisine. The leaves, which are the edible part, are very aromatic and rich in vitamin C, essential oils, tannins, and rosmarinic acid, which is present in many herbs such as rosemary, oregano, thyme, peppermint, lemon balm, sage, and marjoram itself. Thanks to its properties and characteristics, marjoram is used not only in cooking but also in herbal medicine, aromatherapy, and even cosmetics. This pesto is traditionally used in Ligurian cuisine to dress stamped corzetti.
