instructions:
To prepare the smash burger, first combine the ground beef and ground pork in a bowl , pepper , and knead with your hands to obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator while you prepare the other ingredients for the bun; you should have everything ready so you can cook the burgers at the last minute. Cut the buns in half , then spread the bottom part with mayonnaise .
Add lettuce leaves and cut the pickles into slices . Set aside and place an iron, cast iron, or steel pan over the heat; it should be very hot. Meanwhile, take the meat mixture, divide it into 4 portions of about 3.5 oz each, and shape them into a patty with your hands .
Place one patty at a time in the hot pan , then immediately smash it with a meat press, taking care to press very hard to flatten the meat well . After 60 seconds, flip the burger with a spatula .
Let the other side cook for a maximum of a minute and a half , then transfer the burger to a plate and proceed in the same way to cook the others. Immediately cover the burgers with sliced cheese so that it melts with the heat .
Now you are ready to complete the buns: stack 2 burgers with cheese on each bun , then add sliced pickles. Finally, close with the top of the bun that you will have spread with ketchup . Your fantastic smash burgers are ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume the smash burgers immediately.
Non-stick pans are not recommended for cooking burgers as they do not retain heat well.
It is important to cook one burger at a time to ensure it forms a nice crust.
