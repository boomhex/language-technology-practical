Really really awesome.
To prepare the gift box cake, start with the sponge cake using the hot method: pour the whole eggs, with wildflower or acacia honey and sugar into a mixing bowl (or a bowl over a bain-marie): it is important that the water in the pot does not reach the bottom of the mixing bowl. Beat the mixture with a whisk and heat it to 104°F (you can measure the temperature with a food thermometer).
Transfer the mixture to a stand mixer and whisk it (you can also use an electric beater) at medium speed for about ten minutes (4-5); then sift the all-purpose flour and pistachio flour ,
fold them into the mixture with a spatula ; slightly heat the pistachio paste (this will ensure it is at the same temperature as the batter) and dilute it with a spoonful of the mixture . Add it to the batter, mix, then pour everything into a 10x7 inch rectangular pan lined with parchment paper . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 20-25 minutes (320°F for about 10-15 minutes if using a fan oven).
Once baked, remove it from the oven , let it cool slightly, then remove the sponge cake from the pan and let it cool completely on a wire rack. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: wash the strawberries, remove the green leaves, and place them in a blender . Blend to obtain a smooth puree that you can pass through a sieve to remove any lumps.
Whip the very cold cream with the powdered sugar using an electric beater , then add the strawberry puree and gently fold with a spatula to make the mixture uniform . Cover and refrigerate while you cut the now cooled sponge cake: cut it in half and further divide each half into two rectangles, obtaining 4 layers.
Place a rectangle of sponge cake on a serving plate, spread a layer of cream evenly , and continue alternating a layer of sponge cake and a layer of cream, ending with the latter (17-18). Place the cake in the refrigerator for at least two hours to set, while you continue with the preparation.
Focus on the coating. Heat the cream and pour it over the white chocolate , stir to melt it completely, and if necessary, blend it with an immersion blender to avoid lumps . Let it cool, then once cool, pour it over the cake placed on a wire rack starting from the center , to completely cover the whole cake.
To make the chocolate bow, take the dark chocolate and melt it in a bain-marie (or in the microwave), without exceeding 88°F. Then cut rectangular strips of acetate sheets (available at stationery stores): 2 of 1.5 inches thick and 11.8 inches long that can cross the cake, covering both the surface and the edges: these will be the ribbons that close the gift box cake. Then cut multiple small rectangles of acetate 4x0.6 inches to create the bow loops and arrange them on a sheet of parchment paper . Set aside a little melted chocolate in a piping bag, spread the rest over the acetate strips, spreading it carefully with a spatula .
To set the strips (25-25), proceed as follows: place them in the freezer for about 5 minutes. As you detach the acetate strips from the chocolate, you will need to put them back in the freezer for a few moments to set again. When you need to bend the strips to form the bow, the chocolate should be sufficiently malleable. To decorate the cake: gently lay the first long strip on the now cooled cake, placing the chocolate side on the surface, then gently peel off the acetate ; adhere the chocolate strip to the sides of the cake as well.
Cross the other chocolate strip and gently peel off the acetate. Now proceed to make the ribbon bow: remove the acetate from the chocolate strips (if you see it starting to melt, follow the instructions by placing it back in the freezer for a few moments) and attach the two ends ;
lay the folded strip on the cake, sealing with a little melted chocolate from the piping bag , continue distributing the first 4 strips radially, while you lay the others on top to simulate the ribbon folds . Squeeze a little chocolate in the middle of the bow to seal, and your gift box cake is ready to be served !
Store the gift box cake in the refrigerator for 1-2 days. You can freeze it if you have used all fresh, non-defrosted ingredients. The sponge cake can be prepared in advance and stored under a glass dome for 1-2 days. The cream keeps in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 1-2 days.
Try reversing the colors! Cover the gift box cake with a dark chocolate coating and make a white chocolate bow!
