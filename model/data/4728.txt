To prepare the cannelloni stuffed with artichoke and sausage ragù, first cut the stalks of the Swiss chard ; set them aside as they will be needed for the ragù. Put the Swiss chard leaves in a pot with half a glass of water , cover with a lid and let them wilt for 2 minutes. Drain and let them cool slightly, then squeeze the Swiss chard well to remove as much water as possible .
Chop finely with a knife . On the work surface, place the flour and semolina in a well, then pour the eggs and the Swiss chard into the center.
Incorporate the flour first with a fork , then with a dough scraper and finally knead with your hands until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough . Let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes, covered by a bowl.
Finely chop the Swiss chard stalks and then focus on cleaning the artichokes : remove the tougher outer leaves , then cut off the tips .
Cut the artichokes in half and remove the choke . As you clean them, immerse them in acidulated water .
In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil, then crumble the sausage and brown it over medium heat. When it starts to brown, add the onion , celery, and carrots that you have previously finely chopped . Cook for a couple of minutes.
Slice the artichokes thinly and add them to the pan , then salt, pepper and cook for 10 minutes. At this point, add the Swiss chard stalks and mix.
Deglaze with white wine and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon . Lower the heat, cover with a lid leaving a small opening and cook for about 20 minutes. After this time, turn off the heat and let cool completely.
In the meantime, prepare the béchamel: melt the butter in a saucepan, then add the flour and stir quickly. When you have obtained a blond roux, pour in the milk a little at a time , stirring continuously to eliminate lumps. Bring to a boil and turn off the heat; it should be quite liquid. Adjust salt and pepper .
Finally, flavor with the nutmeg . Take the dough again and cut a portion; keep the remaining dough covered to prevent it from drying out. Roll out the dough with a pasta machine, starting from the thickest setting and folding it, especially during the first passes .
Continue in this way until you reach the thinnest setting and until the dough is used up; you should obtain sheets about 0.04 inches thick. Cut the sheets into rectangles measuring 4x5.5 inches . Stuff the rectangles with plenty of filling and roll up .
Butter a baking dish and pour about half of the béchamel on the bottom, covering the edges as well . Place the cannelloni in the baking dish with the seam side down , then cover with the remaining béchamel .
Distribute the remaining artichoke and sausage ragù on top , then finish with grated Parmesan and some small knobs of butter . Bake in a static oven at 356°F for 20-25 minutes; if necessary, you can switch to the grill setting for the last 2-3 minutes. The cannelloni stuffed with artichoke and sausage ragù are ready to be served !
The cannelloni stuffed with artichoke and sausage ragù can be stored in the refrigerator, covered with cling film or in a closed container, for 1-2 days.
If you prefer a more uniform-colored dough, you can blend the Swiss chard with the eggs and then add the mixture to the flours.
Instead of Swiss chard, you can use spinach.
If you prefer a milder flavor, you can replace the sausage with ground turkey or chicken.
For a vegetarian version, omit the sausage and increase the amount of artichokes, perhaps adding ricotta or fresh cheeses for a creamy filling.
Add a few leaves of thyme or chopped rosemary to the artichoke and sausage ragù to enhance the aroma.
