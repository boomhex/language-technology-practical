instructions:
To prepare the soft potato brioche, start by working with the potatoes. Boil them in unsalted water for 30-40 minutes, depending on their size . Once cooked, drain and peel them , then slice them .
Mash the potatoes well with a fork and let them cool completely. The amount of cooked potatoes to use in the dough will be 150 g (5.3 oz). In the meantime, melt the butter in a saucepan and let it cool . Place half of the flour (150 g / 1.2 cups) into the bowl of a stand mixer .
Add the 150 g of boiled potatoes (5.3 oz), the crumbled yeast , and the honey .
Then add the milk and turn on the stand mixer with the K or leaf beater at low speed . Mix until you get a homogeneous mixture .
Add the egg , sugar , and turn on the machine again, still at low speed , until fully absorbed.
Then incorporate the rest of the flour (150 g / 1.2 cups), a few tablespoons at a time . Continuing to knead you will notice that the dough will start to take shape and come away from the sides of the bowl .
Lastly, add the melted butter, now cool , and the salt . Now turn the machine to medium speed and work the dough until you obtain a homogeneous mixture.
Replace the leaf with the kneading hook . Work the dough for 10 minutes at medium speed; it should be well-bound and elastic . Grease a rather large bowl with a little oil. Lightly grease your hands as well, take the dough, form a ball, and place it inside the bowl .
Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in the turned-off oven with the light on for 2 hours, or until doubled in volume . After this time, turn the risen dough onto a floured work surface .
Flatten it with your fingertips and roll it out with a rolling pin, creating a rectangle of 12x10 inches . With a knife, cut the rectangle lengthwise into 3 strips of the same size . Roll each strip from the long side to form 3 cords .
Starting from the center, braid the 3 cords , always bringing the outer one to the center, first from one side, then the other . Continue this way until you finish one of the sides .
Now braid the other side to create a braid. Grease a 10x4.5 inch loaf pan and place the braid inside, lifting it at the ends with your hands. Cover the pan and the braid with a clean cloth and let rise in the turned-off oven with the light on for 45 minutes .
Once your braid has risen, gently brush it with milk using a kitchen brush . Now bake it. Bake in a preheated static oven at 180°C (356°F) for 30 minutes. To prevent the surface from burning, cover with a sheet of aluminum foil during the last 10 minutes. Once baked, take your brioche out of the oven .
Remove it from the pan without burning yourself and transfer it to a wire rack . Cover with 2 clean tea towels and let cool before serving your soft potato brioche .
The soft potato brioche can be stored in a food bag for 3 days at room temperature. It can also be frozen, whole or already sliced.
You can decorate the surface, after brushing with milk, with sesame seeds or with sugar granules. You can also add sliced olives, ham cubes or bacon, or chocolate chips or dried fruit to the dough. For a sweet version, it is recommended to use 80 g (2.8 oz) of sugar and reduce the salt to 5 grams. You will have a large brioche braid to enjoy for breakfast. If using dry yeast, you will need 3 grams. You can also prepare the dough by hand, following the same order of ingredient addition. Initially use a fork to incorporate the liquid ingredients, then work the dough with your hands.
