To prepare the peach cake, start by adding the eggs , the egg yolk , and the brown sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer.
Add a pinch of salt and start mixing with the whisk (alternatively, you can use an electric mixer) . Once you have a light and foamy mixture that forms ribbons, add the ricotta cheese .
Also add the vegetable oil and continue mixing to combine . At this point, sift the all-purpose flour .
Add the whole wheat flour , then sift in the potato starch and baking powder . Mix at low speed to incorporate the dry ingredients well .
Once you have a homogeneous batter , pour it into an 8.5-inch diameter baking pan lined with parchment paper (or greased and lined) . Now wash the peaches and cut them into thin slices .
Arrange the peach slices in a circular pattern on the surface of the batter , being careful not to place them too tightly together . Bake the cake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 35-40 minutes . Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool .
Remove the cake from the pan and transfer it to a serving plate . Mix the peach jam with a little water using a brush .
Brush the peaches on top with the diluted jam to glaze them . Finally, dust with powdered sugar . Your peach cake is ready to be enjoyed !
The peach cake can be stored at room temperature, covered with a glass dome or plastic wrap for 2-3 days. If the house temperature is high, it's preferable to store it in the refrigerator.
Alternatively, you can freeze it in slices for up to 2 months.
To further enhance the flavor of the peach cake, try adding a pinch of cinnamon or some grated lemon zest to the batter.
Do not use overly ripe peaches as their juice could affect the baking process.
