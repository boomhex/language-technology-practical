To prepare fish ravioli with cherry tomatoes, first boil the potatoes . While the potatoes are cooking, make the pasta: sift the flour into a bowl, and add the salt and eggs . Knead everything with your hands ,
until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough, then wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 min. Meanwhile, wash the herbs, place them in a pan with oil and garlic and sauté; add salt and pepper, cover with a lid and let cook for about 3-4 minutes.
Once cooked, drain the herbs with a colander to remove their water , then take the potatoes, peel them and mash them with a potato masher . Chop the herbs with a knife ,
combine them with the potato mixture , add salt and pepper, a bit of grated nutmeg , mix everything, and set aside the ready filling. Now focus on cleaning the sea bass: after washing it thoroughly, scale it from tail to head with a scaler or a sharp knife,
then with a pair of scissors make a cut on the belly and remove the sea bass's innards . Rinse under running water to remove residues and blood parts.
With a sharp knife, score deeply along the backbone , starting from the head. Remove the head , then separate the fillet from the backbone, turn the fish over and repeat the same operation .
Then remove the central bone from the flesh and use tweezers to remove any remaining bones . Finally, remove the skin from the sea bass with a very thin knife ,
then cut it into cubes and set aside. Now roll out the pasta with a pasta machine, proceeding from the smallest number to the desired thickness , then once rolled out, fill a piping bag with the filling and spread it gradually over the pasta ,
along with the sea bass cubes , then brush the edges of the pasta with water and place another layer of pasta on top to make the ravioli , trying to remove the air inside.
Then cut the ravioli with a wheel and, once finished, place them on a tray over a kitchen towel and dust them with flour. Then focus on the sauce: wash the cherry tomatoes, cut them in half and cook them in a pan with oil and garlic , salt them, add the basil leaves , and let cook for about 10 minutes.
Cook the ravioli in salted water and when they are cooked, transfer them gradually to the pan and toss them with the sauce. Your fish ravioli with cherry tomatoes are ready to be served hot and enjoyed to the last bite !
It's advisable to consume the fish ravioli with cherry tomatoes as soon as they are prepared, alternatively, they can be stored for a day covered in the refrigerator. If you have used all fresh ingredients, you can freeze your ravioli raw.
If you don't have much time available for cleaning the sea bass, which requires a somewhat intricate process, you can buy pre-filleted sea bass.
