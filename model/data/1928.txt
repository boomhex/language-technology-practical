instructions:
To prepare the lemon cake, first peel the lemons: remove the peel with a smooth-edged knife, making sure to also remove the more bitter white part , then cut the whole pulp in half and drag the knife over the cutting board to separate the pulp from the white membranes : you will need a total of 170 g of lemon pulp.
Preheat the oven to 350°F in static mode, and combine all the ingredients in a mixer with blades: add the instant baking powder, sugar , flour , and lemon pulp .
Also add the vegetable oil , whole milk , and whole eggs ,
then blend everything until you obtain a smooth and uniform mixture . Now take a 7.87-inch springform pan and butter it carefully , then flour it .
Pour the batter inside and bake in the preheated static oven at 350°F for about 60 minutes, placing it on the lower rack. Once baked (always perform the toothpick test at the end of cooking), remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the mold , then unmold it and dust it with powdered sugar. Your fragrant lemon cake is ready to be enjoyed !
The lemon cake can be stored outside the refrigerator, covered with a glass dome or plastic wrap, for about 2-3 days. You can also freeze it, perhaps already sliced.
We have made the pan d'arancio and the lemon cake, but we haven't tried the grapefruit version yet... experiment with this variant following the same recipe and let us know if you liked it!
