Preheat the oven to 400°F. Wash the bones thoroughly and let them drain, then place them in a large baking dish and bake for a few minutes, so that the fat melts and can be easily removed. In the meantime, clean and wash onions, carrots, and celery, and cut them into a coarse dice. Remove the bones from the oven and place them in a large pot with the oil and meat scraps, and let everything brown over high heat; when the ingredients are well browned, add the diced vegetables and the garlic, and let them brown as well. If there is an excess of fat at the bottom of the pot, remove it with a spoon, and then deglaze the ingredients with red (or white) wine, taking care to scrape any residues attached to the bottom of the pot. At this point, you can add the tomato paste and mix well; then add the water and subsequently all the herbs, and cook for 2-3 hours over low heat. Once the cooking time is over, let it cool slightly and then strain everything.
Instead of tomato paste, you can use 3.5 oz of fresh or peeled tomatoes.
