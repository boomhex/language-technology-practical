instructions:
To prepare the eggs en cocotte, start by buttering a cocotte with a diameter of 3.5 inches . Salt and pour in the room-temperature eggs, one at a time, previously cracked into a bowl or a saucer .
Place the cocotte in a pot with water almost at boiling point, reaching halfway up the mold , and cook in a bain-marie allowing the water to boil for about 10 minutes . This is how you cook eggs en cocotte. Serve them as desired with a pinch of black pepper .
It is recommended to consume eggs en cocotte immediately.
As per the traditional recipe, you can substitute butter with cream and stovetop cooking with baking.
You can add meats, fish, and vegetables—preferably cut into small pieces and precooked—before adding the egg and finishing the cooking.
If you wish to add cheeses, preferably grated or shredded, add them right away with the eggs.
