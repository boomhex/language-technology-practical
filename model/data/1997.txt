So here's the deal, this coconut chocolate cake is a treat you really, really have to try. Originating in Italy, these small tartlets called tortine Coccochoc blend rich chocolate with sweet coconut —and you know what? It's something special. Made with a coconut shortcrust pastry that's butter-free and gluten-free, it’s perfect for those with sensitivities or anyone wanting a lighter option.
Thing is, the crust is crispy and holds a super moist dark chocolate ganache filling, especially nice with a hint of cognac. Not into booze? No problem—just swap it for some orange zest. Honestly, it still works great. The tender coconut crust and deep chocolate flavor make these cakes feel special. And you know, they're pretty simple.
Compared to the usual coconut chocolate layer cake , this Italian twist is more interesting and way, way more fun. In places like Lombardy or Calabria, families add their own flair—sometimes a thicker layer of sweet ganache or toasted coconut on top for crunch. And the sauce? It's divine.
These tartlets are a hit as a snack or a quick dessert. They are the right size: not too heavy but full of flavor. The coconut shell and silky chocolate filling mean every bite is both a little crisp and super rich. Even those who prefer a big coconut chocolate pound cake end up loving these minis. Seriously, cannot go wrong.
Whether you’re whipping up a batch for a party or just craving a treat, this easy coconut chocolate cake recipe delivers all the flavor in a neat package. There's something about that golden shell and soft center—really keeps people coming back. And look, it’s hard to mess up such an awesome Italian combo. Really, it’s a win.
To prepare the coccochoc cakes, start by making the coconut shortcrust pastry. In a bowl, pour the shredded coconut, powdered sugar , and the lightly beaten eggs . Work the mixture with your hands ,
kneading quickly with your fingertips until you get a homogeneous mixture . At this point, grease 6 molds with a diameter of 2.75 inches .
Take about 1.75 oz of dough and place it inside the mold. Then gently pressing with your fingers cover the entire surface .
Repeat the same operation for the other 5 molds, then place them on a tray and put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 356°F in static mode and prepare the parchment paper circles that will be used for baking the cakes. Using a 4-inch pastry cutter as a model, draw your circles following the entire circumference , then cut them with scissors .
After 15 minutes, take the cakes out of the freezer and place a circle of paper and a handful of ceramic spheres or dried legumes on each mold: these will be used for blind baking. Gradually place the cakes on a baking sheet and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 20 minutes. Once they are nicely golden, take them out of the oven , remove the parchment paper along with the ceramic spheres, and continue baking for another 5 minutes. When the base is well-golden, remove the molds from the oven and let cool completely.
Start preparing the chocolate ganache to fill the cakes. Finely chop the dark chocolate and transfer it into a bowl; meanwhile, heat the cream in a saucepan and as soon as it reaches a boil, turn off the heat. Pour about half of it into the chocolate
and quickly stir with a spatula . Heat the remaining cream again, add it to the chocolate , and continue to stir with a whisk until the chocolate is completely melted and you have obtained a smooth mixture ; it is important that the cream is very hot.
Add the soft butter in pieces and stir until it melts. Add the liquor and stir once more .
At this point, the cakes will be cold, remove them from the molds and place them on a wire rack . Using a spoon, transfer the ganache into the shells .
Let the ganache solidify inside the cakes , placing them in the refrigerator for at least an hour before decorating with shredded coconut; to get a more precise pattern, turn one of the molds upside down and use it to ensure that the coconut only goes on the part you want to decorate . All that's left is to serve your coccochoc cakes !
The coccochoc cakes can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Alternatively, it is possible to freeze only the shells for up to 1 month.
Flavor the ganache with a pinch of nutmeg for an extra touch!
Do not replace the shredded coconut with coconut flour, you would get a dough that is too compact and the result would not be the same.
