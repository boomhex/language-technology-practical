instructions:
To prepare a good meringue, you need to use egg whites at room temperature. Then proceed by extracting the seeds from inside the vanilla pod and adding them to the sugar. Put the egg white in the bowl of a mixer (or you can use a blender's whisks) and whip until stiff; when the egg white starts to turn white, add half of the sugar, beat for another 5-10 minutes, and then add the remaining sugar . When the meringue has quintupled in its initial volume, transfer it to a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle. Take a baking sheet and line it with parchment paper, and then form the nests, which should have a diameter of about 1.5-2 inches, by creating spirals with the piping bag (2-3).
We will bake the nests formed like this at 175-210 Fahrenheit for about 3 hours, leaving the oven door slightly open by placing a wooden spoon between the door and the oven to prevent humidity from forming inside. Then proceed to whip the cream using a food processor : when the cream begins to form peaks, add the powdered sugar. Then, still using the piping bag, fill the meringue nests with the whipped cream and finally add the berries and complete your beautiful meringue nests with a dusting of powdered sugar .
