1/4 cup of pine nuts and the salt . Add the grated lemon zest and mix.
Gradually pour this mix into the whipped egg whites , stirring gently to prevent the mixture from deflating .
Take a baking sheet lined with parchment paper; take a teaspoon of dough at a time , and with another spoon, help distribute it on the baking sheet, spacing each heap a few inches apart .
With this dough, you will get about 22 cookies. Sprinkle them with the remaining pine nuts . Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes, on the middle rack. Once ready , let them cool on a rack before serving your rascals .
The rascals can be stored in a tin box for about 2-3 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer a more pronounced cinnamon note, you can sprinkle the cookies once baked and cooled.
