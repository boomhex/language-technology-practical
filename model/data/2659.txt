instructions:
Apricot yeast cake from Piedmont is really the kind of bold and moist treat that, I gotta say, stands out at the table. You know, especially when you're craving something with a little twist. What makes this apricot moscato bread different? Well, the moscato wine just sinks right into the dough and the filling, giving everything a fragrant and slightly tangy vibe. People in Piedmont have this knack for mixing fruit and wine in their desserts—seriously good—and this cake is a perfect example.
You get juicy chunks of apricot and little bursts of raisin throughout the ring. And listen, the dough? It becomes so light and tender from the slow rise. It's both pretty rich and kinda delicate, making it great with coffee in the afternoon or as a showy breakfast when guests are over. Plus, it looks so cool in that ring shape—like you went out of your way—even though it's really just the yeast and the wine doing their magic. This is what makes the moscato dessert recipe from Piedmont special!
Whenever folks around Piedmont bake this apricot yeast cake , the house fills up with that sweet, golden smell that makes everyone ask what's in the oven. And here's the thing: the moscato isn't just for aroma. It gives the whole thing this nice, grown-up flavor. But the cake stays soft and sweet thanks to the fruit. Some families even toss in extra raisins or swap in dried apricots when they're in the mood for a chunkier bite. And there's always pride in getting that rise just right. You want the crumb to be fluffy but still sturdy enough to slice.
Compared to a regular apricot brioche , this version is deeper and more aromatic. The wine and fruit work together in every bite. Whether you call it an apricot wine cake or just a yeast-raised apricot ring, it's the kind of dessert that shows up for holidays, birthdays, or just a Sunday when you want something special. Each piece is rich enough to feel like a treat but not so heavy you can't sneak a second slice. For real, this is what Piedmont's baking is all about!
To prepare the risen crown with apricots and moscato, start with the starter dough, the base that will help strengthen the leavening of the dough. In a bowl, sift the flour, add the dry yeast and gradually the water , mix everything with a spoon to gather the ingredients . (You can also use fresh yeast, in which case the amount to use is 12 g).
Then continue by hand on the work surface to obtain a nice smooth mixture; place it in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap . Let it rise for 1 hour in a turned-off oven with the light on or in a warm environment. Meanwhile, focus on the filling: wash the raisins and soak them in about 1.35 oz of moscato syrup (taken from the total dose of approximately 7 oz) to rehydrate and flavor them, also add the seeds of a vanilla pod and a tablespoon of honey , let everything macerate for about 1 hour.
In a stand mixer equipped with a whisk, pour the remaining dose of moscato syrup, the sugar , the egg yolks , and the salt , beat everything to obtain a frothy and fluffy mixture.
Replace the whisk with the paddle attachment and add the sifted flour and the starter , mix everything for a few minutes. Once combined, remove the paddle and attach the dough hook, then add the room temperature butter one piece at a time , waiting to add the next piece until the previous one is absorbed.
When the dough is well combined with the hook and is smooth and elastic, transfer it to a large bowl, cover it with plastic wrap , and let it rise for 2 hours in a turned-off oven with the light on. Take the risen dough , roll it out into a rectangle about 1/8 inch thick measuring approximately 15 x 21 inches. You can butter the work surface if necessary, so the dough doesn't stick. Brush the sheet with apricot jam leaving about 1/2 inch from the edge .
Sprinkle the surface with the raisins and roll up the sheet from the longer side (17-18). Place the seam underneath.
Cut the cylinder obtained lengthwise to create two strands, twist them around each other keeping the open side facing up, then close them to form a ring .
Take the apricots in moscato syrup: cut them in half, remove the pit, divide them into quarters , then transfer the crown onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and place a round mold for creme caramel or baba in the center made of rigid aluminum (suitable for baking) to help maintain its ring shape during baking; place the quartered apricots between the folds of the crown all around the perimeter . Gently cover with plastic wrap and let rise again for another hour in a turned-off oven with the light on. Once the final rise is complete, add the sliced almonds on top, and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 40-45 minutes (or in a convection oven at 320°F for 35-40 minutes). Remove your risen crown with apricots and moscato and let it cool slightly before serving.
Store the risen crown with apricots and moscato under a glass dome for up to 2-3 days.
If you use chunky jam, pass it through a sieve first to make it smoother.
