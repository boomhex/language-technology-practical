Dessert cioccolato birra e fragole is about taking familiar flavors and giving them this wild twist. Really cool. So, in this chocolate beer dessert , you've got the unexpected addition of high-quality beer—it's a game-changer. The beer’s aroma mixes with the deep, rich chocolate, making every bite a little bolder than you’d expect from a regular sweet treat. And the sauce? It's the beer blended into the main part and the velvety caramel sauce drizzled over the top.
The result is this kind of beer-infused dessert that feels both classic and new. You'd probably find something like it in a hip spot in Northern Italy, where folks aren't afraid to experiment with sweets. Plus, the final touch—fresh, juicy strawberries right on top—makes everything look super inviting and adds a bright, fruity bite that's hard to resist.
It's not every day you run into a strawberry chocolate dessert pulling flavors from beer. But here? It really, really works. The smooth chocolate blends with the beer's slightly bitter, almost coffee-like notes. Then you've got those strawberries bringing in just the right amount of sweetness and color. So tasty. It's a fun switch from the usual chocolate stout cake or chocolate-covered strawberries, showing how Italian kitchens get creative—without losing that hard-to-resist, homey feeling.
Folks into chocolate beer recipes or curious about beer and chocolate pairing will find this super interesting. For sure. Especially because it balances all those flavors without being too heavy. The strawberries on top not only make it look awesome but also help lighten up the rich, moist texture underneath. Altogether, this dessert shows off a really cool side of Italian sweets—a little unexpected, super flavorful, and just the thing if you want something different after dinner. Perfect for impressing guests or enjoying a cozy night in with a special twist. Can't go wrong.
To prepare the chocolate beer and strawberry dessert, start by grinding the amaretti in a mixer , transfer them to a bowl and add the sifted unsweetened cocoa powder , mixing all the powders well together. Whisk the egg yolks together with the sugar using a stand mixer or electric whisk until you obtain a creamy and light mixture.
Add the beer , then the cocoa and amaretti powder , continuing to mix with the electric whisk, and finally the milk . Continue mixing to blend all the ingredients well: the mixture should be quite liquid.
Now proceed to prepare the caramel: in a saucepan, pour the sugar and the beer . Cook until the sugar is completely dissolved .
Prepare six aluminum panna cotta molds (with a capacity of about 4.4 oz, 3.15 inches in diameter and 2.36 inches in height) and pour a bit of caramel on the bottom of each one , trying to make it adhere well to the sides as well. Prepare a baking tray large enough to hold all the molds and fill it halfway with water .
Pour the dessert mixture into the molds with the help of a ladle , arrange them in the tray and bake in the oven for 45-50 minutes at 356°F. Cut the strawberries as you prefer for the final decoration of the dessert. Once cooled, unmold, and your chocolate beer and strawberry dessert will be ready to be enjoyed.
