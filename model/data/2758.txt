instructions:
To make the fried caprese, start with the batter: separate the egg white from the yolk, beat the latter with a pinch of salt using electric whisks, slowly pour in the milk while continuing to whisk, then gradually add the sifted flour while continuously whisking to obtain a smooth mixture. Separately, beat the egg white until stiff and then gently fold it into the mixture with a spatula to avoid deflating it .
The batter is ready , set it aside covered with plastic wrap. Meanwhile, wash and cut the tomatoes into slices about 1/4 inch thick, pairing slices of the same diameter that will be overlapped. Drain the mozzarella, slice it trying to obtain slices the same width as the tomatoes . Then transfer the tomato slices to a tray, fill half with mozzarella, oregano, and basil leaves ,
then cover with another slice of tomato to create a sort of sandwich . In a high-sided pot, heat the seed oil for frying, for optimal cooking the oil should be about 340°F. Now take each caprese, dip it first in the batter to coat it completely (8-9)
and then, using a slotted spoon, place it in the oil to fry. When the batter is golden and crispy, use a slotted spoon to drain the caprese and place them on a tray covered with absorbent paper to remove excess oil . Enjoy the fried caprese hot !
It is recommended to consume the fried caprese hot and neither refrigeration nor freezing is advised.
With leftover slices of tomato and mozzarella, you can make tasty mixed salads to accompany the fried caprese!
