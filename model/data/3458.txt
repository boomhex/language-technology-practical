To prepare the zucchini crepe roll, start by washing, trimming, and grating the zucchini with a coarse grater ; then squeeze them well using a strainer and collect them in a bowl. Then add the Philadelphia cheese and the bechamel sauce that you've prepared with the doses indicated above and following the procedure you can find Béchamel sauce
Add the Emmental cheese and half of the Grana Padano , and finally the egg ; then mix and adjust with salt and pepper. Prepare 6 crepes using the ingredients listed above and following the procedure you can find Sweet and savory crepes (Basic recipe) .
On a sheet of buttered parchment paper, arrange the crepes, slightly overlapping them to form a rectangle , spread the zucchini and Philadelphia mixture in the center of the rectangle , and roll the crepes up using the parchment paper as a guide
Close the roll like a candy, twisting the ends of the paper , and bake it in the oven at 356°F for about 30 minutes. Then open the paper, sprinkle the roll with the remaining Grana Padano and some knobs of butter, and broil for another 5 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the basil cream in this way: place 2 tablespoons of Philadelphia with a few basil leaves , two tablespoons of milk, Grana Padano, and a pinch of freshly ground pepper in a small saucepan over a bain-marie, remove from the heat as soon as the sauce is warm. Serve the zucchini crepe roll in slices, drizzling with basil cream!
