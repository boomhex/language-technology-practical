To prepare the pine nut creme caramel, start by pouring the condensed milk into a large bowl . Then add the fresh milk and the fresh cream , and mix with a whisk to combine.
Continue by adding the pine nut paste , mix, and finally add the eggs . If you can't find pine nut paste, you can achieve a similar result by blending the same amount of pine nuts in a mixer with a splash of milk. At this point, blend everything with an immersion blender until the mixture is smooth.
Focus on preparing the caramel sauce: first, heat the water in a saucepan until it boils. In another thick-bottomed steel saucepan, pour the sugar and let it cook over medium heat until the sugar has melted. The double bottom allows the heat to spread evenly, preventing the sugar from burning. Then add the boiling water and cook for about 1 minute , then form a layer of caramel at the bottom of each mold and rotate it to fill it evenly. To learn how to best prepare caramel and other variations, check out our Cooking School: Caramel .
Then fill the molds to the brim with the mixture , and place them in a baking dish, pouring boiling water inside up to 2/3 of the height of the molds . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 40 minutes, until the surface is slightly toasted .
Once cooked, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely in the same dish in which they were baked, then place them in the refrigerator to set for at least 3 hours. After this time, take them out of the refrigerator and, to unmold them more easily, dip them in boiling water for a few seconds and invert them onto a serving plate . Finish your dessert by sprinkling the surface with coarsely chopped pine nuts . All that's left is to serve your pine nut creme caramel and delight your guests!
You can store the pine nut creme caramel in the fridge, well covered with plastic wrap, for at least 4 days.
