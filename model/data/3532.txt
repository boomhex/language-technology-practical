Separate the celery stalks from the leaves , remove the fibrous elements , and cut them into pieces about 2 inches long .
Using a peeler, cut the stalks into strips following the long side . Finally, immerse them in ice water to make them crispy . Cut similar strips from the washed and dried Iceberg lettuce and place them in a bowl ; wash the celery leaves thoroughly and chop them finely as if they were parsley.
Roast the two peppers in the oven until tender ; don't worry if the outer skin slightly burns. Peel the roasted peppers and cut them into strips about half an inch wide and 2 inches long . Place the strips in a bowl, lightly salt them, and let them rest for 30 minutes . This process will help remove excess water from the peppers, which should be saved for the dressing.
Start preparing the dressing by collecting the peppers' vegetable water with a strainer . Put it in a blender and add the same amount of oil and white wine vinegar . Also, add the two teaspoons of mustard and the teaspoon of honey and blend well , adding a little warm water if the consistency becomes too creamy. Finally, adjust with salt and pepper.
Pour the dressing into a small bowl and set it aside . Mix the strips of lettuce and celery in a salad bowl , season with part of the dressing, and mix well .
Finally, brush the 8 slices of bread with some oil and put them in the oven to toast. When the bread is well toasted, lightly rub the garlic clove on the slices that will accompany the salad . Plate the salad and add the pepper fillets ,
the green olives , the chopped celery leaves , and put the remaining dressing on top . Serve the celery and pepper salad with the toasted bread bruschetta .
