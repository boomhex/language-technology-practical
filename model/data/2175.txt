instructions:
To prepare the pasta with fennel, start by preparing the confit cherry tomatoes. Wash the cherry tomatoes, cut them in half , and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, positioning them cut side up. Salt, pepper, and sprinkle them first with brown sugar , then oregano and oil . Cook in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 50 minutes and in the meantime, work on making the pesto.
Wash the fennel as well, pat it dry with a paper towel, and take only the leaves, removing the stem . Then, transfer them to a blender, add the peeled almonds , grated cheese, a pinch of salt , and pepper.
Finally, pour in the oil and blend everything until you get a homogeneous mixture . At this point, place a pot filled with water on the stove (which will be used for cooking the pasta) and bring it to just below boiling, then salt it. Transfer the fennel pesto into a large pan (this will make it easier to dress the pasta), without turning on the heat. Dilute it with a ladle of hot water .
At this point, the confit cherry tomatoes will be ready, remove them from the oven , cook the pasta , and drain it al dente. Transfer them to the pan where you poured the fennel pesto .
Add the confit cherry tomatoes , mix everything briefly , and serve your pasta with fennel !
Store the pasta with fennel pesto in the refrigerator for a maximum of one day. Freezing is not recommended.
For an even fresher note, add some stracciatella, always away from the heat!
