Mescafrancesca with potatoes and fish is like a taste of Campania magic, especially from Naples. It is hearty pasta dishes and fresh seafood at their best. This modern mescafrancesca recipe ? Well, it takes its cue from the classic Neapolitan pasta mista. You start with a creamy base—kind of like pasta e patate—but, here's the thing, with a twist from the sea. You know, in Naples, mixing different pasta shapes is a big deal, and this one pushes boundaries with tender octopus, sweet shrimp, little clams, and delicate raw sea bass. It gently cooks from the heat of the pasta, keeping the fish moist and flavorful.
What truly makes this mescafrancesca with potatoes and fish stand out is the candied lemon. It brings a sweet and slightly tangy note—perfectly complementing those rich potatoes and the Italian seafood pasta vibe. Throughout Campania, especially Naples, getting creative with seafood and pasta? It's a way of life. And Chef Roberto Di Pinto’s version shows how to mix traditional roots with something new. This mescafrancesca pasta dish is like having two Neapolitan favorites in one, all enhanced with vibrant colors and flavors from the ocean.
Plus, it makes any meal feel special—everything from the soft, golden potatoes to the mix of shellfish and fish gives you a real taste of Italian coastal life. The candied lemon surprises with a burst of fresh flavor that lifts the whole dish. This isn't just another traditional Italian recipe ; it looks great, tastes rich, and feels modern while staying true to Campania’s culinary roots.

To prepare the mescafrancesca potatoes and fish, start with the octopus: bring a pot of water to a boil to which you have added coarsely chopped carrot, celery, and onion, then submerge the octopus and cook for 40 minutes.

In the meantime, take care of the shellfish: clean the mussels and clams (for more information, you can refer to our guides " How to Clean and Open Mussels " and " How to clean clams "). In a large pan, flavor the oil with parsley stems and a clove of garlic , then add the mussels and clams . Pour in a little water and cook on high heat, shaking the pan frequently.
As the shells open, remove the shellfish with tongs and set them aside. Once they have all opened, strain the cooking liquid through a chinois . At this point, shell the mussels and clams and keep the mollusks in the strained cooking liquid .
Move on to cleaning the other fish: remove the skin from the sea bass fillet and cut it first into strips and then into cubes .
Clean the squid (for more information, you can refer to the guide "How to Clean Squid"). Cut the squid mantle lengthwise to open it , then scrape the inside with the back of a knife to clean it and remove the thin skin . Cut the squid into strips and then into regular pieces .
Clean the shrimp (for more information, you can refer to the guide " How to clean shrimp ") and cut the flesh into pieces of the same size . Finally, cut 100 g of cooked octopus into pieces . Transfer the sea bass, squid, shrimp, and octopus to a bowl, then add the shelled mussels and clams with their liquid .
Finely chop the candied lemon and add it to the bowl with the fish and shellfish , then also season with the fennel and basil cut into julienne strips . Finally, dress with lemon juice and a drizzle of oil, mix well, and set aside.
Now focus on the potatoes: peel them and cut them first into slices and then into sticks . Cut the central sticks into cubes of more regular shape , and mince the side parts instead .
Peel and dice the carrots , celery , and onion into brunoise.
You can now proceed with cooking: heat the oil in a large saucepan, then add the vegetables for the sauté and brown over low heat for about ten minutes. At this point, add the potatoes to the sauté and salt .
Pour in the fish stock and shellfish stock and cook over medium heat for about 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the mixed pasta for about 4 minutes .
Drain the pasta, transfer it to the saucepan , and cook for about another 5 minutes . When the pasta is al dente and the potatoes are soft and creamy, turn off the heat and wait for the boil to subside, then add all the fish .
