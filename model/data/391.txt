instructions:
To prepare the microwave vegetable minestrone, first wash and dry the vegetables. Remove the pumpkin skin . Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and internal filaments . Then slice it into evenly thick slices and then into cubes about 1/2 inch on each side .
Trim the zucchini, slice them, and then cut them into cubes the same size as the pumpkin . Cut the cauliflower in half , remove the central core and separate the florets .
Remove the outer part of the leek and cut it into thin rings . Peel the potatoes , cut them into thick slices, and then into cubes .
Also, slice the tomatoes first and then dice them . Finely chop the onion .
Dice the celery , peel the carrots and cut them into strips and then into dice . Tie a sprig of rosemary and bay leaves with kitchen string to form an aromatic bundle .
In a large Pyrex bowl, place the onions, carrots, and celery, add the leeks and the aromatic bundle . Add the pumpkin and the cauliflower .
Add the zucchini, potatoes, tomatoes , borlotti beans , and peas .
Pour in the oil , season with salt and pepper .
Mix everything well , then pour in the water . Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave at 800 W for 12 minutes.
Remove the aromatic bundle and drizzle with a little oil . The microwave vegetable minestrone is ready to be served .
You can store the microwave vegetable minestrone in the fridge, in a closed container, for about 2-3 days. It can be frozen if only fresh ingredients have been used.
Cutting the vegetables into similarly sized cubes will ensure even cooking. You can enrich the minestrone with croutons and grated cheese. Preparing the minestrone is a great idea for recycling leftover vegetables.
