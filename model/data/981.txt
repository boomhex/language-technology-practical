instructions:
To make the stuffed champignon mushrooms with sausage, first clean the mushrooms: cut off the earthy base of the stem . If very dirty, you can rinse them quickly (be careful because mushrooms absorb water easily, which can ruin them) and dry them well but gently with a cloth to remove all soil residues.
Detach the stems carefully, without breaking or snapping the mushroom cap , and keep them separate . Chop the provolone cheese .
Remove the casing from the sausage and finely chop the meat . Also chop the reserved mushroom stems .

Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan with a peeled garlic clove , when the oil is hot add the sausage and let it brown for 3-4 minutes, then add the mushroom stems , season with salt and pepper.
Season with chopped rosemary and cook for another 2 minutes over high heat. Turn off the heat, remove the garlic , and add the mild provolone cheese .
Stir to combine the flavors; the filling is ready . Oil and salt the champignon caps previously placed on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , stuff them with the sausage and provolone filling .
Finally, sprinkle grated cheese on top . Bake in a preheated static oven at 400°F for 20 minutes. Switch to grill mode for the last 5 minutes to gratin. Remove the stuffed champignon mushrooms with sausage from the oven , let them cool slightly, and then serve .
Store the stuffed champignon caps in the refrigerator for 1-2 days after cooking. We do not recommend freezing.
Select champignon mushrooms with large and domed caps so that they can be easily stuffed.
