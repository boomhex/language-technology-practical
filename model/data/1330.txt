instructions:
To make the garlic-free pesto, first wash and dry the basil leaves well (you can also just clean them with a dry cloth to prevent them from wilting or oxidizing), then transfer them to a tall glass and add the pine nuts , the grated Parmigiano and Pecorino . Also pour in the olive oil and a pinch of salt.
Blend the mixture with an immersion blender until you get a smooth and fluid sauce . The garlic-free pesto is ready to be used in your dishes .
Store the freshly made pesto in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for 2-3 days, making sure to cover the sauce with a layer of oil. It is possible to freeze the pesto in small jars and then thaw it in the refrigerator or at room temperature.
To add a creative touch to the pesto, try adding sun-dried tomatoes, Taggiasca olives, or half a zucchini!
