Plus, it’s a great way to explore how the Swiss Alps' culinary traditions use local, rustic ingredients to create something really special and satisfying. And the sauce? Can't go wrong.
To prepare the herb dumplings stuffed with Sbrinz, wash the potatoes and boil them whole with the skin in lightly salted water . Meanwhile, grate 150g of cheese and cut 50g into small cubes. Finely chop the aromatic herbs together .
While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the Sbrinz sauce that will be used to season the dumplings: heat the milk (or cream) in a small pot and add the Sbrinz . Melt everything and sprinkle in the flour , then wait for the sauce to thicken and add the pepper, nutmeg . Adjust the salt if necessary and set aside.
Drain the potatoes when they are cooked and let them cool for 5 minutes, then peel and mash them with a food mill. Place the obtained purée on a work surface where you have spread half of the total flour, and add about 0.35 oz of chopped aromatic herbs and salt . Cover with the rest of the flour and knead until you form a homogeneous dough .
Shape the dough into logs and cut them into cubes , filling each one with a small piece of Sbrinz and then roll them on a ridged board to give the traditional shape to the dumplings (alternatively, you can use the prongs of a fork). Drop the dumplings (one portion at a time) into plenty of boiling salted water .
Reheat the Sbrinz sauce and add the other chopped aromatic herbs , about a tablespoon, but you can increase or decrease the amount according to your taste. When they float to the surface, drain them and place them directly in the pan with the Sbrinz sauce . Your herb dumplings stuffed with Sbrinz are ready!
The freshly shaped dumplings can be frozen by placing them on a tray for half an hour, well spaced, and then once they are hard, they can be put together in a bag. You can store the cooked and seasoned dumplings for a couple of days in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
As an alternative to parsley, thyme, and chives, any herb will do: even marjoram or rosemary, for example. You can complete the dish with some curls of Sbrinz, or gratin the dumplings under the grill for a few minutes, of course, only after sprinkling them with plenty of grated Sbrinz!
