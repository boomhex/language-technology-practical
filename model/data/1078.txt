instructions:
To prepare the egg white shortcrust pastry, pour the flour and sugar into a large bowl , then create a well in the center and add the cold cubed butter .
Add the baking soda and grated lemon zest , then start working with your fingers to obtain a crumbly mixture. Finally, add the egg whites at room temperature .
Continue to knead quickly in the bowl to mix all the ingredients , then transfer the mixture to the work surface and continue kneading quickly to obtain a smooth dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to rest for at least half an hour. After the resting time, your egg white shortcrust pastry is ready to be rolled out and used for many recipes !
The egg white shortcrust pastry can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days wrapped in plastic wrap.
You can freeze the egg white shortcrust dough for up to one month.
Instead of lemon zest, you can use orange zest or the seeds from a vanilla bean to flavor your egg white shortcrust pastry.
If you prefer a more crumbly texture, you can replace the baking soda with a pinch of baking powder, as in our Soft Shortcrust Pastry recipe!
