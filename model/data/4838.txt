To prepare the white chocolate glaze, first finely chop the chocolate . Then soak the gelatin in cold water. In a saucepan, pour the cream and the glucose . Heat everything until it is about to boil.
Turn off the heat and add the chocolate , stirring until it melts . Drain the gelatin
and transfer it into the saucepan, then stir until completely dissolved . Pour the mixture into a bowl and blend everything with an immersion blender .
Cover the glaze with plastic wrap touching the surface , let it cool slightly, and place it in the fridge until it is completely cold. When ready to use, stir with a spatula and use the white chocolate glaze to garnish your desserts .
It can be stored in the fridge for 3-4 days.
To achieve a well-glazed cake, we recommend glazing it while it's on a rack. Wait a few minutes, collect the excess glaze that drips below the rack, and use it for a second coating.
