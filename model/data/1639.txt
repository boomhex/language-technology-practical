instructions:
To make the Caprese tartlets, first prepare the pastry bases: roll out the sheet of puff pastry and cut 6 circles using a pastry cutter with a diameter of 4.75 inches , then remove the excess pastry . Butter 6 tartlet molds of the same diameter
and place the puff pastry circles inside, pressing the edges well , then prick the base with a fork . Place a rectangle of parchment paper on each tartlet, cover it with baking spheres (alternatively you can use dried legumes) and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 15 minutes. After this time, remove the parchment paper and spheres and continue baking for another 7-8 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the ingredients to fill the tartlets: wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them in half , then cut the mozzarella balls in half and finally into quarters .
After the baking time, take the tartlets out of the oven , let them cool slightly and remove them from the molds. At this point, you can fill the tartlets by arranging the cherry tomatoes alternated with the mozzarella balls on the surface . Season with a pinch of salt ,
a drizzle of oil , a basil leaf, and a pinch of oregano and proceed in the same way with all the others: your Caprese tartlets are ready to be served !
We recommend enjoying the Caprese tartlets as soon as they are ready.
Once the pastry bases are made, you can customize the Caprese tartlets with your favorite ingredients such as olives, capers, sun-dried tomatoes, anchovies… let your imagination guide you!
