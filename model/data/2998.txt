Sushi all'italiana is a super fun twist on traditional sushi—mixing it with Mediterranean flair. The idea here is pretty simple: swap out the usual nori for big, tender chard leaves. These wrap around sticky sushi rice and very fresh salmon. And you know what? It still looks like a classic sushi roll but with a greener vibe, which is great, right? Plus, the chard gives it a fresh, slightly earthy flavor that works really really well with the fish. It just pops on the plate!
And listen, instead of just copying Japanese sushi, this dish uses local ingredients, making it unique. It's a hit as a sushi fusion italiano appetizer when you want to impress friends—no question. Everyone loves those crispy edges on the chard; makes the whole roll feel light. Yet, you get that satisfying sushi bite.
Thing is, safety is a big deal here, so the fish is always properly frozen before serving. To be honest, freezing salmon at -18°C for at least 96 hours makes sure it's safe to eat. This way, you enjoy the fresh, tangy flavors of salmon without worrying. Often, it’s served with sides like soy sauce or pickled ginger—giving you a hint of Japanese flair with a local twist. Some adventurous folks? Yeah, they add prosciutto, mozzarella, or basil inside the rolls, really pushing that ricette sushi all'italiana vibe.
Honestly, however you serve it, this sushi mediterraneo blends the soft, sweet taste of rice with fresh ingredients. It looks super fancy but feels inviting and chill. Pretty much a super cool way to show off some fusion cooking at your next dinner or party. With this dish, you’re not just offering sushi; you’re sharing a delicious cross-cultural experience, bringing together the best of both worlds. Seriously, it’s a win-win.
To prepare Italian-style sushi, start by preparing the rice (you can consult the detailed procedure in the Homemade Sushi card): we used 1 cup of raw rice (small and round grains) which will double in weight once cooked. Rinse the rice under cold running water : do at least ten rinses, moving the rice with your hands until the water becomes clear. Leave the rice to soak for 15 minutes, then drain it and let it rest for another 15 minutes in the colander. After this time, place the rice in a not-too-wide pot and cover it completely with water .
Cover the rice with a lid , cook over medium heat to bring to a boil. Do not open the lid until you hear boiling. At that point, boil for 8-10 minutes, then lower the heat and cook over low heat for another 8-10 minutes. After this time, turn off the heat and let it rest with the lid on for at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the seasoning: pour the rice vinegar into a saucepan, add the sugar , the salt, and heat everything to dissolve the sugar, stirring occasionally without bringing to a boil. Turn off the heat and let cool. When the rice has rested for the indicated time, transfer it to the hangiri (or a shallow, wide container), take a wooden ladle (preferably a shamoji, a flat, rounded spatula) and, holding it over the rice, pour the now cold rice vinegar mixture over it, so that it drizzles over and is better distributed. Gently move the rice with the spatula using a cutting motion, to avoid crushing it, and fan it simultaneously with a plastic plate to cool it quickly and evaporate the vinegar. Once cooled, cover it with a clean cloth until ready to use to prevent drying out.
Then proceed to prepare the sushi: rinse under running water and dry with kitchen paper the salmon fillet, already deboned (alternatively, you can use 1.7 oz of salmon and 1.7 oz of fresh tuna). Then place it on a cutting board and cut slices about 0.4 inches thick , then divide them in half to create strips . Then rinse under running water the chard leaves one by one. Then cut off the stem .
Then remove the central rib . Take a steamer and heat the water, then add the basket. When the basket is also well-heated, place the chard leaves inside and then cover with the lid to steam the leaves for about 2-3 minutes (if you don't have a steamer, you can use a pot and replace the basket with an aluminum colander).
Turn the leaves over halfway through cooking using kitchen tongs , then turn off the heat. On a surface, place rectangles of plastic wrap, then with the warm chard leaves form squares about 7 inches on each side , placing them slightly overlapping. Then add about 1 cup of rice in the center .
Distribute the rice in the center of the leaves, creating a rectangle and leaving about 0.4 inches of space on the sides. On top of the rice, place a strip of salmon . Take the edges of the plastic wrap and lift them to fold the leaves over the filling. Then remove the wrap from the folded part, holding the leaves with your fingers .
Gently roll the leaves, rolling them over themselves , pressing the rice well and adhering the leaves to each other to obtain a compact roll .
Now gently bring the roll back to the beginning of the plastic wrap and wrap it, rolling it gradually with the latter (23-24).
Seal the plastic wrap by twisting the ends like candy and let the sushi rest in the refrigerator for 1 or 2 hours. After the indicated time, remove the plastic wrap. Before cutting the sushi, wet the knife blade with acidulated water. This is because the cooked rice is very sticky and tends to adhere. Then cut rolls of 0.8 inches in length . Store the Italian-style sushi in the refrigerator until ready to serve. You can present the Italian-style sushi on a serving plate and accompany it with soy sauce or pickled ginger!
Store Italian-style sushi in the fridge in an airtight container for a maximum of one day. Freezing is not recommended.
Classy touch: use the steamed chard stems as if they were avocado. Italian flavor, Japanese mood :) Regarding condiments, there is less choice, so we recommend sticking with Japan and serving the Italian-style sushi with soy sauce, wasabi, or pickled ginger.
Before consuming raw, marinated, or undercooked fish, it is recommended to freeze it for at least 96 hours at 0°F in a domestic freezer marked with 3 or more stars, according to the guidelines from the Ministry of Health .
