instructions:
To prepare the gratinated fennel with almonds, first clean the fennel: remove the base and tops , then remove the tougher outer leaves; cut them into wedges and wash under running water. Dice the provolone cheese ,
then chop both the parsley and the rosemary . In a bowl, add the breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper, then add the chopped herbs , the almond flakes
and the cheese cubes . Mix well to combine the breading . Place the fennel in a rectangular baking dish approximately 10x6 inches, drizzle with a little oil
and cover with the breading . Add another drizzle of oil and bake in a preheated static oven at 320°F for about 20 minutes. When the surface is nicely golden, you can remove your gratinated fennel with almonds and serve them !
The gratinated fennel with almonds can be stored in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to 2 days. It is possible to freeze them.
If you wish, you can replace the provolone with Asiago or Camembert cheese, for a creamier effect!
