Salads are the most loved dishes during the summer season. But who said they should only be for that period? Just as we created a special version for the panzanella , we also have a winter version of the salad! To make the most of all the ingredients that the earth gives us, we tempted you with the cabbage salad and today we continue the salad saga for the coldest season with the winter salad recipe. Cubes of pears, tender beets, sweet baby spinach, and crunchy walnuts join together with gorgonzola to transform into a side dish rich in flavors and colors. The winter salad is perfect to enjoy as an entree or to pair with many main courses, especially those based on meat. Customize this dish according to your taste, using seasonal fruits and vegetables!
To prepare the winter salad, start by washing the pears, then cut them into 4 wedges and using a small knife remove the core and peel. Cut the pears into chunks of about 1 inch and set them aside for a moment.
Move on to the precooked beets, cut them in half first , then into slices about 3/4 inch thick , and finally into chunks .
Place the baby spinach in a bowl, add the pears , the beets , and the walnuts, breaking them with your hands .
Being creamy, you will not be able to cut the gorgonzola into cubes, so use a spoon to break it and add it to the salad . Season with salt and dress with oil .
and balsamic vinegar . Mix everything and serve your winter salad .
It is recommended to consume the winter salad immediately.
Instead of pears, you can use apples. Additionally, you can substitute the gorgonzola with another cheese of your choice and use your favorite nuts.
