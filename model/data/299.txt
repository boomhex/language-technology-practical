instructions:
To prepare the persimmon cheesecake cups, first scoop out the soft persimmons , then peel the firm persimmons and cut them into cubes .
In a pan, melt the butter, then add the cubed firm persimmons and the powdered sugar . Sauté the cubes for 5 minutes, just enough time to lightly caramelize them . Set aside.
For the cream: in a bowl, place the cream cheese, mascarpone , powdered sugar , and heavy cream .
Blend with an electric mixer . Add the vanilla extract and mix again .
Now add the soft persimmons , mix one last time , and set aside. In a blender, place the digestive biscuits .
Add the softened butter and blend until you obtain a crumbly mixture . You are ready to assemble the dessert: take 4 glasses with a capacity of about 5.6 oz and form a layer at the base with the biscuit and butter mixture .
Continue with a layer of cream , then add the sautéed persimmons , and finally more cream until you reach the rim of the glasses.
Garnish the surface with crumbs from the biscuit and butter mixture, a few more cubes of firm persimmon , and finally almond flakes . Your persimmon cheesecake cups are ready to be served !
The persimmon cheesecake cups can be stored in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, for up to 2 days.
If you wish, you can substitute the digestive biscuits with cocoa biscuits or whole grain biscuits.
Add a pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg to the cream for a spicy touch that pairs perfectly with persimmons.
You can replace mascarpone and cream with Greek yogurt for a lighter cream.
Have fun varying the fruit to create different cheesecake cups each time!
