Phyllo pastry shrimp spinach rolls are a hit, no question. I mean, they're perfect for any gathering. With roots in Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine, these little triangles are crispy on the outside and tasty inside. Really good stuff. The combo of sweet shrimp and bitter spinach is classic, and with toasted pine nuts, it gets a nutty twist. You take ready-made phyllo sheets, cut them into rectangles, and fill them before folding into neat triangles. Keeps everything in, so they come out golden and crunchy—and they look pretty fancy.
Shrimp and spinach phyllo rolls are something else. The flavors just blend perfectly, for real. That crunchy pastry with juicy shrimp and earthy spinach? And the pine nuts add texture, making it all work so so well. They're ideal finger food. For sure. They vanish fast when friends come over. Plus, while others add cheese or herbs, this version stays simple, letting the shrimp and spinach phyllo appetizers shine. A cool yogurt dip or a zesty lemon squeeze makes them pop.
If you're into phyllo dough recipes or need easy seafood appetizers that impress, these rolls are your answer. The crispy goodness and light yet really satisfying flavor are unmatched. For anyone looking to shake things up at their next get-together, these baked phyllo rolls offer something fun and super tasty. They're versatile too, fitting right into both casual parties and formal events. Guests will love them. Really, they will. Seriously good choice.
To make the phyllo pastry rolls with shrimp and spinach, start with the preparation of the spinach: clean and wash the spinach (or get fresh spinach already washed, bagged, and ready to cook). Place a pan with a drizzle of oil and a clove of garlic (if you like) on the stove , add the spinach and let them boil over medium heat (for about 5-6 minutes) with the water retained during washing , add salt and pepper, and cover the pot with a lid. Once cooked , remove the garlic, squeeze them well
and let them drain in a colander to remove excess water . Now clean the shrimp following the directions found in the How to clean shrimp section of the Cooking School: rinse them under running water, remove the head, legs, shell , and tail. Remove the intestine: make a small incision in the shrimp's back with a toothpick and gently pull it out .
Cut the cleaned shrimp into small bites about 1/2 inch in size , place a pan with a drizzle of oil on the stove, and sear the shrimp for a few minutes .
Salt and pepper the shrimp. Toast the pine nuts in another pan, stirring often, until golden . Remove from heat and set aside. Melt the butter in a small pot, then place a phyllo pastry sheet on the work surface and brush it with the melted butter , then place another sheet of the same size on top to adhere them together.
From the pastry available (we used phyllo sheets measuring 19 inches x 9.5 inches), cut out four equal rectangles by slicing the pastry in half lengthwise and widthwise . This way, you obtain 4 rectangles measuring 4.75 inches x 9.5 inches. Place the spinach, shrimp, and pine nut mixture at the narrow base of the rectangle.
Take the bottom left corner of the rectangle and fold it halfway over the long side of the pastry rectangle to create a triangle. Continue wrapping the pastry triangle onto itself until the end of the pastry strip (16-17). You will have thus created triangular rolls , continue with the remaining phyllo pastry (with these amounts, you will get about 12 rolls).
Take a baking tray, line it with parchment paper, and gently place the rolls on it, brush them with beaten egg yolks to give a uniform golden color when baking. Sprinkle with poppy seeds and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 25 minutes (or in a fan oven at 356°F for 15-20 minutes). The phyllo pastry rolls with shrimp and spinach will be ready when they are golden on the surface, let them cool slightly , and serve them!
Once cooked, you can store the phyllo pastry rolls with shrimp and spinach in the refrigerator for a couple of days in an airtight container. Phyllo pastry is sold frozen, so it is not possible to freeze the rolls.
And as for the filling, unleash the devil! Let's do this: we give you some suggestions, and you try them and then give us some ideas :) First idea: carnivore roll. Replace the shrimp with white meat (chicken or veal), ensuring it remains tender during baking as it will need to stay in the oven for 25 minutes. Second idea: vegetarian roll. Fill the phyllo pastry with a mix of spinach, feta, and pine nuts. And you, any spontaneous ideas?
