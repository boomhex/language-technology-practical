Arrange the flour and sugar in a fountain shape, add the whole eggs, softened butter, and yeast, and knead everything very well until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough. Roll out the dough well with a rolling pin until it's reduced to a thickness of 1/16 inch, and with a pastry cutter or a wheel, cut out dough discs the size of a coffee saucer.
Soften the raisins in warm water and in the meantime chop the walnuts, almonds, figs, and dark chocolate. In a large container, pour the previously chopped ingredients, the squeezed raisins, and add the cocoa powder, spices, grated orange peels, a small glass of rum or Strega liqueur, the cooked wine (or sour cherry jam) and honey, to get a soft but consistent mixture. Brush the edges of the dough discs with egg white (to help them close), then place a little filling in the center and close them by folding the discs over themselves, forming a half-moon; press the edges well, perhaps with the help of a fork's prongs. Brush the obtained nepitelle with egg yolk, place them on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper, and bake the sweets at 392°F for about 30 minutes, until they have obtained a nice golden color. Once removed from the oven, let them cool and... Happy Easter!
When the nepitelle are cold, you can store them by closing them in a tin box (perhaps the one you use for Christmas cookies), and placing them in a cool place: they will keep perfectly for a long time.
You can use butter instead of lard; instead of cooked wine, you can use sour cherry jam.
Nepitelle are small sweets of Arab origin: the traditional production period is Easter, but they are now produced at different times of the year, and it's not rare to find variations in their filling. Often the cooked wine is replaced with sour cherry jam, and sometimes dried figs are not used: the most used liqueur is Strega, but others are also used, as long as they are sweet. The citrus peels used can be mandarins, oranges, or lemons. Even for the external dough of nepitelle, it is produced with variations: it is often prepared without eggs.
