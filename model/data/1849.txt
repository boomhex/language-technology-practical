instructions:
To prepare baked Tropea onions, first remove the root end and peel them . Then cut them lengthwise
to obtain 2 halves . Place the onions in a baking dish (also suitable for oven cooking), drizzle them with a little oil, and sear them over high heat for about 5 minutes , being careful to move them occasionally, leaving them with the cut side facing up, to prevent burning. Meanwhile, take the aromatic herbs
and chop them finely . Then, as soon as the onions are slightly seared, remove them from the heat and sprinkle them with the freshly chopped herbs. Season with coarse salt , add a drizzle of oil
and pepper . At this point , bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for about 30-35 minutes, in the middle rack. Remove from the oven and serve your baked Tropea onions with your favorite main dishes!
Store the baked Tropea onions in the refrigerator in an airtight container and consume them within a couple of days at most, reheating slightly.
Perfume your baked Tropea onions with lemon zest, and if you want them well caramelized, you can add a teaspoon of honey before baking them.
