Pennette with almond pesto and shrimp is the kind of shrimp pasta recipe that can turn an ordinary night into something really special. In Liguria , they love seafood and fresh herbs—it's legendary—and this dish gives a creative twist with a creamy almond pesto instead of the usual basil version. Really, the almonds give the sauce a rich, velvety texture that clings beautifully to the pasta. The shrimp? They add a tender, briny pop to each bite. A touch of lemon zest makes it fresh, cutting through the creamy sauce and really highlighting the seafood. Choosing 5-grain pennette gives it a modern, healthier twist, yet still keeps that comforting Italian feel. This easy shrimp pasta is quick to make but looks and tastes like it was planned days in advance.

To prepare the penne with almond pesto and shrimp, first clean the shrimp: rinse them under running water, remove the head and shell , then cut the shelled shrimp in half lengthwise and gently pull the black string inside, which is the intestine, with the tip of the knife . For further instructions, you can consult our cooking school on How to clean shrimp .
Once all the shrimp are cleaned, put a pot of water on the stove to cook the pasta and proceed with the preparation of the almond pesto: place the peeled almonds in a mixer, add the grated Grana cheese , the grated pecorino cheese , the marjoram leaves ,
the grated zest of half a lemon (be careful to take only the yellow part) , the extra virgin olive oil , salt and pepper,
then blend until you get a rather creamy consistency . At this point, the water should be boiling, so add the pasta and cook it for the time indicated on the package. Meanwhile, cook the shrimp: briefly sauté the garlic cloves in oil in a pan, then add the shrimp and sauté them for a few minutes over medium heat.
Season with salt and pepper , grate about half of the remaining lemon zest that you used for the pesto and add a ladle of pasta cooking water , then turn off the heat.
If you wish, remove the garlic cloves from the pan, then add the almond pesto to the cooked shrimp and mix everything well . Once cooked, drain the pasta and add it to the sauce in the pan , saving a couple of ladles of its cooking water.
Mix to blend the pasta well with the sauce , always with the heat off, adding another ladle of pasta cooking water if necessary. Transfer the seasoned pasta to the serving dish, add the remaining grated lemon zest and some marjoram leaves : your penne with almond pesto and shrimp are ready to be served hot!
It is recommended to serve the penne with almond pesto and shrimp immediately. The almond pesto can be stored for 3-4 days in the refrigerator, sealed in a glass jar and covered with oil, or you can freeze it.
If you don't like pecorino, you can replace it with the same amount of Grana or Parmesan. To scent the pesto, you can use thyme instead of marjoram. Finally, why not give this dish an even more sophisticated touch by replacing the shrimp with langoustines?
