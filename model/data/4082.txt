Brush all the edges with egg white and prick the base with a fork . Bake the puff pastries in a preheated convection oven at 392°F (200°C) for about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the pastry cream: place the yolks and sugar in a saucepan .
Add the sifted cornstarch and mix with a hand whisk to combine the ingredients . Slowly pour in the milk while stirring with the whisk .
Cook over low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring with the whisk , until the pastry cream begins to thicken . Remove the cream from the heat, transfer it to a dish, let it cool down, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled.
In the meantime, the puff pastries will be baked, so take them out of the oven and let them cool . You are ready to assemble the treats: fill the bases with pastry cream .
