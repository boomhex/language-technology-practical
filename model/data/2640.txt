To prepare the salmon rolls with grilled vegetables and cheese, start with the vegetables: use a mandoline to thinly slice the washed and trimmed eggplants , then do the same with the zucchinis. Then heat a cast iron grill or a non-stick pan and grill the vegetables (2-3) on both sides for a few minutes.
Take the salmon fillet and check that it doesn't have any bones, otherwise remove them with kitchen tweezers. Then cut it into 8 slices not too thin (you can have the slices prepared directly at the fish market if you do not have suitable knives). Place two slices of zucchini and one of eggplant on each slice of salmon (you can adjust the quantities based on the size of the vegetable slices);
then continue with the robiola, then roll up the slice of salmon . Continue this way until all the ingredients are used up. Heat a non-stick pan and briefly sear the salmon rolls turning them to cook on all sides .
Finally, emulsify honey with soy sauce in a small bowl (you can use wildflower or acacia honey) and use it to serve your salmon rolls with grilled vegetables and cheese .
Store the rolls in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 1 day.
Freezing is not recommended.
Buy thinly sliced salmon, so it is already ready to create the rolls. You can choose another creamy cheese to fill the rolls or a slice of smoked cheese if you prefer!
