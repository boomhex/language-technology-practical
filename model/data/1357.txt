instructions:
To make the upside-down lemon cake, first wash and dry the 3 lemons well, then cut them into slices 1/8 inch thick . In a flared pan measuring 9 inches at the edge and 7.5 inches at the bottom, pour the sugar and water , and bring to a boil to caramelize. When the syrup turns amber, add 1 tsp of butter and swirl the pan to mix it, then turn off the heat.
Arrange the lemon slices on the bottom , close to each other, slightly overlapping to create a spiral . Let cool and prepare the batter: in a bowl, sift the flour and starch .
Sift the baking powder as well and set aside. In a bowl, place the room temperature butter cut into pieces and add the sugar . Beat the mixture with an electric whisk .
Incorporate the eggs , then flavor with the lemon zest and its juice .
When the batter is well mixed, gradually incorporate the dry ingredients, continuing to beat with the whisk . Once the flour is absorbed, the batter is ready , so pour it into the pan .
Level the surface with a spatula and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 45 minutes on the middle rack. Once baked, remove the cake and invert it while still hot onto a serving plate, being careful not to burn yourself. Let the upside-down lemon cake cool before serving .
The upside-down lemon cake can be stored under a glass dome for about 3 days in the refrigerator.
You can freeze it after baking.
