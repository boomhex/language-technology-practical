instructions:
To prepare the broccoli balls, first clean the broccoli: remove the leaves from the green broccoli and take only the florets , then do the same with the Romanesco broccoli . Plunge all the florets into a pot of boiling water .
Add the salt and cook until they are tender. Meanwhile, dice the scamorza . Drain the broccoli and transfer them to a mixer , then blend until you get a smooth mixture.
Pour the mixture into a bowl and add the egg , grated Parmesan , and breadcrumbs .
Season with salt and pepper , then mix everything together . Take a bit of the mixture, flatten it, and place a cube of scamorza in the center .
Close the mixture over the filling and form a ball . Repeat the same process until all ingredients are used. Roll the balls in breadcrumbs to cover them completely .
Place the balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, drizzle with oil , and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 25 minutes, turning them halfway through. Plate them and finish with a few basil leaves. Your broccoli balls are ready to be served !
Broccoli balls can be stored in the refrigerator, sealed in an airtight container, for up to 2-3 days.
If you want to prepare them in advance, you can form the balls and store them raw in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in a closed container, for one day.
You can replace the scamorza with other stringy cheeses like fontina or provolone.
If desired, you can flavor the mixture with parsley, basil, or a pinch of nutmeg.
Don't throw away the broccoli stems and leaves; use them to prepare a tasty Bruschetta with Broccoli Cream to serve with bruschetta!
