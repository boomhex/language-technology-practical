instructions:
Pain au chocolat is a French pastry delight characterized by a fragrant, golden crust and an irresistible chocolate filling. This delicious specialty falls under the category of viennoiserie , which includes yeast-leavened dough pastries, puff pastries, and leavened puff pastries, such as the puff pastry we present here. Making the so-called pâte levée feuilletée at home requires a lot of patience because it is essential to respect the resting and cooling times: for this reason, we followed the instructions of Laura Onofrio and Matteo Andreotti from “Clandestino non esiste,” a young and contemporary Milanese bakery. Similar to Croissant in texture but different in shape, these delightful Saccottini are a true masterpiece of goodness that is worth making at least once with your own hands! You'll see that you'll enjoy it later…
After the pain au chocolat, try preparing the puff pastry roses made with the same dough, and these other typical viennoiserie :

To prepare the pain au chocolat, first pour the milk and water into a bowl with the crumbled yeast , then mix to dissolve it completely .
Transfer the mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a hook , then add the flour and sugar .
Also add the salt and work at low speed for 5 minutes ; the dough should not be too tightly bonded .
Move to the work surface and form a smooth dough piece , then place it in the bowl and cover with several layers of plastic wrap . Let it rise in the refrigerator overnight.
In the meantime, prepare the butter for the puff pastry: in the stand mixer fitted with a paddle, pour the flour and softened butter , then mix until you get a homogeneous mixture ; be careful not to overwork it.
Transfer the mixture onto a sheet of parchment paper , cover with another sheet of parchment paper, and roll it out with a rolling pin to form a square of about 8x8 inches, with a thickness of about 0.4 inches . Place this in the refrigerator to rest as well.
The next morning, take the risen dough and roll it out on a lightly floured surface to obtain a rectangular shape twice the length of the square . Place the square of butter in the center of the rectangle .
Fold the two side flaps inward to completely cover the square of butter, making sure to align the edges of the dough exactly in the middle . Roll out the pastry again with the rolling pin in the direction of the folds, starting with small presses to avoid breaking the butter inside. You should get another rectangle .
At this point, proceed with a 3-fold by folding the side flaps towards the center and aligning them . With a sharp knife, score the long sides of the rectangle obtained . Transfer the pastry to a tray, cover with plastic wrap , and let it chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
After this time, take the dough and proceed with another 3-fold , then place on the tray and let it rest for another 30 minutes in the refrigerator, always covered with plastic wrap. After this time, repeat the same operation for the third and final time, but the rest in the refrigerator will be about 1.5-2 hours.
After this time, the pastry will be well chilled, so roll it out with the rolling pin on a lightly floured surface : you should get a rectangle of about 12x16 inches, with a thickness of 0.2 inches. Use a wheel to divide the pastry into 8 equal rectangles measuring about 6x4 inches . Place 2 chocolate bars on each rectangle, positioning the first near the bottom edge and slightly spacing out the second .
Roll up the pastry rectangles to enclose the chocolate sticks inside , then place the rolls on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, well spaced . Spray the surface with a little water and let them rise at room temperature for about 3 hours. You can cover them with a baking sheet or place them in the turned-off oven with the light on, taking care to spray them with water occasionally if the surface starts to dry out.
After the rising time, pour the yolk, egg, cream, and salt into a small bowl , mix everything , and brush the pain au chocolat twice .
Bake in a preheated convection oven at 356°F for about 6 minutes, then insert a ball of foil into the door to keep it slightly open and continue baking for another 12 minutes . When they are beautifully golden and fragrant, remove from the oven and let them cool slightly . Your pain au chocolat is ready to be enjoyed !
Pain au chocolat can be stored at room temperature for 1-2 days, covered with a dome. It is recommended to warm them slightly in the oven before serving.
If you wish, you can freeze the rolls raw, before the final rising. Let them thaw in the refrigerator, and once they return to room temperature, proceed with the rising as per the recipe.
Baking chocolate bars are ideal for the pain au chocolat recipe and can be easily purchased online; alternatively, you can use 70% baking dark chocolate.
