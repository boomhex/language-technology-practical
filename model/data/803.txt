instructions:
To make the potato toast pizzaiola style, first wash the potatoes under running water and place them in a large pot filled with water. Cook them for about 35 minutes . When they are soft, remove them from the heat and let them cool slightly. Peel the potatoes, pass them through a potato masher, and collect the puree in a bowl . Add the egg to the mixture.
Add salt and all-purpose flour . Mix the mixture until you obtain a soft and well-workable dough . Place a sheet of parchment paper on a work surface and sprinkle it with breadcrumbs. Take a portion of dough (about 3 oz) and place it on the parchment paper, shaping it into a square with your hands .
Pour one teaspoon of tomato puree in the center , add oregano, basil, and a slice of well-drained and dried mozzarella .
Close the filling with another portion of potato dough (again about 3 oz) and shape it into a square with your hands . With the given quantities, you will get 4 toasts .
In a non-stick pan, heat extra virgin olive oil. Add the potato toast pizzaiola style, a maximum of two at a time , and let them brown on both sides, turning them occasionally for about 10 minutes . Serve the potato toast pizzaiola style hot .
You can store the raw potato toast pizzaiola style for 1 day in the refrigerator, well covered with plastic wrap, and cooked ones can be stored in the fridge for 2 days, always covered with plastic. You can freeze them before or after cooking.
You can bake the potato toasts in a static oven at 392°F for 15 minutes; if using a fan oven, reduce the temperature to 356°F. Instead of mozzarella, you can use provola.
