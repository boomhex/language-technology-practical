To prepare the coconut and chocolate muffins, first chop the dark chocolate with a knife , then melt it in a double boiler or microwave and let it cool. Meanwhile, pour the whole eggs into a bowl ,
add the sugar and mix with an electric mixer until you get a soft and frothy mixture .
Pour the coconut milk and start mixing again at a lower speed , then add the vegetable oil and finally the melted chocolate .
Now take care of the dry ingredients: sift the all-purpose flour and unsweetened cocoa powder into a bowl along with the baking powder and mix well with a spoon .
Now take the egg mixture and add the dry ingredients one spoon at a time, keeping the mixer running . When the dry ingredients are well incorporated, add the desiccated coconut and mix with a spatula from the bottom up to combine everything .
Line a muffin tin with paper liners, then fill them with the batter leaving about 1/2 inch from the top . Bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 20 minutes, then take them out and let them cool . Finally, garnish with a sprinkle of shredded coconut: your coconut and chocolate muffins are ready to be enjoyed !
