Bacetti golosi —oh, these are the kind of Italian treat you just can’t forget. You know, the ones that linger on your taste buds long after that last bite. These Italian kiss cookies are all about sharing some sweetness, making them a hit on Valentine’s Day or whenever you want to show a little love. Seriously good stuff.
The outside is tender yet a bit crunchy, cracking open to reveal a creamy center. And here’s the thing, the raspberry jam and whipped cream inside give you a sweet and fruity pop. Really, it’s so so good. Add a generous drizzle of melted dark chocolate on top, and every bite feels extra special—maybe even decadent. In Italy, some folks like to switch things up with different jams like apricot or cherry. Or, you know, swap the cream for chocolate ganache for that rich, chocolate hazelnut cookies vibe. So yeah, plenty of options to suit different tastes.
Often, these Bacetti golosi recipe ideas pop up at tea time with something hot and soothing. Or they get wrapped up as homemade gifts. The moist center with that golden outer shell—it's what makes them stand out from other traditional Italian desserts .

They’re small, so grabbing another (or two) is easy, and they look seriously fancy stacked on a plate.
Whether you’re into the classic jam and cream filling or experimenting with chocolate or nuts, these homemade Bacetti golosi are perfect alongside other Italian baking recipes. Nothing too fussy. Just sweet, creamy, and a bit romantic—ideal for making any day feel special. If you want something that feels homey yet luxurious, these chocolate-filled cookies really really hit the spot. So, next time you’re aiming to impress with a touch of Italian flair, give Bacetti golosi a go. Enjoy that awesome blend of flavors and textures—no question.
To prepare the tasty kisses, start with the dough for the shells. Take a large bowl (you can use a stand mixer if you prefer) in which you will add the room-temperature eggs and the sugar little by little . Turn on the electric beaters at medium speed until you obtain a light and frothy mixture: it will take about 10 minutes . When it's ready, sift the flour into it .
Sift the yeast into the bowl as well and gently mix with the other ingredients using a spatula : you should make gentle movements from bottom to top to incorporate the sifted ingredients without deflating the mixture. Once the ingredients are well combined, transfer the mixture into a pastry bag .
At this point, line a baking sheet with parchment paper and create small dough discs about 1.18 inches in diameter , making sure to space them well apart. You should obtain 20 discs that you will bake in a static preheated oven at 374°F for 12 minutes (we do not recommend using a convection oven): the cookies should slightly puff up and take on a light golden color .
After the baking time, you can remove them from the oven and place them on a wire rack to cool . While the shells cool, focus on the filling, starting with the whipped cream: take a clean bowl, pour in the cold fresh cream from the fridge and turn on the clean electric beaters, adding the icing sugar little by little , then continue to whip until the cream is fluffy (for a detail on this operation follow our cooking school: How to Whip Cream ). Transfer the whipped cream into a pastry bag with a star-shaped nozzle and the jam into another pastry bag with a plain nozzle (if you don't have nozzles, you can still use two disposable pastry bags and just cut the tip).
Start filling the surface of 10 shells with the jam . Also decorate with the whipped cream , then place the other shells on top to close : you will get 10 tasty kisses.
Finally, take the chocolate, chop it and melt it in a double boiler like this: place a small pot with a little water on the stove and place a bowl on top where you will pour the chocolate to melt ; melt it in a double boiler, stirring with a wooden spoon . Once it's well melted, transfer it into a parchment paper cone you have shaped like a pastry bag (for more detail you can consult our cooking school on how to make a cone with parchment paper): decorate your tasty kisses by drawing parallel lines on the top shell of the cookies and... enjoy!
It is recommended to consume the tasty kisses as soon as they are filled, but the shells can be prepared in advance and stored for about 4-5 days, covered by a glass dome.
Freezing is not recommended.
Irresistible tasty kisses? Try flavoring the dough with the seeds of a vanilla bean or vanilla flavoring, or the untreated zest of a lemon! Finally, a trick to serve these kisses: fill them just before serving because in this way the cream will not deflate and the jam will not stain the whipped cream.
