instructions:
To prepare the spring focaccia, start with the dough. In a bowl, combine the flours , the crumbled yeast , and all the water .
Start mixing with a spoon and when the water has been absorbed, transfer the dough onto the workbench and knead energetically until it is homogeneous .
At this point, add the oil in three stages , adding more only when the first dose has been absorbed by the dough. Once all the oil is absorbed , add the salt and knead until it is well incorporated.
Add the 3 dried herbs as well and knead for another 5 minutes or so , or until the dough is smooth and homogeneous .
Place it in a bowl and cover with clingfilm , let it rise at room temperature for about 2 hours or until doubled . Transfer the dough onto the work surface and flatten it slightly with your hands .
Transfer it to a previously greased 10x7 inch baking tray . Spread the focaccia by stretching the dough with your fingertips and gently pulling it until it covers the entire surface .
Cover with clingfilm and let it rise again for about 30 minutes at room temperature. In the meantime, prepare the asparagus. Pour a drizzle of oil into a pan and add the frozen asparagus .
Sauté them for about 5 minutes and season with salt and pepper . When they are ready , transfer them to a bowl and let them cool .
Now, with oiled hands, make the classic dimples in the dough, pressing gently , then sprinkle with oil and flakes of salt .
At this point, bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the asparagus in half lengthwise . After the first 20 minutes, remove the focaccia from the oven and cover it with the stracchino, tearing it with your hands or with a spoon .
Arrange the asparagus towards the short side of the focaccia , lining them all up . Bake again for 25 minutes. Once the focaccia is well browned, remove from the oven and sprinkle with fresh thyme and marjoram . Serve the spring focaccia warm or cold.
You can store the focaccia in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 days.
You can use another type of cheese instead of stracchino.
