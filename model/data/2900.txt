So, next time you're in the mood for an easy coffee mousse that feels fancy without the fuss, this recipe brings together the best of Tuscan tradition and Italian coffee culture. Just grab a cup and a few good biscuits. Seriously good.
To prepare the coffee mousse in a cup with cantucci, start by making coffee with the moka pot: put cold water, preferably low in limescale, inside the boiler up to the safety valve (otherwise you will get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee and level it with each teaspoon of coffee added, tapping the filter on the table with decisive movements , until reaching the rim of the filter.
Do not press down with the teaspoon, nor create holes, and tightly screw the moka pot (to prevent coffee from leaking out the sides while it rises), then place it on a low and steady flame to get a rich coffee. As the coffee rises, a dense froth will form ; we recommend not letting the coffee bubble for too long to preserve its aroma and sweetness. Then turn off the heat, and your coffee for use in the preparation is ready: stir it directly in the moka pot with a teaspoon to make it more homogeneous .
Now focus on preparing the cantucci: first, preheat the oven to 375°F and when it reaches the temperature, toast the hazelnuts well laid out on a baking sheet for 3-4 minutes; then remove them from the oven and let them cool. Then proceed to make the dough for the cantucci: place the 4 whole eggs and one yolk in the stand mixer (or in a large bowl) and add a pinch of salt and the granulated sugar. Separately, sift the flour and add the baking powder
and the powdered coffee . Coarsely chop the hazelnuts with a mixer . Then, when the egg and sugar mixture is light and frothy, pour in the dry ingredients
Now add the melted butter , the hazelnuts , and mix to obtain a crumbly and soft mixture .
Transfer the mixture to a floured work surface and compact it by hand to form a uniform ball. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to firm up for at least half an hour. After this time, take the dough, cut it into 3 loaves about 12 inches long ;
transfer the loaves to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, brush them with the lightly beaten whole egg , and bake for 20 minutes in a preheated oven at 375°F. After this time, remove the loaves , let them cool for a few minutes, and then cut them diagonally to get biscuits (cantucci) about 0.5-0.6 inches thick.
Place the resulting biscuits back on the baking sheet and bake them at 340°F for about 10-15 minutes . Now you can focus on the dark mousse by preparing the coffee meringue: Place 30 ml of coffee and 75 g of granulated sugar in a saucepan with a thick bottom , heat the mixture over low heat and stir to dissolve the sugar; as soon as the syrup begins to boil, immerse the kitchen thermometer, which will indicate the temperature, when the syrup reaches 240°F. Start whipping the egg whites at medium speed with a stand mixer equipped with whisks, and as soon as they turn white, add 50 g of sugar. The egg whites must be well whipped when the syrup reaches 250°F. When the syrup reaches the indicated temperature, pour it slowly into the egg whites ,
continuing to whip with the whisks until the meringue is completely cooled . Soak the gelatin in cold water to soften and then dissolve it in 50 ml of warm cream . Separately, whip 150 ml of cream with an electric whisk following the How to Whip Cream guide.
and gently incorporate it into the meringue . Add the cream and gelatin mixture and let the mousse set in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. The dark mousse is ready, now focus on the light one: soak the gelatin in cold water to soften ,
flavor 200 ml of liquid cream with coffee beans and let them infuse for at least one night in the refrigerator . After this time, remove the coffee beans by draining the cream and whip the cream with powdered sugar . Separately, dissolve the softened and well-drained gelatin in 50 ml of warm cream.
Add the dissolved gelatin to the mousse and let the mousse set in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. After this time, you can assemble the dessert: take small glasses and pour in ¾ of the dark mousse with a piping bag, then complete the surface with the light mousse . Finish by dusting with some cocoa powder . Serve the coffee mousse in a cup accompanied by hazelnut cantucci.
Store the mousse in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for no more than 2 days. The cantucci can be stored in a tin box or jar for up to a week.
To make the cantucci, you can replace the hazelnuts with traditional almonds or, for a more indulgent version, with dark chocolate chips.
