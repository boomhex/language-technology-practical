instructions:
To prepare the cuzzetiello with meatballs, first put a drizzle of oil and garlic in a pot . Sauté over medium heat for a few minutes, then add the tomato puree , a few basil leaves , and water. Adjust the salt and pepper, lower the heat, and cook for at least 30 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the meatballs. Soak the bread crumb in a bowl . In another bowl, put the ground beef, the pork , and add the egg .
Add the grated Parmesan cheese . Chop parsley and garlic with a knife and add them to the bowl .
Adjust the salt and pepper . Finally, add the well-squeezed crumb . Knead until you get a homogeneous mixture.
Take some of the mixture and roll it between your hands to form large meatballs . Repeat the same steps until you finish the mixture. In a non-stick pan, heat the oil, and when it's hot, add the meatballs and cook them on all sides over medium heat for about 6-7 minutes, until golden .
Remove the garlic . Transfer the meatballs to the sauce and let them flavor for 1-2 minutes over medium-low heat . Cut the ends of the bread to obtain 4 pieces of about 5 oz each.
Hollow out to remove the crumb and fill them with the sauce and 2-3 meatballs . The cuzzetiello with meatballs is ready to be enjoyed !
The cuzzetiello with meatballs should be eaten as soon as it's ready. The meatballs can be prepared the day before.
For a meat-free alternative, you can replace the classic meatballs with eggplant, chickpea, or ricotta and spinach meatballs. If you want to make your cuzzetiello even more delicious, add a nice slice of melting cheese, even mozzarella if you prefer, and toast it in the oven for just a few minutes to melt it.
