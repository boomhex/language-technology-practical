instructions:
To prepare the chickpea flour flatbread, sift the flour . Add a pinch of salt and water at room temperature .
Mix with a hand whisk to obtain a smooth batter . Then pour in the seed oil and mix again until well combined. You should achieve a smooth batter without lumps, similar to crepe batter. Heat a non-stick or crepe pan with a diameter of 8 inches over low heat and pour in a ladle of batter. Swirl the pan to create an even layer. The surface should thicken, and bubbles will form .
Flip the flatbread with the help of a spatula and continue cooking for a couple of minutes on the other side . Then transfer the flatbread to a plate and continue in this way until the batter is used up. As the flatbreads are cooked, stack them on top of each other so that the residual heat keeps them soft and easy to roll. Your chickpea flatbreads are ready to be filled !
The chickpea flatbreads can be stored in the refrigerator for 1 or 2 days, in an airtight container or on a plate covered with plastic wrap.
You can prepare the batter in advance and store it in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for up to a day. Before proceeding with cooking the flatbreads, let the batter sit at room temperature for about ten minutes.
Freezing is not recommended.
You can enrich the batter with a mix of aromatic herbs or powdered spices: turmeric, curry, or sweet paprika.
