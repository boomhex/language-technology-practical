Tagliatelle alla boscaiola is a rich and comforting Italian dish that embodies the flavors of the forest in every bite. This traditional autumn pasta combines homemade egg tagliatelle with a rustic sauce made from porcini mushrooms, Italian sausage, and peeled tomatoes, creating a delicious balance of earthy flavors and hearty texture. The origins of this dish can be traced back to the woodcutters (boscaioli) of northern and central Italy, who prepared it using foraged mushrooms and locally made pasta. Over time, variations emerged, some featuring cream for a silkier sauce, while others incorporated pancetta for a smoky depth of flavor. Our version stays true to the authentic recipe, ensuring that the homemade pasta absorbs the essence of the sauce, delivering an indulgent and satisfying experience. Generously topped with Parmesan and fresh parsley, this pasta is ideal for cozy family dinners or festive gatherings. Whether you prefer it with or without cream, Tagliatelle alla Boscaiola remains one of Italy’s most beloved dishes, offering a taste of tradition and comfort in every forkful. Try our authentic recipe to bring the rustic flavors of the Italian countryside to your table and savor a dish that has stood the test of time.

To prepare the tagliatelle alla boscaiola, start with the fresh pasta. Pour the flour onto a pastry board and create the classic fountain shape; place the eggs in the center , add a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt .
Initially work by beating with a fork , then help yourself with a dough scraper and knead until you have a uniform mixture .
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes in a cool place. In the meantime, take care of the porcini mushrooms. Remove the larger soil residues with a knife, then clean them with a damp cloth . Separate the caps from the stems .
Cut the mushrooms into cubes about 1-2 inches , and move on to the sausage. Remove the outer casing and crumble it coarsely by hand to form balls about an inch in size .
In a large pan, pour some oil and the chopped shallot . Let it fry gently, then add the sausage and mushrooms . Stir well, brown them thoroughly, and deglaze with white wine .
Once the alcohol has evaporated, pour in the crushed peeled tomatoes with a fork or by hand . Stir well and cover with a lid ; let it cook for about 25 minutes. In the meantime, take the fresh pasta again as soon as the resting time is over. Take a piece and sprinkle it with flour .
Use a pasta machine to thin it out; pass it several times through the rollers until you get a thickness of about 1/8 inch . You can fold the pasta on itself as you go to obtain a homogeneous sheet. Once you have the sheet, cut out rectangles of pasta . Consider that the length of the rectangle will be the length of the tagliatelle, so we recommend obtaining rectangles about 8 inches long. At this point, roll the pasta rectangle first from one side and then from the other without tightening .
Cut the tagliatelle with a knife to a thickness of about 1/4 inch ; then wrap them around your hand to form a nest and continue with the others . At this point, the sauce will be ready .
Cook the tagliatelle in plenty of salted water . Once cooked after a few minutes, drain them and transfer them directly into the sauce . Add plenty of chopped parsley .
Sauté everything well, adding cooking water if needed . Plate, finish with grated Parmesan , and serve your tagliatelle alla boscaiola .
We recommend consuming the tagliatelle alla boscaiola immediately; alternatively, you can store them for up to a day.
If you prefer, you can use speck instead of sausage. Instead of shallot, you can also use onion, and if you love spicy flavors, add some chili pepper.
