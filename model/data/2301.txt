Apple and culatello parcels bring the really good taste of Emilia-Romagna right to your kitchen. Seriously good. This dish blends sweet and savory flavors in a way that's pretty much surprising. The region up in Northern Italy is famous for its top-notch cured meats. And culatello? It's a standout—soft, tender, slightly moist. It's from the Parma area, and you’ll love it.
These parcels wrap slices of this delicate meat with Fuji apples inside flaky, crispy pastry. Can't go wrong with that combo. Fuji apples hold their shape and juiciness while baking. Plus, a sprinkle of sugar and hazelnut granules adds just a touch of sweetness and crunch. And the aroma? Really, it fills the room and promises a special treat. It's not what you'd expect from traditional Italian kitchens, but honestly, it feels like it belongs.
Some folks might think antipasti should be purely savory or sweet, but this treat strikes a balance. Each bite offers a mix of golden pastry, lightly sweet fruit, and rich, salty cured meat. The Fuji apples stay firm and juicy, perfectly complementing the soft culatello. In Emilia-Romagna, locals love pairing their meats with seasonal fruits. And you know, these apple and ham pastry parcels are a great example of this tradition, with a unique twist.
You might even find variations using prosciutto, appearing as apple and prosciutto parcels at gatherings or wine tastings. So here's the thing—these apple and ham pastry parcels are fantastic as appetizers or snacks, always sparking conversation. No question. There's something about the tangy apple flavor mingling with savory ham and warm, fragrant pastry that keeps you coming back for more. Whether you are exploring an apple and culatello recipe or seeking something different for your next get-together, these parcels are an easy and delicious way to bring northern Italian flavor to the table. Enjoy them as a chic starter or a fun snack—either way, they're bound to impress.
To prepare the apple and culatello pastry, start with the filling. Take the apples, cut them in half and peel them . Remove the core and cut them first into wedges, then into cubes . Then take a non-stick pan with high sides and add the sugar .
Then squeeze the juice of an orange and strain it through a fine mesh sieve, collecting the juice in a small bowl . Pour it into the pan . Heat gently for a few minutes, stirring well to dissolve the sugar.
Once the sugar is dissolved, add the apples and let them soften over very low heat for 15 minutes, continuing to stir . The apple should not completely disintegrate by the end of cooking but remain sufficiently soft. When ready, transfer to a bowl, let cool slightly, then add the hazelnut crumbs .
Mix the ingredients well to combine them and set aside. Then focus on the pastry: take it and use a pastry cutter to cut each rectangular sheet of pastry into four squares of 6 inches per side . Space out the pastry squares and place slices of culatello in the center of each piece .
On top of it, add apple chunks , being careful not to add too much apple liquid because it could make the pastry too wet, causing the liquid to seep out during baking. Repeat the steps for the other 7 pastries, until the ingredients are used up. Then take an egg and beat it with a fork : brush it on the edges of the pastry to help seal the pastry .
Fold the pastries in half and align all the edges. Seal them with the tines of a fork to prevent the filling from leaking during cooking. At this point, the pastries are ready: place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush the surface with the remaining beaten egg . Finally, bake in a preheated static oven at 428°F for about 12 minutes (if using a convection oven, 392°F for about 8 minutes: we suggest testing the cooking of one pastry to better gauge the others).
After this time, remove them and let them cool slightly on a cutting board or serving plate . Enjoy your apple and culatello pastries !
You can store your apple and culatello pastries for up to 2 days in the refrigerator, in an airtight container.
We do not recommend freezing them once cooked. However, you can freeze the pastries before baking them in the oven only if you have used all fresh and not thawed ingredients.
For those who want to get creative in the kitchen with this preparation, we suggest many tasty variations: instead of culatello, you could use a sweet prosciutto, replace the orange juice with lemon juice, and add cinnamon for flavor. If you prefer, you can also add finely chopped walnuts, hazelnuts, and/or almonds to the hazelnut crumbs. So let your imagination run wild with this recipe!
