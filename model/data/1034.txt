instructions:
To make the beetroot frittata, first wash and then chop mint and parsley . Thinly slice the precooked beetroot . Beat the eggs with a whisk .
Season with grated cheese , a pinch of salt , and add the chopped aromatic herbs .
Mix again to combine everything . In a pan about 8.5 inches in diameter, pour a drizzle of oil, spread it as evenly as possible, and heat it. Then add about half of the mixture . Cook for 5 minutes or until the eggs are slightly set. Lay the beet slices .
Cover with the remaining mixture and cook for another 5 minutes or until the base of the frittata is firm enough. At this point , place a plate or lid of the same diameter on top ,

flip the frittata with a quick and decisive motion . Continue cooking on the other side for about 5 more minutes or until the frittata is cooked through. Serve the beetroot frittata hot .
The beetroot frittata can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days. We do not recommend freezing it.
To make the beetroot frittata even more appetizing, add thinly sliced Emmentaler or Asiago cheese to the mixture.
