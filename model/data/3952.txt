To prepare the gnocchetti with ham and saffron, sift the all-purpose flour in a large bowl , add the breadcrumbs , the eggs and the two yolks .
Cut the cooked ham into small pieces and add it to the bowl , then add the grated Grana Padano cheese ,
the milk , nutmeg , and a pinch of salt. Work the dough inside the bowl with your hands ,
until you get a smooth and homogeneous mixture . Form a loaf, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least one hour . After the indicated time, take the dough out of the fridge and work it to obtain "sausages" not too thick, then cut them into pieces about 3/4 inch
and pass them over the special ridged wooden board (or the tines of a fork) to form the characteristic grooves of the gnocchi and the indentation underneath, which will help better collect the sauce. When all the gnocchi are ready, place them on a floured tray and proceed to prepare the sauce. In a large pan, melt the butter , then add the very finely chopped onion and let it wilt for about 15 minutes over very low heat, until it becomes translucent but not colored .
At this point, add the fresh cream , the saffron powder , salt, and ground white pepper. Mix everything well and let it thicken slightly over low heat. Meanwhile, cook the gnocchetti, one portion at a time, in plenty of boiling salted water until they come to the surface ,
then remove them from the pot using a slotted spoon and add them to the sauce : sauté them for a few seconds, then turn off the heat. At this point, add the grated cheese and chopped parsley . Mix everything well, plate, decorate with some saffron strands, and serve the gnocchetti with ham and saffron hot.
You can store the gnocchetti with ham and saffron, closed in an airtight container and placed in the refrigerator, for up to 1 day. You can prepare the gnocchetti in advance and freeze them by putting them in the freezer before cooking: place them on a tray and then, when they are frozen, transfer them into suitable food bags. This way, you will prevent the gnocchi from sticking to each other.
Once, owning saffron was a true sign of wealth, to the point that mothers would keep the precious spice as a dowry for their daughters to marry.
It's all a matter of taste: cooked ham, raw ham, or bacon? Butter or extra virgin olive oil? The choice is yours!
