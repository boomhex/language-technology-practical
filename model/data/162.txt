instructions:
To prepare the buttons and lovage, start with the fresh pasta: boil the spinach in salted water for about 2-3 minutes . Drain them in a bowl with ice water to cool and maintain the vibrant color .
Squeeze the spinach and transfer them to a blender . Blend until you get a cream . In a bowl, pour the all-purpose flour .
Add the semolina , egg white , sunflower oil, and 100 grams of spinach cream . Mix to incorporate all the ingredients.
Transfer the mixture onto a floured surface and continue kneading to form a homogeneous dough. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for an hour . Meanwhile, focus on the filling: cut the cheese into cubes .
In a saucepan, heat the cream, then incorporate the cheese and stir with a whisk until it melts. At this point, add the cornstarch dissolved in a little water , mix, and turn off the heat. Blend the cream with an immersion blender to make it smooth .
To remove any lumps, pass the cream through a sieve and let it cool . Now focus on the lovage oil: pour the lovage leaves and seed oil into a pitcher .
Blend with the immersion blender until the oil slightly warms , then strain through cheesecloth to remove impurities .
Let the oil settle while continuing with the recipe . Prepare the lovage broth: heat the buttermilk in a saucepan and add the butter , stir to melt it completely, then add 35 grams of lovage oil .
Stir with the whisk to obtain a homogeneous emulsion . Set aside and take the dough: sprinkle it with semolina on both sides .
Roll out the dough with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 1/32 inch and sprinkle more semolina on both sides to prevent sticking . Even out the edges and squeeze small portions of filling onto half of the sheet, spacing them well apart .
To facilitate closing the buttons, moisten the sheet with water before folding it to avoid opening during cooking. Press the two overlapping sheets gently but firmly to make them adhere well, particularly around the filling, to seal it. Use a 1 1/2-inch diameter cutter, pressing it with the non-cutting side down (the side without the sharp edge), to remove the air around the filling, compact it in the center, and start to outline the shape. Then, using the same cutter with the sharp edge, cut the buttons following the previously formed outlines. This way, you'll get perfectly round and well-sealed buttons .
The pasta buttons are ready ; with these quantities, you'll get about 40. Cook the buttons in plenty of boiling, lightly salted water . The cooking should be quick, just enough time for the filling to melt. Drain the buttons onto plates .
Season with lovage broth and lovage oil , then garnish with fresh herbs from the garden. Your buttons and lovage are ready to be served !
We recommend consuming the buttons and lovage immediately.
You can freeze the uncooked buttons this way: place them on a tray and freeze until firm, then transfer to freezer bags.
Lovage, also known as mountain celery, has an intense, herbaceous aroma, somewhat similar to celery and parsley, with slightly spicy notes. If you can't find it fresh, you can substitute it with a mix of herbs with a similar aromatic profile.
