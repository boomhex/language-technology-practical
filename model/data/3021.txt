Fasolari ripieni alle erbe is one of those dishes you'll find along Italy’s Adriatic Coast . And look, when locals want to keep things simple and really, really show off what the sea has to offer, this is it. People here—honestly—know how to treat seafood, and it shows in this ricetta fasolari ripieni . The fasolari? They're plump, tender mollusks straight from the Upper Adriatic. Super tasty. Folks stuff them with a mix of fresh herbs, breadcrumbs, a touch of Grana cheese , and some zesty lemon peel. The real deal. Plus, you get that classic sea flavor from the fasolari’s own cooking water—really brings out the briny goodness.
With just a quick bake, the stuffing turns golden and stays moist, while the mollusk keeps that nice, juicy bite. And listen, this isn’t just any seafood dish—it's about honoring the freshness of frutti di mare al forno like they do in Italian coastal kitchens, no heavy seasonings needed. Sometimes you'll see fasolari in pastas or seafood lasagna, but stuffing them like this feels pretty special.
It's an antipasto di mare, but seriously, it’s just as good as a main course if you want something light yet full of intense, natural flavor. The trick is, don’t overwork the mollusks—they’re pounded gently and baked fast, so everything stays moist and delicate. Regional cooks really value this kind of care—every ingredient gets its moment to shine. Fasolari ripieni alle erbe are often served with a bit of lemon or simple greens—so the fasolari al forno and herbs take center stage. If you’re into conchiglie ripiene or enjoy trying different kinds of molluschi ripieni , you’ll love how the Adriatic method keeps it straightforward.
Pretty much lets the seafood do all the talking. It's the sort of dish that makes you wish you were right there by the sea, enjoying food that's fresh, a bit salty, and unmistakably Italian. Whether as a starter or a light main, it’s a real taste of the Adriatic’s culinary heart.
To prepare the herb-stuffed fasolari, start by extracting the mollusks from their shells (for cleaning the fasolari, you can also check the Cooking School: How to clean fasolari ). Insert the blade of a small knife a few millimeters between the two valves , slide it laterally, keeping the blade angled upward. Gently force the shell open and cut the other muscle laterally. Before extracting the mollusk, get a small bowl to catch the fasolari liquid, which you'll use for cooking. Remove the grayish skin covering the fruit and the intestinal sac . Detach the fasolaro from the lower part of the shell as well. Set the shells aside and place the fasolari on a cutting board, while the liquid should be strained through a fine-mesh sieve and set aside; you'll need 100 ml .
To tenderize the mollusk's meat, pound the mollusks with a mallet or meat tenderizer, focusing on the red foot, which is tougher , then roughly chop them and collect them in a bowl .
Meanwhile, prepare the herb filling: in a small bowl, place the breadcrumbs and add the grated Grana Padano . Then add the minced garlic clove and tear the mint leaves with your hands .
Add whole basil leaves , coarsely chopped parsley , and a drizzle of olive oil .
Then pour the reserved fasolari liquid into the small bowl and mix the ingredients with a teaspoon before pouring them into the blender (if you don't have a blender, you can finely chop all the herbs with a knife).
Blend until you get a smooth cream . Gather it in a small bowl, grate the untreated lemon zest , and mix it into the mixture .
Then wash the fasolari shells and let them dry on a kitchen towel . Divide the shell into two halves and fill each shell with the chopped fasolari and then a teaspoon of filling .
Carefully fill each shell , then place the stuffed shells on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Bake in a preheated static oven at 400°F for 25 minutes (if using a fan oven, bake at 355°F for 15-20 minutes). After the required time, turn on the grill for 5 minutes to achieve a crispy surface. Then remove your herb-stuffed fasolari from the oven and serve them hot!
Gratinated fasolari can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. Freezing is not recommended.
Unleash your creativity with aromas: fresh thyme, mint leaves, chili pepper... Let your imagination and taste guide you! The only thing you absolutely must not add is salt to the filling: the fasolari liquid is already very flavorful, so trust mother nature and her choices regarding the seasoning of dishes :)
