instructions:
To make the ACE cake, first grate the lemon and orange zest, being careful not to take the white part . Squeeze and strain the juice from both the lemon and the orange ; you will need 145 g in total. Finally, peel the carrots and grate them with a fine grater .
Start whisking the eggs with the sugar in a large bowl . Add the grated citrus zest and continue to mix with the electric whisk until the mixture becomes light and fluffy, then gradually add the flour .
Add the baking powder , then slowly pour in the citrus juice and the vegetable oil .
Finally, add the grated carrots and mix for a few more minutes to obtain a homogeneous mixture . Pour the batter into a 9-inch diameter bundt pan and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 55 minutes.
After this time, check the cooking with a toothpick, then remove from the oven and let it cool . Turn out the bundt cake and dust with powdered sugar to taste . Your ACE cake is ready to be enjoyed !
The ACE cake can be stored at room temperature for 2-3 days, under a glass dome. You can freeze it after baking, possibly already sliced.
If you wish, you can decorate the ACE cake with a glaze like the one we made for the bundt cake! Enrich the batter with some nuts for a crunchy note.
