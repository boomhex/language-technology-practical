instructions:
To prepare the Danubio with Nutella, start by pouring the all-purpose flour and bread flour into the bowl of a stand mixer with a hook attachment , add the crumbled fresh yeast , and milk at room temperature .
Add the brown sugar and turn on the mixer at medium-low speed to mix the ingredients. Then add the eggs at room temperature, one at a time . Wait for one to be absorbed before adding the next. Finally, add a pinch of salt, then the vanilla bean seeds .
Now it's time for the butter, added one piece at a time at room temperature . Don't rush this stage and let the mixer work until the dough is well kneaded, meaning it clings to the hook . Pour the dough onto the work surface and knead briefly by hand .
Form a ball and place the dough in a bowl, cover with cling film . Let it rise for a couple of hours at room temperature (the ideal temperature is 77/81°F) or until the dough doubles in size .
After the resting time, detach the dough from the bowl and divide it into 20 pieces weighing 1.25 oz each using a dough scraper . Flatten with a rolling pin and, using a piping bag, fill the center with 0.35 oz of Nutella .
Then lift one end and match it with the opposite one , repeat for the other two until completely closed .
Gently roll into balls and ensure they are well sealed so the filling doesn't escape . Continue this way with all the balls and gradually transfer them to a fluted mold with a base of 9 inches, previously buttered . Cover with cling film, simply laying it on the surface, and let rise for another hour .
After the time has passed, brush the surface with beaten eggs and cream together and proceed to baking : Danubio with Nutella bakes in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 30 minutes. Let cool before serving .
You can store the Danubio with Nutella at room temperature for a couple of days, keep it covered with cling film or under a cake dome.
It can be frozen once completely cooled. The texture of the Nutella may vary.
Want to make your Danubio with Nutella special? Scent the dough with orange zest instead of vanilla.
If you have dry yeast, you can use 0.1 oz.
You can add sugar sprinkles on the surface before baking.
If you don't have brown sugar, use the same amount of granulated sugar: the result will be the same, just a bit less aromatic and slightly lighter.
