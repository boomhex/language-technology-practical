Danish butter cookies? Oh, they're the real deal. People just love them for their crispy bite and rich, buttery taste. Traditional Danish cookies are at every gathering you can think of—from holiday parties to casual tea breaks. Folks in Denmark? They've been baking these sweet rounds forever. But then, pastry chef Iginio Massari comes along and kicks it up a notch. And how? He adds chocolate chips to the Danish cookies recipe . That deeper flavor—so so good—pairs amazingly with the usual tender, melt-in-your-mouth feel.
Sometimes, he even suggests dipping them in melted dark chocolate, which, I gotta say, is like a double hit—first the golden, slightly crumbly cookie, then that rich chocolate finish. And here's the thing, you end up reaching for just one more. Especially if you've got a hot cup of tea or coffee.
Throughout Denmark, you’ll find places putting their own spin on homemade Danish cookies . Some make them extra sweet; others go for super moist and crunchy at the same time. What’s awesome about these Danish butter cookies is how the simple ingredients can taste so so special. Plus, if you follow Massari’s lead with that chocolate touch, it’s really something. Kids adore the way the chocolate melts in your hands. And adults? They love that extra flavor pop.
Honestly, these treats are all about cozy afternoons and holidays. They fit right in with other Christmas cookies or even fancy Scandinavian cakes. The chocolate-dipped version? Feels almost like a little bakery secret. Even though the recipe is classic, those tweaks make these cookies stand out on the snack table. Seriously, a traditional Danish cookie recipe can still wow you.
Thing is, that’s the magic of Danish baking—simple, yet always room for a twist that turns an ordinary snack into something really really memorable. Enjoy them with friends or during a quiet moment. Either way, these cookies are a pretty good way to savor a bit of Danish tradition.
To prepare Danish biscuits, the first thing to do is make the dough. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle, add the softened butter , powdered sugar , and vanilla bean seeds .
Also add the salt . Start the machine on the lowest speed, then when the ingredients begin to combine, increase the speed until you achieve a creamy mixture. Incorporate one egg , allow it to be absorbed and add some hazelnut flour .
As soon as it is absorbed, add the rest of the hazelnut flour and then the remaining egg . Continue working the dough, and if necessary, use a spatula to clean the edges of the bowl. When everything is well incorporated, add half of the milk , and add the already sifted flour to the dough one tablespoon at a time .
Pour in the remaining milk , let it absorb until you obtain a creamy dough . Add the chocolate chips .
and mix again to combine them with the rest . Transfer the dough to a pastry bag with a plain 1 cm (0.4 inches) nozzle . Shape the biscuits into sticks about 2 inches long on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper .
Bake the biscuits in a static oven at 356°F for 20 minutes. Take the biscuits out of the oven , let them cool, and when they are completely cold, you can decorate some by dipping them halfway in tempered dark chocolate . You can dip them on the longer side, the shorter side, or diagonally. As you dip the biscuits in the chocolate, remove the excess on the edge of the bowl and place them on a tray lined with parchment paper or a cooling rack . Let the chocolate solidify in a cool place and enjoy them!
You can store Danish biscuits for two weeks in an airtight container.
Alternatively, it is possible to freeze them for a month.
Instead of hazelnut flour, you can use any type of nuts to make Danish biscuits, except for walnuts, which are too buttery and flavorful for this kind of pastry.
