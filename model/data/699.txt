instructions:
To prepare the cheesecake with crème brûlée, first put the cookies in a food processor and blend them until you get a powder . Add the melted and cooled butter .
Also add the grated lemon zest and blend until you get a smooth consistency . Line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan and pour the mixture inside .
Level it with the back of a spoon, pressing gently to form an even base . Transfer to the freezer for 15 minutes. In the meantime, prepare the cream. First, extract the juice from a lemon .
Transfer the cream cheese into a bowl , add the lemon juice , and mix with a whisk .
Pour the cold cream into another bowl, start beating with an electric mixer, and add the powdered sugar . Do not overbeat it; it should be semi-whipped . Fold the cream into the cheese mixture .
Mix with a hand whisk and transfer the obtained cream into the mold with the cookie base . Level the surface and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
After two hours, prepare the cream. Pour the milk into a saucepan, add the vanilla seeds and the pod . Also, add the lemon zest, peeling it with a knife . Heat the milk over low heat until it reaches a boil. Meanwhile, pour the yolks and sugar into a bowl .
Work them with a hand whisk and also add the flour or starch . Mix to incorporate it until you get a homogeneous mixture. When the milk starts to boil, remove the vanilla pod and lemon zest. Pour it into the yolk mixture, stirring with the whisk .
Pour it back into the saucepan and return to the gentle heat. Stir with a whisk until it thickens . Let it cool for a few minutes, then pour the cream over the cheesecake .
Level it with a spatula to completely cover the cheese cream . Place in the refrigerator for an hour . Then remove the cheesecake from the mold and transfer it to a plate. Sprinkle the cream with brown sugar .
Now, using a torch, caramelize the sugar to obtain the crunchy layer . Serve your cheesecake immediately .
You can store the cheesecake in the refrigerator for 2 days.
We recommend caramelizing the sugar just before serving for a crunchier crust. Instead of a torch, it is not possible to use the oven grill; the cheesecake might melt as it heats up.
