instructions:
To prepare the risotto with pumpkin cream and pecorino, start by cleaning the carrot, celery, and onion for the broth . Place the vegetables in a large pot, cover with water, and season with peppercorns and cloves . Turn on the heat and cook for about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the Pecorino cream: in a small pot, pour the cream, grated pecorino , and Parmigiano Reggiano PDO.
Bring to a boil, stirring with a whisk . When the cheese has melted, remove the pot from the heat and blend with an immersion blender to obtain a smooth and velvety cream .
Move on to the pumpkin cream: clean and slice half an onion , then in a pan, pour a drizzle of oil, the cherry tomatoes , and whole chili peppers .
Continue with the onion and sage , salt and pepper . Let it sauté over moderate heat.
Meanwhile, clean the pumpkin: remove the seeds , peel the skin , and cut into cubes .
Add the pumpkin and the butter , season with salt and cover with a lid . Cook for about 20 minutes on low heat.
Once the pumpkin is ready, remove the sage, pepper, and cloves . Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add the cream and a ladle of the vegetable broth .
Season with curry and blend with an immersion blender , then adjust the salt .
Strain the cream through a sieve to make it smoother ; if you prefer, you can skip this step. Prepare the rice: in a saucepan, melt the butter and oil .
Add the rice, salt, and let it toast until the grains are hot . Meanwhile, retrieve the broth you have prepared and strain it .
The broth is ready , pour it gradually into the rice to cook it . After about 6-7 minutes, also incorporate the pumpkin cream and finish cooking.
When the rice is ready, stir in the cheese and butter and mix everything. Serve the risotto with pumpkin cream immediately, garnished with pecorino cream, sage leaves, toasted hazelnuts, and coffee powder !
We recommend consuming the risotto with pumpkin cream and pecorino immediately. If there is any leftover, you can store it in the fridge for a couple of days, without the pecorino cream.
You can use cumin or ginger, fresh or powdered, as an alternative to curry.
