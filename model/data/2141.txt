instructions:
To prepare the milk chocolate ganache, pour the cream into a saucepan and bring it to a simmer. Meanwhile, finely chop the milk chocolate and transfer it to a bowl. When the cream starts to boil, pour it over the chocolate in 3 parts , stirring vigorously. Wait for the first addition of cream to be absorbed before adding the second and then the third. Keep the remaining cream from the various pours warm on very low heat.
When you have achieved a smooth and homogeneous consistency, add the softened butter little by little and blend with an immersion blender to get a smoother texture; alternatively, you can continue to stir with a spatula until the butter melts gradually. Your milk chocolate ganache is now ready .
Store the ganache cream in the refrigerator for a maximum of 2-3 days, well covered. If left at room temperature, it can be kept for a maximum of 1 day.
If you want to achieve a solid consistency cream, decrease the amount of cream; if you want to achieve a sort of glaze, you can slightly increase it.
