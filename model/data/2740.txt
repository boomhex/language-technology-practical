Petit beurre biscuits are like that classic treat you just can't resist—seriously good stuff—from the heart of French snack time. These French butter cookies became all the rage thanks to the Lefèvre-Utile factory in Nantes, way back in the late 1800s. And guess what? They've been a hit ever since.
The real charm of a petit beurre recipe is all about that crisp, golden snap and the buttery taste that hits you the second you take a bite. It's a thing. People all over France—and, really, all around the world—know these biscuits for their special square shape and neat, scalloped edges.
And you know what? Folks usually reach for a homemade petit beurre at breakfast, dipping them into a cup of warm milk or coffee—where they get just soft enough without falling apart. That crunchy texture is so, so good.
And here's the thing: these great biscuits sometimes get dressed up with a layer of dark chocolate, adding a little extra sweet and rich taste for those afternoon snack cravings. Even though these traditional French biscuits started in Nantes, you'll now find all kinds of regional spins. Like versions with more salt or local French butter for a deeper flavor.
And look, people have taken the simple butter cookie recipe and made it their own, but that simple, almost melt-in-your-mouth feel stays the same. Across Europe, petit beurre biscuits are a go-to snack for kids and adults. Because, frankly, they’re not too sweet and just right for pairing with everything from fruit to ice cream.
The way these petit beurre biscuits mix a light, crisp bite with a comforting, buttery flavor makes them a snack that works pretty much any time of day. Whether you’re dunking them, stacking them, or just grabbing a handful to munch on, there’s a reason the authentic petit beurre is still a favorite after all these years. Can’t go wrong. Perfect for any occasion, these biscuits continue to be a treat, no question.
To make petit beurre, place the butter, milk , and sugar in a saucepan, and melt everything over low heat, stirring with a spoon , then let it cool.
In a bowl, sift the flour and baking powder , add the melted butter and milk mixture to the dry ingredients , and mix with a spoon to combine the powders . When you have obtained a homogeneous dough,
transfer it to a floured work surface and knead it quickly with your hands to form a dough ball. It will be very soft, cover it with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to firm up for at least 4 hours. The dough is very soft and needs time to harden. After the resting time, take the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured surface to create a sheet about 1/8 inch thick, using a wavy-edged rectangular cookie cutter measuring approximately 2.36x2 inches .
Place the cookies on a baking sheet and refrigerate for 1 hour. After this time, take the cookies and stamp the name petit beurre in the center with a cookie stamp . Bake the cookies in a preheated static oven at 320°F for 12 minutes (if using a convection oven, bake at 285°F for 6-8 minutes). They should not darken too much but only lightly color at the edges. Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack . Your traditional petit beurre are ready. If you want to make chocolate petit beurre, melt the dark chocolate in the microwave or a double boiler .
Pour the melted chocolate into rectangular silicone molds the same size as the cookies and set aside a couple of tablespoons to help the chocolate adhere to the cookie. Let the molds firm up in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or until solid. Remove the chocolate molds and attach them to the cookie by brushing the surface with the melted chocolate (14-15). Now you can finally enjoy your homemade petit beurre!
Store the chocolate-covered cookies in the refrigerator, while those without coating can be stored in a tin box for up to 5 days.
The petit beurre dough is very soft, so work it quickly to avoid overheating. You can find the petit beurre mold set in pastry shops, or you can alternatively use a rectangular cutter to cut the cookies. For the coating, you can simply dip half of the cookies in melted chocolate and let them cool on a tray lined with parchment paper.
