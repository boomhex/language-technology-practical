instructions:
To make the poured cake with apricot jam cream, first, pour the sugar and whole eggs into a large bowl. Blend the mixture with electric beaters until it becomes frothy and light;
at this point, pour the milk , the seed oil , and sift the flour through a sieve
and the baking powder. Add a pinch of salt and continue mixing the ingredients with the whisk until they are blended . Now pour half of the batter into a 9-inch diameter round cake pan greased and lined with parchment paper on the bottom and sides (9-10).
Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 15 minutes. In the meantime, pour the amaretti into the mixer and finely chop them .
In a bowl, add the well-drained ricotta and sugar , add the chopped amaretti and the eggs .
Finally, add the jam and blend everything with the whisk for a smooth cream . Take the baked cake back,
pour the ricotta cream on top , level the surface with a spatula, and pour the remaining batter (20-21). Place back in the oven and bake for another 45 minutes at the same temperature.
When cooking is complete, take the cake out of the oven , let it cool, then unmold it and garnish the surface with powdered sugar . The poured cake with apricot jam cream is ready to be enjoyed !
The poured cake with apricot jam cream can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days.
Drain the ricotta well so that it is dry, otherwise, it will release water during cooking. The apricot jam can be replaced with another jam or marmalade, and the amaretti can be replaced with ladyfingers or dry biscuits.
