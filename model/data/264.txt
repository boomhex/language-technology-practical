instructions:
To make the savory pie with leeks and brie, first prepare the base: in a bowl, add the flour and salt , then add the cold cubed butter and work quickly with your fingertips to obtain a crumbly mixture .
Add the egg and knead further, then pour in the cold water and work until fully absorbed .
When you have obtained a smooth and homogeneous dough ball, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. In the meantime, clean the leeks: remove the ends and the green part, then cut them in half lengthwise and slice thinly .
Heat a swirl of oil in a pan, then add the leeks , salt, and pepper . Cook over medium heat for about 15 minutes, until softened . Turn off the heat and let cool.
Meanwhile, prepare the filling: cut the brie into cubes without removing the rind . Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat with a hand whisk, then add the cream .
Add the cubed cheese to the mixture , season with salt, pepper, and mix with a spoon. Finally, add the cooled leeks and combine it all .
At this point, take the dough from the fridge, place it between 2 sheets of parchment paper, and roll it out with a rolling pin to about a 1/5-inch thickness . Transfer the dough with the parchment paper to an 11-inch diameter pan, then even out the edge with a knife and poke the base with a fork .
Pour the filling into the mold and level the surface , then bake in a static oven at 355°F for about 55 minutes. Remove from the oven and let it slightly cool before serving your savory pie with leeks and brie !
The savory pie with leeks and brie can be stored in the fridge for 2 days, in an airtight container.
Freezing the savory pie is not recommended, but you can freeze the dough if desired.
If you prefer, you can replace the brie with taleggio for a bolder flavor!
