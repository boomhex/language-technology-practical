instructions:
To prepare the lasagna with lentil ragù, start with the béchamel: pour the milk into a saucepan, add the nutmeg and salt, then heat it up. Put the butter in another saucepan and let it melt over low heat, then add the flour all at once .
Mix with a hand whisk until you get a golden mixture. At this point, dilute the roux by pouring in a little hot milk first, then the rest . Continue to mix over low heat until the béchamel thickens . Set it aside to cool.
Prepare the lentil ragù: wash, trim, and chop celery , carrot , and onion for the sauté.
In a large pot, pour some oil and the chopped vegetables for the sauté ; let them brown for about 10 minutes, stirring often. Then add the tomato paste and ground ginger .
Let the base briefly flavor and pour in the lentils . Mix and cover with tomato passata , adding water to cover it completely.
Fragrance with some sage leaves , cover with a lid and let it cook gently for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding water if needed. Towards the end of cooking, adjust the salt and pepper.
Cut the provola into very thin and irregular slices and start composing the lasagna. In a baking dish for 4-6 people, distribute a thin layer of béchamel at the base , then proceed with a layer of lasagna (3 sheets, slightly overlapped) , continue with a thin layer of béchamel .
Pour over abundant ragù , some provola, and a sprinkle of Parmesan . Continue with another layer of pasta sheets .
Continue creating a total of 3 layers. On the last layer, distribute abundant ragù , avoiding provola, and instead add lots of grated Grana Padano . Complete with a sprinkle of pepper
and a drizzle of oil on the surface . Cook in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about half an hour, adding a few minutes of grill for extra browning if needed! The lasagna with lentil ragù is ready to be served .
The lasagna with lentil ragù can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
