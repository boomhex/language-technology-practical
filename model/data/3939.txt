To prepare the horseradish sauce, wash a very fresh and tender horseradish root under running water , dry it well , and scrape it with a knife
Once you have completely cleaned it grate it finely and place it in a bowl. Cut the crusts off the slices of sandwich bread
and break the crumb into pieces then add it in a bowl with the grated horseradish . Pour the white vinegar ,
then also add the olive oil , the sugar , and a pinch of salt
Knead with your hands carefully to mix the ingredients and your horseradish sauce is ready . You can serve it in bowls to accompany, for example, Piedmontese boiled meat, perhaps decorated with some horseradish shavings .
If you want to preserve the sauce for a long time, even for several weeks, you should keep it in the refrigerator in a glass container and cover its surface with a layer of olive oil. Keep in mind that the longer it sits, the more the characteristic flavor that the sauce had when freshly prepared will fade.
The particularly pungent aroma of the horseradish root is reminiscent of mustard; horseradish, or 'barbaforte', is generally used grated, and its tender leaves can also be consumed mixed in salads. In ancient times, the horseradish root (already known to the Romans) was used fresh for therapeutic purposes to combat rheumatic pains and bruises.
Raw or cooked, grated and seasoned with vinegar, salt, cream, and eggs, the horseradish root is wonderful served with grilled meat, fish, or boiled eggs. Or, again, mixed with mayonnaise: it gives it a certain phenomenal something! Remember to add bread (grated or crumb): it softens the otherwise very strong and spicy flavor.
