instructions:
To make the savory strudel with Asiago PDO, broccoli, and sausage, first prepare the dough: pour the flour and salt into a bowl , then add the egg and the oil .
Add the water as well and start mixing the dough in the bowl , then transfer it to the work surface and knead until smooth and homogeneous .
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for an hour . In the meantime, clean the Romanesco broccoli: remove the central stalk , then separate the florets , dividing the larger ones in half so that they are all the same size.
Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and blanch the florets for 3 minutes , then drain and set aside .
Move on to the sausage: remove the casing and break it into pieces about 1 inch long . In a pan, sauté 2 cloves of garlic with a drizzle of oil , then brown the sausage over high heat for a few minutes .
Once browned, remove the garlic and set the sausage aside . Leave the cooking juices in the pan and add the blanched broccoli . Salt, pepper , and sauté these as well for a few minutes.
Once sautéed , set the broccoli aside in a bowl. At this point, cut the Asiago PDO first into slices and then into cubes about 0.5 inches .
Retrieve the bowl with the broccoli and add the sausage , fennel seeds , and fresh thyme leaves .
Add the cubed Asiago PDO as well and mix everything together . At this point, retrieve the dough and sprinkle a cloth with some flour .
Roll out the dough with a rolling pin to form a rectangle about 12x16 inches , then distribute the filling, being careful to flatten it evenly and leave a 1-inch border on each side . Fold the short sides inward and start rolling from the bottom to the top .
After forming the roll , transfer it to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. In a small bowl, mix the egg yolk with the cream , then brush the surface of the roll with the mixture obtained .
Finally, garnish with poppy and fennel seeds and bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for 40 minutes . Once cooked, remove from the oven and serve your savory strudel with Asiago PDO, broccoli, and sausage while still hot !
The savory strudel with Asiago, broccoli, and sausage can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days, closed in an airtight container. It is recommended to reheat it in the oven before serving.
If you prefer, you can replace the fennel seeds with sunflower, sesame, or flax seeds!
