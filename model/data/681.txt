To make Chinese pancakes with scallion, start with the dough. In a bowl, pour the flour , salt , and start to pour a part of the water .
Mix with chopsticks , or alternatively with a fork, and continue pouring the water slowly. You should obtain a dough that is not too smooth, ensuring the water is well absorbed . Then transfer the dough onto a work surface .
Don't worry if it seems very sticky, it's normal. Work it with your hands for 10-15 minutes ; if it becomes difficult, use a dough scraper. Transfer the dough into a greased bowl . Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.
At this point, chop the green part of a scallion and set it aside. Then prepare the emulsion. In a bowl, pour the water, oil , and flour .
Mix always with chopsticks or with a fork, until you get a homogeneous mixture. Take the rested dough and transfer it onto a lightly floured surface; also flour the surface .
Form a cylinder and divide it into 4 equal parts . Take the first portion and flatten it with your hands .
Moisten your hands in the emulsion and flatten the dough again until you get a thin rectangle. Then sprinkle with scallion .
Gently roll the edges of the longer side , bringing them inward to form a small cylinder . Then roll it up from the other side .
You should form a swirl . Gently press it down with your hands , adding flour as needed. You should obtain a thin disc .
Continue this way until you form all 4 of your pancakes . Now move on to cooking, heat a slightly larger pan with a little oil. Place the first pancake inside , brush it with the emulsion and cook until it is nicely golden. Then turn it over .
Brush it again with the prepared emulsion and continue cooking . Cook the others as well and serve your Chinese pancakes .
We recommend serving the Chinese pancakes just made, but if there are leftovers you can store them in the fridge for 1-2 days and warm them up before serving.
If you prefer, instead of scallion, you can use chives, also cut into rings!
