To prepare spiced cookies with chocolate and almonds, start by finely chopping the almonds and chocolate , then place them in a bowl and add cinnamon and ground cloves .
Beat the egg white to stiff peaks with a pinch of salt, then add the sugar one tablespoon at a time, continuing to beat with the electric mixer. Combine the egg white mixture with the other ingredients and mix until the ingredients are well combined: it should be a rather stiff dough. Preheat the oven to 265°F. With the dough obtained, form balls the size of a walnut ; to prevent the mixture from sticking to your palms during this operation, wet them with cold water. Place the balls (you will get about 20) on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, spacing them about 1.5 inches apart and bake them for about 30 minutes at 265°F (as soon as the surface of the cookies starts to crack and harden). After the necessary time, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool, then you are ready to serve them or store them in a tin box.
You can prepare these spiced chocolate cookies by also replacing the almonds with chopped hazelnuts or walnuts.
