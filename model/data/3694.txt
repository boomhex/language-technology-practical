the apple cider vinegar , the Tabasco , and the brown sugar . Wait for it to return to a boil.
Then add the ketchup , mustard and wasabi , the Jack Daniel's , and let it simmer for about 35/40 minutes over very low heat, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and let it cool completely before storing in the fridge. The sauce keeps for a few weeks.
