instructions:
To make the quick ricotta and berry cheesecake, start by chopping the praline hazelnuts irregularly, so that some are finely chopped and some more coarsely . Also chop the cranberries and dried figs .
Finally, crush the dates with the back of a knife to turn them into a paste . Gather everything in a bowl and mix with your hands, pressing to obtain a pasty crumble. Add a pinch of Maldon salt and set aside.
Sift the goat ricotta , which you will have drained over a sieve for a couple of hours. Add the yogurt and powdered sugar , then mix thoroughly.
You should obtain a smooth cream without lumps . Now you can assemble the dessert: take 4 single-serving jars with a capacity of about 6 oz, distribute a layer of crumble on the bottom, pressing the mixture well with the back of a spoon . Add a layer of ricotta cream reaching halfway up the jar.
Now cover with the berries and then with a final layer of cream . Level the edge with a spatula to obtain a smooth surface.
Now garnish with more crumble, some berries , and a pinch of salt . The quick ricotta and berry cheesecakes are ready, you can enjoy them immediately or let them set in the fridge for an hour if you prefer .
The quick ricotta and berry cheesecakes keep in the fridge for a couple of days. We do not recommend freezing.
If you want to add a biscuity element to the base of the cheesecake, you can incorporate some crumbled digestive or cocoa biscuits. For a milder taste, Greek yogurt can be replaced with fresh whipped cream.
