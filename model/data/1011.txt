instructions:
To prepare the loaf bread, start with the dough. Pour the fresh yeast into room temperature water and mix to dissolve it completely . In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, add the flour
and the water with the yeast . Start the mixer at low speed to mix all the ingredients well until you have a smooth and homogeneous mixture . At this point, add the butter little by little, ensuring it is completely absorbed before adding more .
When the butter is well absorbed , add the salt and oil .
Continue to work until the dough completely detaches from the sides of the bowl and is well hooked to the dough hook . Pour the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and work it quickly to shape it into a ball ,
then transfer it to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature for about 1.5 hours. After the rising time , grease a 10x4x4 inch loaf pan and its lid well .
Pour the risen dough onto the lightly floured work surface , stretch it with your hands to make a rectangle 10 inches wide , and then roll it onto itself, stretching the dough .
You should get a loaf of the same length as the mold . Place the loaf in the mold , close with the lid , and let it rise at room temperature for about 2 hours.
When the dough has reached the edge of the mold (visible from the holes in the lid), bake the bread in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 40 minutes with the lid closed. The bread will be ready when it reaches an internal temperature of 205°F, measured with a probe. If you don't have a probe, lift the mold carefully, knock underneath it, and if it sounds hollow, it's cooked. If unsure, you can continue cooking for another 5-10 minutes. Once cooked, remove the mold from the oven and take off the lid . Wait for the bread to be warm before removing it from the mold and letting it cool completely on a wire rack .
Loaf bread can be stored at room temperature in a paper bag for 1 day. Alternatively, you can store it in the refrigerator in a paper bag for 4 days. It can be frozen after baking, preferably sliced.
It is possible to add sunflower, pumpkin, flax, poppy, or sesame seeds to the white loaf bread.
