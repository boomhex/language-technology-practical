Sourdough bread sandwiches, seriously good, are a staple in Italy. They bring that crunchy, artisan vibe, straight to your kitchen. And here's the thing: made with liquid sourdough—or lievito madre —this bread is lighter. It has that subtle tang, which is perfect with all kinds of fillings. Really, it works great.
Using high-gluten Manitoba flour? It ensures the dough rises beautifully during long, slow fermentation. And I gotta say, traditional techniques—like reinforcing folds instead of mixers—give it that perfect texture. The result? A bread with a thick crust and those large, open pockets. You know, the kind you see from Milan to Palermo. No wonder these sourdough sandwich recipes are loved for generations. Pretty much!
The bread stays moist for days. It can handle anything—from simple cheese to hearty Italian cold cuts. All across Italy, there are different takes. Think thyme-infused timo loaves, rustic pumpkin seed breads, or even baguette-inspired adaptations. Each one makes easy sourdough sandwiches feel new every time.
Biting into these sourdough bread sandwiches offers the best mix. A crispy crust with a soft, chewy center. And the fillings? They just change everything. Some folks stick with prosciutto and sharp cheese, while others go for roasted veggies or a gooey sourdough grilled cheese . Really, it's way way better than expected. The bread stands firm—sturdy but with a tender crumb that makes each bite special.
Italian bakers take real pride in their bread's longevity. Plus, the flavor just gets better with time. It is easy to make homemade sourdough sandwiches even days later.

To prepare the sourdough rolls, start with the dough: pour the flour , the refreshed and doubled starter , and half of the water into a large bowl.
Begin kneading with your hands , then add the remaining water and knead again with your hands .
When the water is absorbed, transfer the dough onto a work surface and continue kneading until you have a smooth and elastic dough. At this point, add the salt and continue kneading vigorously for at least 10 minutes until the dough is smooth .
Place it in a bowl previously brushed with oil , cover with plastic wrap , and let it rise for at least 12 hours at a temperature of 70-73°F .
After the necessary time, transfer the dough onto a lightly floured work surface, gently spread it out , and divide it in two . Take the first piece and fold the top edge towards the center .
Then fold the bottom edge towards the center , then do the same with the right edge and the left edge . This way, you've given 4 strengthening folds.
Do the same for the second piece , cover with a cloth , and let it rest for 30 minutes. Give four more folds to each and let it rest covered with a cloth for about 30 minutes. After the necessary time, take one of the pieces and flatten it slightly with your hands .
Cut it into four equal parts and transfer the rolls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them well. Let them rise for an hour , then take a little flour and sprinkle it over the rolls .
Then gently remove the excess flour by brushing it off with your hand . Bake the sourdough rolls in a preheated static oven at 464°F, placing a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven. Bake for about 40 minutes, then take them out and let them cool before serving .
You can store the rolls for 2-3 days in a paper bag. Alternatively, you can freeze them after baking.
If you want to use solid sourdough instead of liquid, add 2 tablespoons of water.
