instructions:
To make ginger and turmeric taralli, start by preparing the dough: put the flour in a bowl and add the salt , ginger , and turmeric ;
then pour in the white wine and the extra virgin olive oil and mix with your hands to combine all the ingredients well .
Transfer the mixture to a work surface and knead quickly until you get a smooth and uniform dough, then wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. After the resting time, take the dough and divide it into rather small pieces ;
roll the pieces of dough with your fingers until you get sticks about 0.4 inches thick and about 3 inches long . Join and overlap the ends of each stick to form a drop shape
and place the formed taralli on a lightly floured cloth . Now bring a pot of water to a boil and cook a few taralli at a time ; when they float to the surface, drain them with a slotted spoon and place them gently on an absorbent cloth .
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 392°F in static mode. At this point, transfer the boiled taralli to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, well spaced apart , and bake them in the preheated oven at 392°F for about 25-30 minutes, or until they are lightly golden . Your ginger and turmeric taralli are ready to be crunched !
Ginger and turmeric taralli can be stored in a tin box for a week. It's possible to freeze the dough or the tarallini already formed before boiling.
If you like spices, don't skimp on the doses: you can slightly increase the amount of ginger to enhance its spiciness and maybe even add a pinch of chili pepper if you're feeling bold!
