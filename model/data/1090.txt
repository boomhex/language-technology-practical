If you're looking to enjoy a taste of Liguria , you gotta try making focaccia with onions and stracchino . Really, this dish shows off why snacks from this northern Italian region are so well-loved. Seriously good. Focaccia is a staple here, and this version with sweet onions and creamy stracchino cheese is a must-try.
The bread comes out soft and a bit chewy, with golden edges—thanks to a good drizzle of olive oil. And the stracchino cheese ? It gives it that gooey, slightly tangy layer that melts perfectly into the dough, pairing beautifully with the tender onions. A sprinkle of rosemary and sea salt takes the flavor up a notch. For real, it is got that herby, fresh taste.
Plus, this isn’t a heavy or complicated bread. People love it because you don't need to deal with tricky fermentation or fancy tools. Pretty simple. The focus is on easy, moist bread that’s perfect for snacking, sharing, or part of an aperitivo spread.
In Liguria, ideas for the onion and stracchino focaccia recipe are everywhere—especially near bakeries in Genoa or along the coast. What’s great is how customizable it is: some folks add olives, others sprinkle more herbs, and a few even mix it with elements of focaccia di Recco or other regional twists.
However you make it, this Italian focaccia with stracchino is ideal for any casual get-together, lunch, or afternoon snack. Eat it warm for that melt-in-your-mouth cheese pull, or enjoy it cold when the flavors have settled and the onions are extra sweet. Whether you call it homemade focaccia with onions or just a really really good piece of bread, the way these simple flavors come together makes it a favorite.
You get the best of classic Italian baking—crisp edges, moist center, and those little hints of olive oil and rosemary that make every bite feel just right. It's the kind of food that’s easy to make and even easier to love, whether you’re a seasoned cook or just starting out in the kitchen. No question.
To prepare the focaccia with onions and stracchino, pour the yeast , sugar , and room temperature water into a large bowl.
Mix with a fork to dissolve everything well . Start gradually adding the two types of flour and mix little by little with a fork . When the mixture begins to compact, add the oil
and incorporate it, always stirring with the fork . Then add the salt and the remaining flour .
Knead with your hands until you get a homogeneous mixture , then transfer it to a surface and continue kneading . Once you have obtained a smooth dough, place it in a slightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature.
After 2 hours, peel the onions and slice them , without separating the rings. After the rising time, take the dough that has now doubled and turn it onto a previously oiled 10x12 inch baking sheet. Spread the focaccia with well-oiled hands .
Once you have covered the entire surface of the baking sheet , add the stracchino and the onions on top .
Let it rise again for 20 minutes . After this time, season with a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of oil . Bake the focaccia in a static oven preheated to 392°F for 20-25 minutes. Take the focaccia out of the oven and let it cool slightly before serving!
The focaccia keeps for 1-2 days in a paper bag. It can be frozen once cooked and cooled, to then thaw and heat as needed.
Enrich the focaccia by adding black olives on top!
