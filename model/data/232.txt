Like any traditional dish, pancotto with turnip tops lends itself to various interpretations. One of the most common variations includes the addition of an egg: you can cook it directly in the soup or add it poached to make the recipe even richer and more substantial.
For a saltier kick, you can sauté a garlic clove with anchovies in oil and then add it to the vegetables before adding the bread.
