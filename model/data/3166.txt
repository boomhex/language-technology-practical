Busy parents like how Pandoro and Nutella Cake solves a lot of dessert dilemmas—works as a no-bake dessert (so you’re not fighting for oven space) and offers an easy, make-ahead option for big family groups. Excellent for those "Pandoro vs Panettone" talks—this Italian Christmas dessert puts tradition and modern simplicity together, keeping kids and adults happy during any get-together. Plenty of freedom for serving, too: some slice it thick and add a little whipped cream on top, others stack the pieces for that classic tree look. Sometimes pistachio cream or orange zest gets mixed in, especially if you want your own favorite spin. Great with coffee, hot chocolate, or just some milk—pretty much whatever the family wants. With that cozy seasonal taste, nice rich texture, and crowd-friendly appeal as a Nutella dessert , it’s a cake that pretty much ensures your big holiday or family dinner has its SWEETEST happy ending.
To prepare the Pandoro and Nutella® cake, roll out the pandoro slices with a rolling pin to about 1/5 inch . Cut one of them with a 7-inch ring, place the same ring on a tray lined with parchment paper. Place the cut slice inside to serve as the base. Cut the other rolled-out pandoro slice into strips about 2 inches wide, trim the uneven ends to even them out and line the edge of the ring with them . To fill: soak the gelatin in cold water for at least 10 minutes. In a bowl, pour the mascarpone and powdered sugar .
add the honey, grated zest of half a lemon and half an orange , and also add 200 ml (about 3/4 cup) of fresh liquid cream. Mix the ingredients with an electric mixer until you obtain a smooth cream. Heat the remaining 20 ml (about 1 tbsp) of fresh liquid cream and the drained and gently wrung gelatin in a saucepan : dissolve the gelatin very well.
Pour everything onto the mascarpone cream and mix for a few seconds with the electric mixer. Once ready , pour the mascarpone and cream mixture into the mold
and level the surface with a spatula . Transfer the cake to the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Once set , start decorating with Nutella® placed in a pastry bag with a ribbed nozzle: create a spiral to cover the entire surface, starting from the center and making concentric circles .
Once completely covered , decorate with dollops of whipped cream, placed in a pastry bag with a smooth nozzle . Alternate with raspberries ,
blackberries and red currants, finish with myrtle leaves . You can enrich it with pistachio crumbs, some golden sprinkles, and a magical touch: gold powder . Your Pandoro and Nutella® cake is ready to be enjoyed!
Store your Pandoro and Nutella® cake in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
You can also freeze it without decoration.


You can decorate as you prefer: with hazelnut crumbs or halved toasted hazelnuts, you can crumble homemade plain or shortbread cookies instead of gold: less precious but fabulous nonetheless!
