instructions:
To make the potato focaccia with burrata and zucchini flowers, first boil the potatoes starting with cold water for about 30-40 minutes depending on the size . Check the cooking with the prongs of a fork and mash them while still warm . In a large bowl, pour the manitoba flour and re-milled semolina .
Add the crumbled fresh yeast , room temperature water , and mashed potatoes .
Knead the ingredients by hand until you get a homogeneous mixture . Let the dough rest at room temperature for 5 minutes, without covering the bowl, then add the salt and oil .
Work the dough until the oil has been fully absorbed , then make reinforcement folds by lifting the dough with your hands and folding the edges underneath. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise in the oven turned off with the light on for about 2 hours or until doubled in volume .
After the rising time , oil a 12x16 inch pan well. Turn the dough inside and gently stretch it with your hands until it covers the entire surface .
Wash the zucchini and slice it into thin slices about 1/8 inch thick using a mandoline . Place the zucchinis on the dough and let rise for another 30 minutes away from drafts
After this time, drizzle the surface with a little oil and sprinkle with fleur de sel . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F on the middle rack for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, wash and clean the zucchini flowers, leaving them whole .
Once cooked, take the focaccia out of the oven and garnish with the zucchini flowers, then distribute the burrata tufts on the surface . Bake again for 2-3 minutes, then pepper and let cool slightly before enjoying your potato focaccia with burrata and zucchini flowers !
The potato focaccia with burrata and zucchini flowers can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days.
The focaccia dough can be frozen after the first rise and thawed in the refrigerator; then it should be brought back to room temperature and allowed to rise in the pan as indicated in the steps. It can then be baked with the times and temperature indicated in the recipe.
If you prefer, you can enrich the potato focaccia with black olives or anchovies, like in our focaccia with anchovies, zucchini flowers, and burrata!
