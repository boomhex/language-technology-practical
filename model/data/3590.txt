Bright color and a crispy edge give potato cakes with peanut sauce that irresistible, homey vibe everyone looks for—families usually spot these llapingachos right away on the table thanks to their fluffy shape and golden finish. Each mashed potato patty comes stuffed with melted cheese inside, so every bite combines the best of both textures—perfect match of smooth, warm center with a crisp, browned outside. DECADENT but still really easygoing , these Ecuadorian recipes always grab attention at parties, family brunches, or relaxed weeknight dinners. Double the appeal arrives with that classic peanut sauce drizzled on top (salsa de mani, you’ll hear it called), which adds a sweet and savory combination and round, nutty flavor that surprises everyone. This is the type of dish that looks and smells little bit special—but fits right in everywhere from kids’ lunches to big family celebrations.
Busy families love how these potato and cheese combination dishes hit all the marks for comfort, fun, and versatility. Pick them up with your hands or use a fork—kids don’t mind either way! The cheese patties never overpower, so they blend SUPER well on the plate with all kinds of South American favorites and simple weeknight sides (green salad, grilled chicken, or roasted veggies work great). Fans of traditional South American cuisine often say the hint of nutty peanut sauce makes a huge difference, giving each bite a little something extra that most kids and adults go back for again and again. Thanks to that nice, fluffy texture and familiar taste, gatherings feel warmer and everyone gets just what they like…modern, adaptable, and ideal for anyone who likes great, satisfying , cozy food. Set out extra toppings or extras—these tend to disappear pretty fast. Simple comfort, a little Ecuadorian fun, and a dish people really, truly enjoy together—more than once!
Peel the potatoes and cut them into chunks, place them in a pot with cold water and a pinch of salt, and cook until they are tender, about 20 minutes. Prepare the sauce: finely chop shallots and garlic, heat oil in a pan and sauté until golden, add the cumin and let the aromas release ; add the tomato cut into chunks and deseeded, cook for a couple of minutes over low heat. Add the milk and simmer for two minutes; keep warm.
Drain the potatoes and mash them with a potato masher ; keep warm. Heat a tablespoon of peanut oil in the pan and add the onion , sauté for a couple of minutes, then drain off the oil.
and add the mashed potatoes and grated cheese , cook for a moment and then transfer to a bowl
take a tablespoon of the mixture at a time and form flat cakes with the help of your hands , coat them well in cornmeal so they remain crispy when cooked.
Heat 2-3 tablespoons of peanut oil in a pan and cook 4 cakes at a time, 3-4 minutes per side, turning them only once. Meanwhile, add a tablespoon of peanut butter to the sauce and heat it briefly over very low heat. Drain the potato cakes on a paper towel and serve them with the sauce still warm.
