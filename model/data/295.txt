instructions:
To prepare boiled carrots, the first thing to do is to place a pot full of salted water on the stove. Wash the carrots, peel them , and trim them. Then cut them into slices about 1/4 inch thick and collect them in a bowl as you go.
As soon as the water reaches a boil, plunge in the carrots and cook them for 4-5 minutes if you prefer crunchier carrots, or 7-8 minutes if you prefer them softer. Meanwhile, fill a bowl with water and ice. As the carrots reach the consistency you prefer, drain them and transfer them to the bowl . This will stop the cooking and make them a bright color.
Drain them again , transfer them to a tray lined with paper towels , and dry them well with more paper towels .
Transfer them again to a dry bowl and meanwhile prepare the sauce. In a tall and narrow container, pour the soy sauce and lemon juice .
Add the tahini , powdered ginger , and sesame oil .
Finally, add the water and blend everything with an immersion blender until you get a smooth, creamy sauce .
Plate the carrots by placing the sauce on top ; add sesame seeds and the green part of the scallion sliced .
Boiled carrots can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of 1-2 days. You can freeze the carrots after cooking without the sauce.
Instead of the sauce that we proposed, you can simply dress the carrots with oil and lemon juice, or a teaspoon of vinegar. Instead of sesame oil, you can use extra virgin olive oil.
