instructions:
To prepare the risotto with bell peppers, peanuts, and cheese, wash the bell peppers, remove the cap , and then cut them in half lengthwise. Open them up and remove the seeds and filaments . Salt a grill pan, and when it's hot, roast the bell peppers and garlic , turning them occasionally, without being afraid to char the skin.
When they are soft and smoky , remove them from the heat, place them in a container , and cover with plastic wrap. Let them cool down .
Grind the peanuts to obtain a coarse powder to set aside. Peel the bell peppers and remove the garlic's skin .
In the same mixer, add the bell peppers, garlic , some mint leaves, salt, chili pepper , and oil .
Add the drained sun-dried tomatoes and blend the mixture . Toast the rice dry , then add salted hot water and continue cooking, adding a little at a time.
When the rice is almost ready, add the bell pepper cream , finish cooking, and off the heat, stir in the Parmigiano Reggiano and add the chopped peanuts .
Grill the tominos on a hot grill for about 2 minutes, then plate the risotto adding a tomino to each portion , some chopped peanuts , chili pepper to taste, and a few mint leaves . The risotto with bell peppers, peanuts, and cheese is ready to be served.
The risotto with bell peppers, peanuts, and cheese can be stored for one day in the refrigerator without the tomino. You can prepare the bell pepper cream in advance and store it in the fridge.
