Bolognese skewers bring a real taste of Emilia-Romagna right to your table, mixing tradition with some seriously good flavor. These aren’t your everyday skewers— Stecchi alla Bolognese recipe goes way back to old-school Bologna. People started making these as a special treat for gatherings and big family meals. Really rich flavors. The way mortadella, emmenthal cheese, and juicy pork loin—or sometimes tender chicken livers and tongue for a throwback to the earliest versions—get stacked on a stick just makes everything taste a little richer and a bit more fun. And the sauce? There’s a layer of creamy béchamel sauce that wraps around each skewer before you roll them in breadcrumbs and fry them up until they’re golden and crispy. That bit of history, mixed with the savory flavors and moist texture inside, is what sets these fried mortadella and cheese skewers apart from other snacks. Honestly, they're fantastic.
In Bologna, these deep-fried treats are a standout part of the local food culture. Artusi, the famous 19th-century Italian food writer, even talked about them in his classic book—so you know they’ve got some serious roots! And look, what people love about deep-fried Italian skewers is how they hit all the right notes: a little salty from the mortadella, a touch of nutty cheese, and that crispy coating that crackles when you bite in. Folks sometimes swap out the fillings depending on what’s on hand. The combo of mortadella and Gruyère (or emmenthal) cheese is a big favorite for modern cooks. These traditional Italian appetizers are usually served hot, right out of the fryer. All those melty flavors come together. Really really tasty.
It’s the kind of food that always shows up at parties, get-togethers, or even just when you want a snack that’s a little different from the usual. When you try the Bolognese skewers , you’ll see why Emilia-Romagna cuisine has such a great reputation. It's for making food that’s both comforting and a little bit special. Whether you’re new to Italian cooking or a seasoned fan, this dish is sure to impress with its rich taste and cultural history. No question.
To prepare Bolognese skewers, start with the béchamel sauce. For the process, you can also refer to the Béchamel sauce sheet. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over low heat, then add the sifted flour . Stir with a spiral or regular whisk to prevent lumps and gradually add the milk in a thin stream . Stir until the béchamel reaches the consistency of a smooth cream . Then add salt, pepper to taste, and a grating of nutmeg. Now that the béchamel is ready, transfer it to a small bowl and let it cool. If you prepare the béchamel for the skewers well in advance, it's advisable to store it in a bowl covered with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out too much. If it thickens excessively, it can be thinned with cold milk, stirring with a whisk.
Proceed now to prepare the skewers: cut the mortadella, Emmental cheese, and pork loin into cubes about half an inch each side, which you will use alternately to prepare the skewers (4-5-6).
In a pan, add a drizzle of olive oil and sauté the pork loin cubes for a few minutes , turning them often to brown all sides (8-9). Remove from the heat and let them cool before starting to assemble the skewers.
Now that you have all the ingredients ready , take 18 skewers and start threading a cube of mortadella, a cube of pork loin , and a cube of cheese onto each, pressing them together well to keep them close. You can choose to place the cheese cube in the middle to reduce the risk of it melting during cooking.
Place the 18 assembled skewers on a plate while you prepare the ingredients for the coating: in a shallow dish or bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt . In another shallow dish or bowl, place the breadcrumbs. You will then have three bowls with the necessary ingredients to "dip" the skewers before frying them .
In order, dip each skewer first in the béchamel sauce you set aside , then in the egg , and finally coat them in the breadcrumbs .
Make sure the skewers are well coated on all sides . Now, fill a large pot with seed oil and heat it to 340-355°F, no higher to prevent the oil from smoking (if you don't have a thermometer, you can crumble a bit of breadcrumbs into the pot and when it sizzles vigorously, the oil is ready for frying). Immerse two or three skewers at a time to avoid lowering the oil temperature and cook them for a few minutes until they are golden brown . The frying must be quick, otherwise, the cheese will melt too much. Drain the Bolognese skewers with a slotted spoon, place them on paper towels, then salt them and serve them very hot !
Bolognese skewers are excellent when consumed hot and crispy. They can be prepared in the morning, stored in the refrigerator, breaded and raw, covered with plastic wrap to be cooked the same day. They can be frozen raw after breading and should be fried while still frozen.
Served piping hot, perhaps accompanied by an Emilia-Romagna Lambrusco, a fizzy red wine that's easy to underestimate (in the sense that it seems light, but then...), Bolognese skewers are one of those dishes that would make anyone's mouth water. First of all, the aroma of mortadella. Then, the interplay of textures: the pork loin (or any other type of meat you choose to use) is more solid, while the Emmental (or Gruyère, or another cheese that doesn't melt at high temperatures) is softer and more melty. What are you waiting for, run to the kitchen to make them!
