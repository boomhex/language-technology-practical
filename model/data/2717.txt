instructions:
To prepare the crispy chicken thighs, start by removing the fattier parts , place the thighs in a bowl and coat them with olive oil to help the breading stick better. Now focus on the breading: chop the rosemary and thyme
and place the chopped herbs in a wide bowl, add the sweet paprika, yellow mustard powder , lemon zest , and orange zest .
Add the yellow cornmeal , garlic powder , salt , pepper, and mix to blend the breading.
Take the chicken thighs and make lengthwise cuts to better absorb the flavors. Coat the thighs in the breading, making sure it sticks on all sides , then place the thighs on a tray .
Heat a skillet over the stove and then place the chicken thighs in it , drizzle with a little oil, and cook over moderate heat for 20 minutes with the lid on, turning them halfway through cooking . Your crispy chicken thighs are ready, enjoy them hot !
They can be stored in the fridge for up to two days when covered, but freezing is discouraged as they will lose their crispiness.
The breading can be enriched with the herbs and flavors you prefer: hot paprika, chili pepper, parsley, or even cumin for those who love exotic flavors!
