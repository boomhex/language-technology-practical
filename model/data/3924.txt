It’s a tasty, familiar dish that keeps everyone happy while letting home bakers enjoy that success only a recipe like easy beef empanadas can bring.
In a fairly large saucepan, fry the meat cut into small pieces together with the sausage and the onion in oil. After a few minutes over medium heat, add the other ingredients and let them brown for a few minutes; if necessary, soften the mixture with a little water so it does not become too dry. In the meantime, prepare the dough with flour, softened lard in a bain-marie, and salt; knead until you obtain a uniform and elastic dough that you will let rest for 30 minutes. Small Panadas Take the dough and start rolling it with a rolling pin to obtain a thin sheet: with a glass, a cup, or a pastry cutter, cut out many discs, an even number. At this point, you can proceed in two ways: using small bowls to place the bottom disc, fill it with filling, cover with the other disc, and close it by pinching the edges inward, or just with your hands, without the help of bowls, place filling on the bottom disc, raise the edges creating small pleats to give the disc a cylindrical shape, cover with another disc of dough like a “lid,” sealing the edges well and pinching them inward. Place the panadas thus obtained on a baking tray and bake at 350°F for 25 minutes; they are ready when the dough is uniformly colored. They should be served hot, but if you wish, you can also pre-cook them, freeze them, and, when you want to enjoy them, reheat them in the oven at a low temperature. Large Panada in a Baking Dish Divide the dough into two parts to roll out into two thin discs, place the first in a round baking dish with high sides that has been previously greased, and fill with the meat and vegetable mixture; cover with the other disc like a lid, sealing the edges. In the center of the tray, make holes with a fork so that the steam can escape easily during cooking. Place the tray in the oven and bake at 350°F for 40 to 60 minutes, until the dough is golden brown.
Since it is a fairly 'versatile' dish, it can also be customized according to personal tastes or particular needs. For example, for those with small children, “sa panada” can be made with turkey or chicken breast.
"Sa panada" (ball), is one of the most well-known Sardinian traditional products, and it is highly appreciated today, as it is made with the basic foods of agro-pastoral life: the shell is made of dough seasoned with lard that hides a filling of cheese, pork, lamb, beef, eel, or even vegetables, all cooked in the oven without the addition of any type of preservatives or additives.
