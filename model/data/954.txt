Latte alla portoghese takes me right back to those old-fashioned Sunday lunches when dessert felt really special. This classic flan is a favorite across Italy, and you know what? It's known for using only milk—no cream—so every bite is delicate, creamy, and not too heavy. It’s often compared to crème caramel , but the Italian version is way smoother. Always made in a big mold, not those little cups. Really. The best part? That thin layer of golden caramel on top gives just the right amount of sweetness with a hint of bitterness to balance the moist custard underneath. Simple yet packed with vanilla and that classic caramel touch Italians love. Pellegrino Artusi even wrote about it, which shows its place in Italian food history.
And listen, up north, some folks swap vanilla for lemon zest or a bit of orange, but the most classic style keeps it pure and straightforward. Families add their own twists, but the heart of this traditional Italian dessert is always the super smooth baked custard and homemade caramel. You might see similar desserts like crema catalana in Spain, but honestly, nothing beats a well-made latte alla portoghese . Around the holidays, this is often the go-to caramel dessert . And it pairs with any meal, no question. Italian gatherings aren’t complete without a big, tender slice to finish things off. Curious about other old-school sweets? Trying this Italian flan is a fun way to taste real tradition—it brings everyone to the table and keeps them coming back for more. It is not just a dish; it's a really really good journey into Italian culinary heritage. Offers a warm wave of flavors. Makes any occasion feel special. Whether you're new to it or revisiting a favorite, latte alla portoghese is sure to charm with its simplicity and elegance, for sure.

When the milk is hot, remove the vanilla bean and add it to the egg mixture , stirring well with the whisk . Set the mixture aside and prepare the caramel.
Pour the water into a saucepan , add the sugar , and place on medium heat until it reaches a nice amber color .
At this point, pour the hot caramel into a ring mold with an upper diameter of 8 inches, lower diameter of 6 inches, and a height of 3 inches . Let it cool for a couple of minutes, then add the egg mixture . Place the mold inside a high-edged baking pan that you will fill with a few inches of water, and bake in a preheated static oven at 320°F for about 75 minutes .
After the cooking time is up , take the Portuguese milk out of the oven and let it cool down, then put it in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Once chilled, carefully unmold it by turning the mold upside down onto a serving plate . Your Portuguese milk is ready to be served !
Portuguese milk can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
To easily unmold Portuguese milk, you can use a few tricks: for example, you can briefly dip the mold in a pot of hot water or warm it by quickly passing a flame over the mold with a blowtorch; this will also prevent the caramel from sticking to the bottom.
You can further flavor your Portuguese milk by adding lemon zest to the milk, which should be removed along with the vanilla bean later.
