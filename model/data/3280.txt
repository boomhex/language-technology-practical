The Fave dei Morti recipe pops up all over Italy as autumn rolls in, especially around All Saints' Day on November 1st and 2nd. And you know what? These special All Souls’ Day cookies have a story. They're believed to be made for the spirits of loved ones who return during this time. Really special. When you bite into these Italian almond cookies , you get this touch of nostalgia. Seriously good. With their simple, round shape and tender, almost moist dough, it’s the ground almonds and pine nuts that do the trick.
Families from Umbria to Veneto have their own twists, but every batch needs a good hit of sugar, cinnamon, and lemon zest. No question. Oh, and let’s not forget the splash of grappa—it gives these cookies a refined edge that sets them apart from other Italian cookies . Perfect for a Halloween bash or just with a cup of coffee.
Thing is, no two batches of Fave dei Morti are ever identical. Every family swears theirs is unbeatable. Some might be a bit more crispy on the outside; others prefer them soft and melt-in-your-mouth. The smell while they’re baking? It fills the house. Really really great. The warm cinnamon blends with the sweet scent of almonds and draws everyone in. Often, you’ll find them as part of a bigger spread of Italian holiday desserts . But trust me, they stand on their own.
There’s this rich history in these little bites, and even if you’re not Italian, they offer a unique treat. Perfect for any fall gathering. Whether you’re into the old legends or just want something sweet and a little different, these All Souls' Day cookies tick every box. They’re more than just cookies—they’re a way to bring a piece of Italian culture and history to your table. And honestly, who doesn't love a good story with their snack?
To prepare the Beans of the Dead, start by finely chopping the almonds in a mixer (be careful not to heat them too much, or they will release oil), and then the pine nuts . In a bowl, beat the egg and yolks with the grappa .
On a floured board, place the flour , the chopped almonds , and sift the powdered sugar . Also add the pine nuts turned into flour and mix the powders with your hands, forming a well in the center.
Finally, add the grated zest of an untreated lemon and the cinnamon . Once all the ingredients are used up, pour the beaten eggs with the grappa into the center of the well and
begin kneading with your hands until you obtain a compact and moldable dough . Cut off one piece of dough at a time and roll it into a sausage shape with a diameter of approximately 3/8 inch, then divide it into pieces also about 3/8 inch wide .
Shape the pieces with your hands to form a round shape and continue until the dough is used up. Place the obtained balls on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake them at 356°F for 15 minutes: they should be just lightly golden on the surface but not too colored . Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool: now you just need to serve your Beans of the Dead to your guests, even those you can't see!
Beans of the Dead can be stored in a tin box or under a glass dome for 4 days.
Instead of chopped almonds, you can use almond flour in the same quantity.
