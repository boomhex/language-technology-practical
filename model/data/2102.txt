To prepare the flatbread with tomatoes and ricotta, start by making the dough. In the bowl of a stand mixer with a hook attachment, pour in the flour and dry yeast , then start the machine by pouring in room temperature water in a stream, setting aside about 100 ml . Once the dough is fairly uniform, add the salt
and the water you set aside , which will help it dissolve perfectly. Continue working until you have a smooth and elastic dough . Then add the rosemary leaves
and work for another 1-2 minutes until the dough is well incorporated . Then transfer it to a work surface , work it with your hands for a few more minutes
and shape the dough into a sphere . Then place it in a rather large bowl, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rise for about 2 hours and 30 minutes in the switched-off oven with just the light on. After about 2 hours, start preparing the ingredients for the topping. First, transfer the ricotta into a bowl and work it with a spatula to soften it .
Add the grated lemon zest , salt , pepper , and mix everything together.
Set the ricotta aside and slice the zucchinis, about 1/8-1/6 inch thick . Then transfer them to a bowl, add salt, pepper, a drizzle of oil , and mix everything together.
Also, slice both types of tomatoes and set aside. Once the dough has doubled in volume , transfer it to a lightly floured countertop, using a dough scraper .
Divide the dough into 6 portions of about 5 oz each ; take two and place the others in the refrigerator, covered with a damp cloth, then on a lightly floured surface, start flattening one with your hands , then roll it out using a rolling pin until you have a sheet about 10x4.5 inches and 1/6 inch thick .
Using your hands or a brush, grease the baking tray where you'll be cooking your flatbreads ; roll out the other one and place both on the tray , then use a brush to oil the surface of the flatbreads and lightly salt.
With the help of a spoon, transfer a bit of ricotta onto each flatbread and level it, covering almost the entire surface but leaving about 1/2 inch free from each edge . Place both types of cherry tomatoes on top of the ricotta
and the zucchini slices. Salt, pepper, and brush the vegetables with oil again . Add a bit more rosemary on the surface and bake in a preheated static oven at 430°F, ensuring the flatbreads are in contact with the oven's bottom for 25 minutes plus 5 minutes in the middle section. Once they are golden, take them out and proceed the same way for the other two pieces of dough, then the last two that you've kept in the fridge. Enjoy them hot or warm, they'll always be delicious!
The flatbreads with ricotta and tomato can be stored for a maximum of 1-2 days in the fridge, covered well; just heat them up before serving.
Once cooked, they can be frozen; when serving, there's no need to defrost them; simply heat them directly in the oven.
Instead of ricotta, you can use melting cheese, such as smoked or mild scamorza. You can use oregano instead of rosemary for flavoring.
If you want, you can prepare the dough the night before and let it rise in the fridge for 8-10 hours. Then leave the dough at room temperature for 2 hours to revive before proceeding with the rest of the preparation.
