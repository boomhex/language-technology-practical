instructions:
To prepare the crunchy pumpkin and cheese focaccia, start with the dough: pour the water, flour , salt , and extra virgin olive oil into the bowl of a stand mixer.
Start the mixer with the hook at medium speed and knead until the mixture is well combined . Let the dough rest at room temperature for 20 minutes, covered with a cloth .
After the resting time, take the dough and divide it with the help of a dough scraper : you should get 2 portions weighing 12.35 oz (for the base) and 2 balls weighing 10.58 oz (for the surface) . Shape each ball on the work surface .
Place the 4 portions of dough on a lightly floured tray , cover with plastic wrap , and let rest in the refrigerator for one hour . Meanwhile, prepare the pumpkin: cut it in half .
Remove the seeds and inner fibers , then peel it and cut the flesh into slices about 0.8 inches thick .
Place the pumpkin in a pan with a swirl of hot oil , then season with salt and pepper .
Season with chopped thyme, sage, and rosemary and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, adding water as needed ; it shouldn't be fully cooked. After cooking, transfer the pumpkin to a baking sheet to let it cool slightly .
Take the dough from the fridge and start rolling out the 12.35 oz portion until you have a sheet the same size as the baking tray : we used a 16x12 inch baking sheet. If the dough shrinks, let it rest for another 5 minutes. Lay the sheet in the baking tray and gently stretch it to cover the edges .
Spread the cooled pumpkin on the focaccia base , then add the stracchino by spoonfuls . Roll out the 10.58 oz portion of dough the same way and use the obtained sheet to cover the focaccia .
Season the surface with herbs, a swirl of oil, and flakes of salt . Finally, make cuts in the top sheet to prevent it from puffing up too much while baking. Bake in a static oven at 482°F for 15 minutes, then switch to fan mode and continue baking for another 5 minutes . Once golden, remove the focaccia from the oven and let it cool slightly before slicing. Your crunchy pumpkin and cheese focaccia is ready to be enjoyed !
The crunchy pumpkin and cheese focaccia can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
You can freeze it after baking and allowing it to cool completely.
If possible, use an iron baking tray to cook the focaccia as it conducts heat better.
The amount of water needed for cooking the pumpkin depends on the type of pumpkin used; some varieties do not need it, while others like the kabocha require a small amount to prevent burning.
Alternatively, you can use other types of cheese like robiola, scamorza, or mozzarella (preferably for pizza) instead of stracchino.
If you don't have a stand mixer, you can knead by hand.
