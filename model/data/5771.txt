To prepare the winter vegetable parmigiana, start by cleaning all the vegetables. They should all be sliced to a thickness of 0.5 cm (1/5 inch) and baked in a preheated static oven at 200°C (390°F) for about half an hour. If you have multiple baking trays, you can cook all the vegetables by switching the trays halfway through cooking, or you can bake them in batches. Begin with the pumpkin. After peeling it and removing the central part, slice it and arrange it on the baking tray, drizzling with olive oil, salt, and pepper. The pumpkin may take about 20-25 minutes, so be sure to keep an eye on the cooking process .
Next, move on to the fennel. Remove the base and outer leaves , then slice and place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, seasoning with olive oil, salt, and pepper .
Do the same for the cauliflower (7-8), keeping in mind that the cooking time might be a bit longer. Finally, proceed with the beetroot. It's recommended to wear gloves while handling it to avoid staining. Remove the skin with a peeler
and slice it . Place it on a baking tray with parchment paper and season with salt, pepper, and olive oil . While all the vegetables are cooking, prepare some thin slices of casera cheese using a grater .
Finally, prepare the aromatic brown butter. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat, adding the aromatic herbs and the clove of garlic in its skin, lightly crushed . As soon as it turns hazelnut brown in color ,
strain it and set it aside . Don't discard the sage; you can chop it and use it later. At this point, the pumpkin , fennel ,
cauliflower , and beetroot should be ready. In a 9x9-inches baking dish, start layering the vegetables ,
creating a uniform layer with all the types . Cover with cabbage leaves and season with a pinch of salt. Finally, add some slices of casera cheese and grated cheese .
Repeat the various layers until you have used all the ingredients (finish the last layer with casera cheese and grated cheese) (25-26), then drizzle with the brown butter .
Sprinkle with chopped fried sage leaves and a pinch of pepper . Bake in a preheated oven for another 35 minutes at 180°C (355°F), and you can finally enjoy your winter vegetable parmigiana .
You can store the winter vegetable parmigiana in the refrigerator for a maximum of 2-3 days. You can prepare the vegetables a few hours in advance, but try not to go much beyond this time because they may change in texture and color. We do not recommend freezing because the vegetables may become softened later on, but if you prefer, you can give it a try.
Chioggia beets, celeriac, carrots, onions, and broccoli: the combinations of vegetables to experiment with in this recipe are endless. Mix colors and textures, but don't forget the basics: roast, don't boil, and layer generously with plenty of cheese. If you can't find Casera cheese to make your winter vegetable parmigiana, you can easily substitute it with a semi-skimmed dairy cheese, a mild Fontina, or a lightly aged Pecorino. A delightful crunch can be added by toasting some nuts in a skillet and placing them between the different layers.
