And the sauce? Pretty much perfect.
To make the savory mini cheesecakes with onions, first prepare the shortcrust for the base: in a bowl, add the flour and ricotta , then add the egg , a few thyme leaves, salt , and pepper.
Knead by hand to get a homogeneous mixture . Roll out the dough on the work surface to a thickness of about 1/4 inch; there is no need to shape the dough in a particular way . Transfer the dough to a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated convection oven at 392°F for about 30 minutes.
In the meantime, melt the butter in a saucepan and set aside. Once the shortcrust has finished baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool. Break the shortcrust roughly and transfer it to a food processor , then blend it into crumbs .
Pour the shortcrust crumbs into a bowl and add the melted, cooled butter , then mix with a spoon or spatula to combine the ingredients . Now line 8 cake rings with acetate sheets and place them on a tray with parchment paper. Distribute the shortcrust mixture inside the cake rings and level it by pressing down with the back of a teaspoon . Let the bases cool in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the ricotta cream: place the ricotta in a bowl and soften it with a hand whisk , then add the oil , salt, and pepper .
Also add the cream , grated Grana cheese , and thyme leaves , then mix everything together with the whisk. If you prefer, you can transfer the cream into a piping bag.
Retrieve the bases from the refrigerator and divide the cream among the cake rings , leveling the surface with the back of a teaspoon . Let it set in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours , covered with plastic wrap.
In the meantime, prepare the caramelized onions: clean and slice the red onions thinly . Cook the onions in a pan with a drizzle of oil over medium-low heat for about 5-7 minutes, then add the brown sugar and water and continue cooking for another 5-6 minutes. Once caramelized , let them cool slightly.
After the setting time, gently unmold the cheesecakes and garnish with a tuft of caramelized onions and a few thyme leaves. Your savory mini cheesecakes with onions are ready to be served !
It is advisable to serve the savory mini cheesecakes with onions immediately. The cheesecake without onions can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can replace Grana cheese with grated Pecorino for a stronger flavor, or season with rosemary instead of thyme.
If you're looking for an alternative to caramelized onions, you can top your savory ricotta mini cheesecakes with zucchini pesto or sun-dried tomatoes!
