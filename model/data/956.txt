instructions:
To prepare the orange risotto with swordfish and shrimp, first, deal with the fish: clean the swordfish by removing the skin and central bone, then cut the flesh into cubes . Shell the shrimp by removing the head and shell , extract the black vein from the back, and chop the flesh with a knife .
Transfer the shrimp to a bowl, add the grated orange zest , oil , salt, and a pinch of chili pepper . Mix well, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate to marinate while you continue with the recipe.
Now clean the leeks and slice them into rounds , then set aside about 2 oz. Sauté the rest of the leeks in a saucepan where you have heated some oil , then add the swordfish and let it season briefly.
Now add the rice and toast it over high heat for a couple of minutes, stirring often . Deglaze with the sparkling wine and let it evaporate completely, then lower the heat and adjust with salt and pepper.
At this point cook the rice by adding the orange juice a little at a time, stirring often and waiting for the liquid to be absorbed before adding more . Meanwhile, heat a generous amount of oil in another pan and fry the leeks set aside , then drain them and transfer them to paper towels to remove excess oil .
When the rice is cooked , turn off the heat, drizzle with raw oil and let it rest for a few minutes. Plate the risotto and complete by adding a spoonful of marinated shrimp in the center of each plate and a handful of fried leeks .
Drizzle with a thread of oil , garnish with chopped parsley , and serve your orange risotto with swordfish and shrimp !
It is recommended to consume the orange risotto with swordfish and shrimp as soon as it is ready.
You can replace 7 oz of sparkling wine with the same amount of vegetable broth. If you want to further scent the risotto with swordfish and shrimp, you can add some grated orange zest at the end!
