To prepare the caprese omelet, first cut the mozzarella into cubes and drain the excess water by placing it between two pieces of paper towels until use . Wash and slice the tomatoes to get about ten slices.
Heat a pan, place the tomato slices , season with salt , and grill for about 1 minute .
Prepare the mixture for the first omelet: in a bowl, add the two whole eggs, season with salt and pepper , and beat them with a whisk . Grease a pan with oil and heat it up.
Pour in the beaten eggs and cover with the lid . As soon as the surface starts to set and bubble, place three tomato slices on one side .
Add half of the well-drained mozzarella , two more tomato slices, and fresh basil . Fold the omelet over itself into a half-moon shape .
Fold well in half and continue cooking on low heat, covering with the lid until the mozzarella has melted . The first omelet is ready; proceed in the same way with the second one. Serve your caprese omelets hot .
It's recommended to consume the caprese omelet immediately.
Stuff with sautéed zucchini or arugula to add raw, and try flavoring the beaten eggs with saffron for a version with spicy notes!
