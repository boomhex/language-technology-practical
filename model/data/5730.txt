instructions:
To prepare the tzatziki sauce, first wash and remove the seeds from the cucumber, if present. Then grate the cucumber with a coarse grater, without removing the peel . Transfer the grated cucumber to a strainer placed over a bowl and let it rest for at least an hour, so that it loses its vegetation water .
After this time, peel the garlic cloves and remove the core with a knife , then finely chop them by crushing them with the blade of the knife until you obtain a sort of cream . Alternatively, you can use a mortar and pestle.
Pour the yogurt into a bowl, adjust with salt and add the oil and the vinegar , alternating between them, then mix well.
Now squeeze the cucumber pressing with the back of a spoon to eliminate all the vegetation water and add it to the yogurt .
Finally, add the garlic cream and stir again . Let your tzatziki sauce rest in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours to allow the flavors to blend together optimally !
To store the tzatziki sauce, you can cover the surface with oil and keep it in the refrigerator for no more than 2-3 days covered with plastic wrap.
Serve the tzatziki in a small bowl garnished with black olives, dill or mint, adding optionally another drizzle of oil on the surface!
Instead of vinegar, lemon juice can be used.
