To prepare the cauliflower cream with torcello, first wash and clean the cauliflower, cut the florets and cook them in salted boiling water for 10 minutes (5 if using a pressure cooker) along with two bay leaves . Once cooked, drain and let them cool. Meanwhile, thinly slice the onion , heat a non-stick pan with butter, and then add the sliced onion .
When the onion starts to sizzle, add the water , let it absorb a bit, and then add the sugar . Let all the water absorb and slightly caramelize the sugar , this will take about ten minutes, then remove from heat and set the onions aside.
Cut each slice of bacon into 3 pieces about half an inch wide and sauté them in a pan for a few seconds over high heat with a drizzle of oil . When the bacon becomes crispy, turn off the heat and set it aside. In a mixer, place the now cold cauliflower, season with salt, add the pepper
and also add the nutmeg . Blend everything for a moment, then add the cream and blend until you get a creamy consistency .
Now assemble the glasses: transfer the cauliflower cream into 12 glasses (you can do this with a pastry bag if you prefer), and garnish each glass with a torcello , a slice of crispy bacon, and the caramelized onion . Now, the cauliflower cream with torcello is ready to be served!
You can store the cauliflower cream with torcello in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for up to 3 days. If you prefer, you can also freeze the cauliflower cream. Before serving, thaw it in the refrigerator and garnish with the caramelized onion and crispy bacon prepared at the moment.
In the cauliflower cream, you can add more or less liquid depending on the consistency you desire. You can replace the cream with the same amount of milk or vegetable broth or even just hot water.
