instructions:
To prepare the pencil-shaped cookies, let's start with the shortcrust pastry. In the blender, add the flour and cold butter in pieces , turn on the blades and get a sandy mixture . Then add the powdered sugar ,
the egg , and grated lemon zest . One last mix with the blades .
Transfer to the work surface and briefly knead with your hands . Shape into a smooth ball, wrap it with plastic wrap , and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least half an hour .
After the time has passed, retrieve the pastry and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface . Achieve a thickness of about 0.2 inches and cut with a pencil-shaped or rectangular cutter measuring 2.75x1.5 inches: in this case, just remove 2 small triangles to get the tip. An alternative to cutters? You can trace the outline yourself with a small knife . As you go, place the cookies to be baked on a baking tray lined with parchment paper .
When they are all ready you can proceed to bake them: in a static oven, pre-heated to 350°F for about 10 minutes . Put them on a tray and let them cool as soon as they are baked .
In the meantime, you can take care of the water icing. In a bowl, pour the powdered sugar and water . Mix with a small whisk to obtain a viscous and not too soft consistency . Divide the icing into as many small bowls as the number of colors you want to obtain and add the coloring .
Now proceed to decoration. Place the icing in small parchment paper cones and decorate the central part and then the tips. Your pencil-shaped cookies are ready, let them dry and they are ready for the snack .
Pencil-shaped cookies can be stored in a cool place, under a glass dome, for 3-4 days. You can prepare the cookies in advance and glaze them later. The icing can be stored in the refrigerator or at room temperature for 4-5 days; keep it covered with a damp cloth or with plastic wrap.
Are you unsure about which type of coloring to use? We suggest gel colors for your pencil-shaped cookies, they have better performance in both color and consistency. Powdered colors might dry out the mixture too much, whereas liquid ones would soften the icing. To flavor the icing, use vanilla sugar or choose lemon or orange juice instead of water!
