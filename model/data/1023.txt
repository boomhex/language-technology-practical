Soft crostata with melon cream is like a tasty twist on the classic Italian fruit tart that lights up summer tables across Italy. This version? It's got an incredibly tender, almost cake-like crust, paired with this creamy, sweet filling that's just bursting with ripe melon flavor. The buttery base holds its shape but, you know, stays moist and light, and that's all thanks to the special pan that forms a perfect hollow for the delicious filling.
And the melon cream—really, it's something else. Blended with pastry cream, it's thicker and richer than whipped cream, but still fresher and more summery than chocolate or heavy custard. So as you slice in, the colorful orange hue and aroma of fresh melon and mint are just, like, perfect on a hot day.

Thing is, this recipe lets even novice bakers create something special without hours of effort. A homemade crostata like this?

To prepare the soft melon tart, start with the base: in a bowl, place the softened butter in pieces and start working it with an electric mixer. Once it has softened, add the sugar and continue to beat the mixture until creamy .
Add the first egg and work with the electric mixer until well absorbed. Then add the second egg and mix until fully combined. Now add the baking powder .
At this point, add a portion of the flour and mix again with the electric mixer . Then, add the remaining flour and mix with a spatula .
Once you have obtained a dense and homogeneous dough , pour it into a 9-inch smart mold, previously buttered, and level it with an offset spatula . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 25 minutes. Once ready, remove the tart from the oven and let it cool at room temperature .
While the tart is baking, you can prepare the cream: pour the milk into a saucepan and bring it to a near boil . Meanwhile, in another saucepan, place the egg yolks and sugar . Mix well with a wooden spoon and add the starch . Stir again until obtaining a homogeneous mixture, without incorporating air.
As soon as the milk starts to boil, pour a small amount into the egg mixture and stir. Then, add the rest of the milk and stir again . Return to the heat and, stirring with a whisk, cook until the cream thickens and almost reaches a boil again .
Transfer the cream into a bowl and cover with cling film directly on the surface . Let it cool first at room temperature and then in the refrigerator. When the cream is cold, take the melon: cut it in half and remove the seeds with a spoon . Using a melon baller of 0.8 inches, make about 30 balls .
Transfer them into a bowl and keep them in the fridge until ready to use. Now, take the remaining melon and scrape 3.5 oz of pulp with a spoon. Transfer it into a bowl and blend it with an immersion blender .
You should obtain a smooth pulp . Take the chilled cream from the fridge and work it with the whisk for a couple of minutes, then add the blended melon pulp and mix well with the whisk to incorporate it .
Now, invert the tart base onto a plate so that the cavity is facing up . Pour the cream inside and level it . Now take the melon balls and place them around the edge on just half of the tart .
Then add the rest to form a half-moon shape and sprinkle powdered sugar on the edge of the soft tart . Decorate with mint leaves and serve .
The soft tart with melon cream keeps well covered in the refrigerator for 2 days.
