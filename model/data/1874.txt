instructions:
To make sweet and sour eggplants, wash and dry the eggplants, then trim them and cut them into fairly thick strips . Peel the garlic and slice it thinly .
In a large pan, heat the 40 g (about 3 tbsp) of oil and fry the sliced garlic . Once the garlic is fried, add the eggplants and cook on medium heat, stirring often until they are soft enough and start to release their water (this will take about 20 minutes).
At this point, increase the heat further and add the aromatic herbs, mint and basil, previously washed and gently dried , the vinegar , sugar ,
salt , and pepper. Mix everything well and let the vinegar evaporate. Lower the heat, cover with a lid , and cook for 10 minutes. Remove the lid, stir well, and finish cooking for the last 5 minutes. Your sweet and sour eggplants are now ready to be served !
Store the sweet and sour eggplants in the refrigerator and consume them within 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can add toasted pine nuts to this recipe, and if you don't like garlic, you can replace it with red onion!
