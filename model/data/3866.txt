instructions:
Cut the stale bread into small cubes and then soak it with milk. Chop half an onion, and let it soften over low heat in a pan containing butter, along with the liver cut into pieces and finely chopped bacon. When the liver is cooked (5-10 minutes), reduce the liver, bacon, and onion mixture into a mush, possibly using a blender. Add the liver mixture and all the other ingredients to the soaked bread: mix everything well to form a compact and uniform dough, which you will place in the refrigerator for a couple of hours, well covered. After the two hours, take the mixture and, with the help of your dampened palms, form balls the size of a mandarin, which you will immerse in the boiling broth and cook for at least 5 minutes over low heat. Place two ladles of broth and two liver dumplings in each deep plate and serve immediately.
To prepare liver dumplings, it would be better to get veal liver, which is more tender, or pork liver, which is very flavorful.
