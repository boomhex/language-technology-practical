To make the chocolate mini panettones, start by preparing the pre-dough: place the warm milk in a large bowl, dissolve the fresh yeast inside (alternatively, you can use 2 g of dry yeast) , add the teaspoon of malt (or sugar) and then incorporate the sifted flour . Mix with a whisk to blend the ingredients, until you obtain a smooth and lump-free mixture.
Cover it with plastic wrap and let it rise in the oven turned off with the light on for 40 minutes until it doubles in volume . Meanwhile, place the chocolate chips in the freezer, so they won't melt when you add them to the dough and won't sink to the bottom of the mini panettones. After the rising time, place the pre-dough in a stand mixer fitted with a K-beater, add the flour , the honey,
then add the sugar , the egg , the orange zest, the salt .
When the ingredients are mixed, replace the beater with the dough hook, and add the softened butter in pieces a little at a time , wait for the previous piece to be absorbed before adding the next. At this point, continue kneading and when the dough is smooth and detaches from the sides of the bowl, remove it, form a ball, and place it in a bowl , cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in the oven turned off with the light on for an hour and a half.
After the resting time, quickly knead the dough and add the chocolate chips (13-14), divide it into 6 equal balls. Grease and line with parchment paper 6 molds with a diameter of 3 inches and 2.75 inches high. Place each ball of dough in a mold, brush the surface with cream and let them rise again until the dough reaches the edge, it will take at least an hour.
At this point, brush the surface again with beaten egg or more cream to make the surface golden. Bake in a static oven at 356°F for 20 minutes until the top is golden . Once cooked, remove the chocolate chip mini panettones from the oven and let them cool. Your mini panettones are ready to be enjoyed as is , or accompanied with a chocolate sauce.
Store the mini panettones in a food bag or wrapped in plastic wrap and consume them within a couple of days. You can freeze the risen dough and then thaw it in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours; it will then need to be briefly kneaded and brought back to room temperature before baking the mini panettones. The baked mini panettones can be frozen once completely cooled and then heated in the oven before consuming.
As an alternative to chocolate chips, you can also use traditional candied fruits or raisins, which you can flavor with a liqueur of your choice such as brandy or Grand Marnier. To accompany the mini panettones, you can make a chocolate ganache: pour the cream into a small saucepan and heat it over low heat, add the dark chocolate and let it melt until you get a smooth sauce, finally flavor it with grated orange zest.
