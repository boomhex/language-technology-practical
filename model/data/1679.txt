instructions:
To prepare pan-fried salmon with dill and sour cream, first take care of cleaning the fish and remove all the bones with kitchen tweezers . Salt the salmon steaks on both sides and massage with your hands , then coat them in flour on both sides .
Wash and chop the dill , then crush the garlic cloves without peeling them, pressing with the flat side of a knife blade . Finally, mix the milk with the sour cream and work the mixture with a fork .
Melt the butter in a large pan and add the garlic cloves in their skins. When the butter starts sizzling , place the salmon steaks and sear them over high heat
on both sides, for about 5 minutes in total . At this point, pour the sour cream into the pan and season with a pinch of salt and pepper .
Add the chopped dill , then lower the heat and cook for another 5 minutes with the lid on so the sauce thickens and the fish absorbs the flavors . After this time, turn off the heat and serve your salmon with dill and sour cream immediately !
Pan-fried salmon with dill and sour cream can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day. When reheating, add a few tablespoons of milk to revive the sauce.
Before the last 5 minutes of cooking, you can add a few drops of lemon juice to the sauce for a touch of freshness! If you don't want to risk burning the butter, you can add a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil to the pan. For a gluten-free version, replace the flour with cornstarch.
