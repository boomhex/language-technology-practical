Ciambella di riso ripiena is a true Italian showstopper, especially beloved in Lombardy where it shines during festive times. This rice ring is crafted with saffron-infused rice that turns a golden yellow, much like the mimosa flowers celebrated on Festa della Donna. Really good stuff. The exterior is lined with thin grilled zucchini strips and slices of pancetta, giving the stuffed rice ring a stunning look once it’s turned out of the mold. Imagine green stripes and salty, crispy pancetta hugging the rice. Inside, you'll find a mix of sweet green peas and melty provola cheese, so every slice offers a burst of tender, cheesy, and slightly moist filling. It’s a baked rice ring that looks fancy but still has those comforting Italian flavors everyone loves. And listen, the way it holds together makes it perfect for sharing at family tables or parties.
Special occasions in Italy often call for something a bit more original, and this Italian rice ring recipe fits the bill with its colorful colors and unique shapes. It's especially popular for Festa della Donna, but you'll also see it at Sunday gatherings or friendly get-togethers. Pretty much feels like a celebration on a plate. Some folks swap in eggplant for the zucchini, particularly in summer, and you can even experiment with different cheeses if you're after a smokier flavor or a little extra gooey bite. There's real pride in how the rice timbale showcases local Lombardy ingredients—between the pancetta, the saffron, and the rich provola, you get an Italian stuffed rice dish that's both fun and seriously tasty. The best part? That first slice, when the layers reveal themselves and the inside is all warm and melty. So so good. Whether you call it a baked risotto ring or a rice mold, it's all about flavor, color, and a bit of that Italian creativity that turns regular rice into something worth celebrating. This dish is proof of the colorful spirit and culinary tradition of Lombardy, making every gathering a bit more special. Really, it’s all you need.
To prepare the filled rice ring, place two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a saucepan and once hot, add the shelled peas , letting them cook for a few minutes. If you prefer, you can flavor the peas with a slice of bacon , or with a bay leaf.
Add a couple of ladles of vegetable broth (alternatively, you can use a light meat broth) and continue cooking the peas, letting all the broth evaporate, for about ten minutes; if necessary, you can add another ladle of broth. The peas should become tender but still slightly crunchy. Salt and pepper to taste and season the peas with a pinch of nutmeg . Cover with a lid and set aside. Meanwhile, wash and trim the zucchinis (take two, each weighing about 7 oz) ,
then use a mandoline to slice them thinly : you should obtain about 20 slices approximately 1/16 inch thick, 1.18-1.57 inches wide, and about 7 inches long. Heat a griddle on the stove, on which you will grill the zucchini slices on both sides (8-9). Once ready, place them on a plate and set them aside.
Move on to preparing the risotto: in a rather large saucepan, put 2 tablespoons of oil and the butter; when the butter has melted, add the chopped onion and let it soften over very low heat for 15 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon . Once golden, add the rice
and stir, toasting it for a couple of minutes . Deglaze with the white wine, which should not be cold but at room temperature . When the wine has evaporated, add a couple of ladles of hot vegetable broth . Continue cooking the rice, adding broth each time the rice has absorbed the previous amount.
Halfway through cooking, dissolve the saffron in a ladle of broth and add it to the rice , continuing to stir . Adjust salt if necessary, and complete the cooking: the rice should be al dente and dry.
Turn off the heat and add the grated Grana Padano PDO , stir well and let rest for a few minutes. Taste the rice and adjust salt and pepper if desired. Cut the provola into cubes about 3/4 inch ; you can also use another cheese of your choice, as long as it is not too watery. In the case of mozzarella, let it drain well in a colander. Now butter a bundt pan with softened butter at room temperature and with the help of a brush, with a top diameter of 9 inches and a capacity of 7 cups .
Line the walls of the mold, alternating and overlapping to half width, a grilled zucchini slice and a bacon slice, making sure to leave the reddest part of the bacon facing outward (22-23), to create a decorative effect when the ring is unmolded. Continue in this way until you have used up the ingredients and completed the entire diameter of the pan .
It's time to assemble our ring: fill the mold with half of the rice , level the surface with the back of a spoon and press in the center of the rice to create a hollow; then raise the rice on the side walls to better accommodate the filling. Place half of the peas in the center of the hollow obtained
until you cover the perimeter of the mold ; add the provola cubes and place the remaining peas on top of them .
Cover everything with the remaining rice, level the surface well with the back of a spoon and sprinkle with a tablespoon of grated Grana Padano PDO . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 40-50 minutes (if using a fan oven, 320°F for 30-40 minutes), then remove the rice ring from the oven. Let it cool slightly, then unmold it onto a serving plate : your stuffed rice ring is ready, isn't it beautiful? Serve by slicing the ring!
The stuffed rice ring can be stored, covered with aluminum foil or plastic wrap, in the refrigerator for a couple of days. If you used fresh and not thawed ingredients, you can freeze the rice ring in slices and then thaw them as needed.
I am very proud of this rice ring! I conceived it for International Women's Day, but of course it can be prepared on any occasion and lends itself to dozens of variations: the risotto can be plain, with sauce, with mushrooms; the peas I used for the filling can be replaced with green beans, fava beans, or asparagus, with or without tomato sauce. The bacon on the outside adds that extra crunchiness, but you can turn it into a vegetarian dish by alternating zucchinis with grilled eggplant slices cut in half, keeping the skin facing outward.
