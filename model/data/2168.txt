Add this to your recipe stash, and you'll get that Southern Italy spirit going for real.
To prepare the beer macaroni timbale with ragù and eggplants, first wash and trim the celery, do the same for the carrot and onion, then cut them into coarse pieces (1-2-3)
and place them in a blender , blend for a few moments to finely chop the ingredients . Grate the salted ricotta and set aside; then wash and trim one of the eggplants: using a mandoline, slice it thinly lengthwise , you will need to obtain 25 slices about 1/8 inch thick, this way you'll be sure to completely line the mold.
Grill the eggplant slices for a few minutes on a hot grill, on both sides . Then take the other eggplant, remove the ends, and cut it into cubes . In a saucepan, heat the olive oil, add the aromatic vegetable mince and let it sauté for 10 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally. If it seems to dry too quickly, add a bit of water.
Add the ground meat and let it absorb the flavors for about ten minutes, stirring often. Then deglaze with the beer and as soon as the alcohol has evaporated, you can add the eggplant cubes . Adjust with salt and pepper and let it cook again on low heat for 15 minutes.
At this point, add the tomato puree and continue cooking for another 30-40 minutes : let the sauce dry completely otherwise it may make the mixture too soft during cooking. At the end of cooking, perfume with basil .
Cook the rigatoni al dente in plenty of salted water for 7-8 minutes. In a bowl, pour the ragù, the drained al dente rigatoni , the grated salted ricotta and mix.
Take a 1.5-liter pudding mold and butter it ; start lining it with the grilled eggplant slices, following the mold's grooves; place them slightly overlapping lengthwise, making sure one end of each slice slightly exceeds the mold's edge . Stuff with the rigatoni
up to the edge ; you will need to distribute the mixture well around, especially in the mold's hollows, and once you reach the top, press well to then fold the ends of the eggplant slices inward and cover with the remaining grilled eggplant slices : lay these last slightly overlapping like forming a spiral and brush them with olive oil .
Bake in a preheated oven at 356°F for 40-45 minutes (or 30-35 minutes at 320°F if you bake in a fan oven). Then take the macaroni timbale out of the oven, let it cool for about ten minutes ; then place a serving plate on the mold and flip everything over to unmold gently . If you notice that liquid is coming out from the bottom, it means it might need a few more minutes of cooking; in this case, if you prefer, you can put it back in the mold, cover with aluminum foil and return to the oven at the same temperature for about 10 minutes. Your beer macaroni timbale with ragù and eggplants is ready, enjoy your meal !
You can store the beer macaroni timbale with ragù and eggplants in the refrigerator well wrapped in plastic wrap for up to 3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Don't like dark beer? You can use a light beer for a more delicate flavor and a double malt for a sweeter taste. You can add grated parmesan instead of salted ricotta or mozzarella cubes left to dry on a clean cloth for an hour so as not to lose the whey during cooking.
