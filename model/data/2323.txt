To prepare the tuna and salmon skewers with Thai salad, start with the salad: peel the carrot, then, using the vegetable peeler, cut very thin strips lengthwise . Then, without removing the peel, also make thin slices of cucumber . Finally, peel the mango
and cut it into rather thick slices ; then move on to the fresh chili: remove the stem and the inner seeds, then cut it into thin slices
Finally, chop the cashews . Now that you have all the ingredients, assemble the salad: in a serving plate, place the washed and dried lamb's lettuce , the thin carrot slices
and add the cucumber and the mango . When it's time to serve the salad, you can dress it with sesame oil and the chopped cashews .
Proceed to the preparation of the skewers: remove any bones from the tuna steak, then cut it into strips and then into cubes about 1 cm thick . Pour the tuna into a large bowl and drizzle it with sesame oil
and soy sauce and season with a grating of fresh ginger and lemongrass .
Mix all the ingredients and make sure that all the cubes of tuna are immersed in the marinade, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it marinate in the fridge for about 2 hours. Meanwhile, focus on the salmon: use kitchen tweezers to remove any bones from the steak, then cut the salmon into strips and then into cubes about 1 cm thick . Place the cubes in a bowl and pour the soy sauce over them .
Then squeeze the juice of half a lime and add it to the rest of the ingredients , along with the honey .
Finally, flavor the marinade with the Tabasco . Mix all the ingredients and make sure that the salmon cubes are all immersed in the marinade; then cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the fridge for about 2 hours. After the necessary time, pour the white and black sesame seeds together in a small bowl and prepare the poppy seeds separately.
Take the tuna cubes and start making skewers, putting 4 cubes on each skewer . Roll it in the mix of white and black sesame seeds and proceed this way until you run out of tuna cubes. Then move on to the salmon: skewer 4 salmon cubes on each skewer and
and cover the salmon skewers with poppy seeds . Then turn on the heat under the grill and wait until it becomes red-hot, then cook your tuna and salmon skewers for just a few seconds on each side . Serve your tuna and salmon skewers hot or warm along with the Thai salad !
It is recommended to consume the tuna and salmon skewers as soon as they are ready, along with the salad.
