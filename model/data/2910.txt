Looking to jazz up Italian cuisine? Well, this polenta sandwich with salmon and crescenza is for you. For real. In places like Lombardy and Veneto, they’re a party hit when you want something, you know, different. So, start with grilled polenta triangles—crispy outside and soft inside. Seriously good. The crescenza cheese sandwich part comes from layering this creamy Italian cheese between the polenta slices. Crescenza is famous in Northern Italy for being mild and fresh, and it just melts in your mouth. Add fresh salmon slices, and you've got this awesome mix of tender fish, rich cheese, and that crunch from the polenta. Super tasty. It's simple yet feels fancy, and looks great on a platter. And the best part? You can say it’s a classic from Lombardy and Veneto, but with a twist—thanks to the salmon.
These salmon sandwiches are perfect as finger food at buffets or appetizers for a relaxed dinner. What makes this dish stand out is how easy it is to put together. Pretty much. Everyone will think you’ve whipped up some gourmet snack. In Northern Italy, polenta is, well, a big deal. Making it golden and crispy on the grill gives a perfect base for toppings. Pairing it with crescenza and salmon is a newer idea, but if you like mixing traditional with fresh, it’s way way better. Honestly, the whole thing screams easy, modern Italian food—no fuss, just layer, grill, and eat. If you’re hunting for more polenta and salmon recipe ideas, this one’s a must-try. People really love the combo of moist cheese and tangy salmon, and you end up with a polenta and cheese sandwich that’s really really different from anything you’d find in a regular deli. It’s the perfect snack for both fancy parties and casual hangouts with friends. Which is great, right?
To make the polenta sandwiches with salmon and crescenza, start with the polenta: follow our Polenta recipe to prepare the polenta. Put a pot with water on high heat and bring it to a boil. Then add a level tablespoon of coarse salt , and olive oil
and sprinkle in the cornmeal while stirring continuously with a wooden spoon or whisk . Continue stirring in the same direction, mixing the deeper layer with the surface until the mixture is well combined. After about 40 minutes, it will start to detach from the sides of the pot: continue cooking for another 20 minutes. Meanwhile, brush a loaf pan that measures about 10x4 inches with oil,
transfer the polenta into the mold , distribute the mixture evenly, and level the surface with a spatula or the back of a spoon. Allow the polenta to set for about 2 hours at room temperature .
After this time, turn the polenta out onto a cutting board , cut it into slices about 0.2 inches thick , and then cut each slice diagonally to make triangles: this way, you'll get sandwiches .
Put a grill pan on the heat and grill the polenta sandwiches for a few minutes until the surface is golden . Now, take care of the salmon: it is crucial that the salmon is fresh, and ensure with your supplier that it has been "flash-frozen," i.e., frozen at the correct temperature (kept between -4 and -22 degrees Fahrenheit for 24-48 hours). Clean the fillet by removing the bones with kitchen tweezers , then cut the salmon into thin strips and set them aside.
At this point, you can fill the sandwiches: take a slice of sandwich and spread fresh crescenza cheese on top , place a strip of salmon on it, and close with another slice of sandwich . Your polenta sandwiches with salmon and crescenza are ready to be enjoyed!
It is recommended to consume the polenta sandwiches with salmon and crescenza immediately; if any are leftover, store them in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to one day.
However, freezing is not recommended.
For a richer taste, you can flavor the crescenza with chives or fennel.
