instructions:
To prepare the tagliolini with baby octopus, start by cleaning the mollusks: wash them under running water , then peel the skin , remove the insides , the beak (which is found in the center of the tentacles)
and the eyes, . Once cleaned, cut the baby octopus into small pieces, separating the tentacles . In a large pan, heat the oil and add the minced garlic , being careful not to let it turn golden,
add a pinch of red pepper flakes , then as soon as it starts to sizzle, add the baby octopus , and stir the seafood
and deglaze with the white wine . Let them cook for about ten minutes over low heat and covered , at the end season with salt if necessary .
Finally, add the chopped parsley to flavor . Meanwhile, prepare the portion of pasta you need and cook the pasta , when al dente, drain it
and pour it directly into the pan with the baby octopus . Mix and cook the tagliolini with baby octopus for another 5 minutes . In the last minute, stir often, so it blends well with the seafood sauce, and finally season with black pepper. Let rest for 1-2 minutes and serve immediately at the table.
Consume the tagliolini immediately after preparation; if any baby octopus sauce remains, store it in the refrigerator for no more than one day.

I go crazy for this dish and love it, especially in the version I propose to you. However, my girls sometimes ask me to add a bit of color, in which case I add cherry tomatoes to the sauce: exquisite!
