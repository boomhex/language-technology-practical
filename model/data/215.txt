instructions:
To prepare the vareniki with cherries, start with the dough: in a bowl, place the sifted flour, then add the warm water , sunflower oil , and a pinch of salt .
First, work with a fork , then move to the workbench and knead with your hands until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough . If the dough is too sticky, you can add a bit more flour. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Meanwhile, prepare the filling: in a bowl, place the tvorog and mash it with a spoon or fork , then add the sugar and mix . Taste to adjust the sweetness to your liking.
Now take the dough and divide it in half . Roll out both parts with a rolling pin to get two sheets about 1/16 inch thick . Use a glass or cookie cutter to cut out discs about 3 inches in diameter .
Remove the excess dough , which can be re-kneaded to make more discs. Fill the discs with a spoonful of filling and a canned cherry .
Fold the discs in half and seal them into half-moons by pinching the edges . Cook the dumplings in boiling water with a pinch of salt added . Meanwhile, melt the butter and pour it into a bowl.
Drain the vareniki when they float to the top, it will take about 3-4 minutes, then transfer them directly into the bowl with the melted butter . Toss to coat them well with the dressing . Pour a tablespoon of sour cream on the serving plates and place the vareniki on top .
Drizzle them with the liquid from the canned cherries and honey . Finally, garnish with almond flakes . Your vareniki with cherries are ready to be served !
Vareniki with cherries can be stored in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for 1-2 days at most.
If you can't find tvorog, you can substitute it with well-drained ricotta.
The version with canned cherries is a much-loved classic, but you can vary the filling according to the season or your tastes: one of the most popular alternatives is with fresh pitted cherries, perfect in summer!
If desired, you can flavor the filling with a pinch of cinnamon or grated lemon zest.
