Lasagne colorate really stands out, especially during festive gatherings like a Sunday lunch or a big Carnival celebration in Emilia-Romagna . And here’s the thing: this colorful lasagna isn't just about taste—it's a total feast for the eyes! By mixing beetroot, spinach, and saffron into the pasta dough and the béchamel sauce, you get layers that are bright pink, deep green, and cheerful yellow. Super festive.
It's almost like the Arlecchino costume from old Italian stories. Each bite is both moist and tender, with a creamy feel from the béchamel that ties all those veggies together perfectly. Even though it looks fancy, this is real comfort food, sticking to the traditional flavors loved in Emilia-Romagna for years.
What makes this vegetable lasagna extra special is how it turns a classic, golden-baked layered pasta dish into something really festive—perfect for those who want their Carnival meal to pop with color. The crispy edges from baking add a nice texture, while the sweet notes from the beetroot and the tangy hit from the spinach make every layer taste unique. Families love that this rainbow lasagna fits right in with Carnival’s playful vibes. Which is great.
It's also a smart pick if you’re searching for a healthy lasagna recipe that’s meat-free and packed with veggies. Some towns in Emilia-Romagna even add their own twists, maybe swapping in pumpkin or using wild herbs—depending on the season—so each version has its own surprise.
Whether you’re making it for a holiday or just want a dish that feels really special, a slice of this multicolored lasagna makes the meal feel like a party. So, look, it keeps everyone coming back for seconds. It's a bright way to enjoy flavors with a modern twist, bringing joy and color to any table. For real.
To prepare the colorful lasagna, start with the ragù: prepare a mince of onion, celery, carrot and sauté it over low heat for a few minutes, adding Vegetable broth . When the vegetables have softened, add the ground meat , stir, and season with salt and pepper to taste; cook the white ragù for at least 30 minutes.
Halfway through cooking, you can deglaze the meat with white wine ; when the ragù is ready, turn off the heat and set it aside. Meanwhile, prepare the Béchamel sauce : in a saucepan, melt the butter, then add the sifted flour slowly , stirring with a whisk to avoid lumps .
Gradually add the previously warmed milk , and continue stirring to thicken the mixture over low heat; you can flavor with grated nutmeg and add a pinch of salt. When the béchamel has reached a creamy consistency, turn off the heat and divide it into three small bowls (cover them with plastic wrap in contact with the surface to prevent a skin from forming). In a separate pan, pour a little oil and the crushed garlic, then cook the previously washed spinach .
It will take just a few minutes to wilt them, then season with salt and pepper to taste before turning off the heat. Blend the cooked spinach and set them aside. Proceed with cleaning the beets: cut them into cubes
and blend them (13-14), then season with a teaspoon of oil and salt to taste.
Lastly, in a small bowl, dissolve the saffron powder with a little vegetable broth (16-17). Now you have all the preparations ready .
Season the bowls of béchamel with the different creams, spinach , beetroot , and saffron, so as to have three béchamels of different colors and flavors .
At this point, take a 8x12 inch rectangular baking dish, pour a little oil and some saffron cream on the bottom. Lay the egg pasta sheets , a layer of ragù , and a layer of beetroot cream; sprinkle with grated Parmesan and chopped thyme .
Continue with another layer of pasta , then alternate the layers with ragù, Parmesan, the other two colorful creams, and thyme until you run out of ingredients (you can finish with the spinach béchamel). Then spread the remaining ragù and sprinkle with Parmesan .
Pour the leftover colorful béchamel into piping bags and create colorful decorative patterns . You can bake the colorful lasagna in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 40 minutes (or in a fan oven at 320°F for 30 minutes). Take the colorful lasagna out of the oven and serve hot!
You can store the colorful lasagna in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container for 1-2 days. They can be prepared the day before, kept in the fridge covered with plastic wrap, and baked the next day. They can be frozen, only if all fresh ingredients were used, preferably uncooked: to cook them, just thaw them in the fridge about 24 hours before and then bake.
Variations to make the colors? Try using greens for green, purple carrots or potatoes, pumpkin for yellow-orange, or tomato for red! If you prefer a stronger flavor, you can always replace Parmesan with Pecorino!
