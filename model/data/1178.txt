instructions:
To prepare the vegetable and bulgur soup, start by cleaning all the vegetables. Begin with the cauliflowers. The first thing to do is remove the base , then cut into pieces to reduce the size of the largest florets .
Once the florets are prepared, wash and dry them . Peel the potatoes and cut into chunks about 3/4 inch (2 cm) .
Then prepare the chopped celery for the soffritto , clean and slice the carrots , and the cherry tomatoes ,
and finally the onion . Now that everything is ready, move to the stove. Heat a large pan, add a dash of oil, and sauté the soffritto for a few minutes . Then add the potatoes ,
and the cauliflower . Then pour in water to cover the vegetables , cover with a lid, and let cook for about half an hour, or until the vegetables are cooked .
After the time has elapsed, season with salt and blend everything until you have a cream . Pour in the bulgur ,
also pour in the water needed to cook the bulgur as per the package directions , initially making the mixture liquid. Stir occasionally and at the end of cooking, drizzle some oil . Your vegetable and bulgur soup is ready .
The vegetable and bulgur soup can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days in an airtight container.
Freezing the ready-made dish is not recommended, but the cooked and blended vegetables can be frozen if fresh ones were used initially.
Enhance your vegetable and bulgur soup by using other types of vegetables to your liking, and you can also add creamy cheeses to make it even more delicious!
