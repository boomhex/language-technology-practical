To prepare the Molise colac, start with the dough: break the eggs into a small bowl and add the sugar, mixing with a fork or a whisk until you have a homogeneous mixture . In another large bowl, pour the flour, add the beaten yolks with sugar in the center , and then also pour in the lard .
Also pour in the dry white wine and start mixing the ingredients with your hands . Once you have a sufficiently homogeneous dough, transfer it to a lightly floured work surface . Continue kneading for a few minutes to obtain a dough ball.
Wrap it in plastic wrap . Refrigerate for at least one hour while you work on the filling: in a mixer, add the stale bread crumbs, peeled walnuts and almonds , figs
and the apple . Blend until you get a uniform mixture. Then flavor with cinnamon and ground cloves .
Blend again for a few moments , then pour the obtained mixture into a saucepan. Add the honey and mix everything, cooking over low heat for just a few minutes .
Then transfer the filling to a bowl, stir to cool slightly, then add grated orange zest for fragrance and stir again. Take the rested dough, roll it out to about a millimeter thick .
Cut with a pastry cutter about 2.75 inches in diameter . Place a teaspoon of filling at the center of each circle , close the ravioli and seal the edges by pressing with the tines of a fork . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 10 minutes. Continue kneading the leftover dough to create more cookies to bake as soon as the others are ready: you will get about 25 cookies with these amounts. Your Molise colac are ready: just let them cool completely and then sprinkle them with powdered sugar.
