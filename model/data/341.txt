instructions:
To prepare baked peppers, first place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, then salt . Bake in a preheated oven, static function, at 428° F for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer the peppers to a bowl , then cover with plastic wrap and let them cool slightly. The steam will soften the flesh and make peeling easier.
At this point, remove the seeds and peel the peppers . Cut the flesh into strips about 0.4 inches thick and gather them in a bowl.
Finely chop the garlic and parsley with a knife, then add them to the peppers .
Also add the Taggiasca olives , then season with oil, salt , and pepper. Mix and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld well. Your baked peppers are ready to be served !
Baked peppers can be stored in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for 3-4 days.
A drizzle of balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar added at the end, before serving, will provide a touch of acidity that pairs wonderfully with the sweetness of the peppers.
For a heartier version, serve the peppers with anchovies and capers, or with shavings of pecorino cheese or lard!
