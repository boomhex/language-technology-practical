To prepare the baked tagliatelle casserole, start with the fresh egg pasta: in the bowl of a stand mixer equipped with a dough hook, add the sifted flour , eggs, and a pinch of paprika . Turn on the mixer to work the ingredients .
Continue kneading until the dough becomes smooth and homogeneous and detaches from the sides . Form a dough ball and wrap it with plastic wrap to place it in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Meanwhile, focus on the filling: shell the peas
then finely chop the carrots , onion, celery, thyme and sausage removed from its casing .
In a large pan, sauté the carrots, onions, celery, and a peeled garlic clove in a drizzle of oil. When the soffritto has softened, add the chopped sausage , mix, and brown well, then add the thyme and deglaze with white wine .
When the wine has evaporated and the sausage is well browned, add the peas and let cook for about ten more minutes, then season with salt and pepper and turn off the heat . In a small bowl, sieve the ricotta
flavor it with nutmeg , season with salt and pepper to taste, then add the milk and mix the ingredients before adding the white ragù .
Mix the ingredients and set the filling aside. Retrieve the fresh pasta and divide it into two pieces to roll it out more easily. Attach the pasta roller to the stand mixer, which with its planetary motion will allow you to roll out the dough .
Repeat the operation several times until it becomes a few millimeters thin, then set it to obtain the tagliatelle which you can spread on a sieve or a lightly floured tray, and dust with a little flour to let them dry . After letting them rest for 15-20 minutes, you can cook them in boiling water in which you have poured a little oil (this will prevent the tagliatelle from sticking together during cooking) .
Cook the tagliatelle for 1-2 minutes and drain them al dente; place them in a bowl and pour over the ragù sauce and ricotta cream , then mix thoroughly .
Take a 12x8-inch baking dish and brush it with butter , then sprinkle with breadcrumbs on both the bottom and the sides (29-30).
Pour the dressed tagliatelle inside and distribute them evenly ; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and gratinate in the oven under the grill at 392°F for 5-10 minutes. Then remove the baked tagliatelle casserole from the oven and serve it hot!
Store the baked tagliatelle casserole in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 1-2 days. They can be frozen only if fresh, not thawed, ingredients have been used. The egg pasta can be frozen, preferably stretched out in rectangles separated by plastic wrap so that you can thaw only the necessary portion at a time.
The recipe title invites you to invent new ways to dress the tagliatelle: instead of peas, artichokes for example, while instead of sausage, ground meat!
