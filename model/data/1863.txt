instructions:
To make the sweet potato pancakes, first, boil the sweet potato for about 20 minutes , or until it is soft. Then drain it and peel it .
In a bowl, add the eggs along with the milk , add the cooked sweet potato , and blend everything with an immersion blender .
until you get a smooth, lump-free mixture . Then add the sugar and the baking powder .
and the flour . Blend again with the mixer until you get a thick and smooth batter .
Grease a non-stick pan with a little butter and heat it on the stove. Once it's hot, pour a ladle of batter ; it will spread on its own, creating the classic pancake shape .
As soon as small bubbles appear on the surface , it's time to flip the pancakes . Cook them on the other side until they are golden underneath. Then, as you cook them, transfer the pancakes to a serving plate .
Once you have cooked your pancakes, lightly clean the pan and put it back on the stove. Place the bacon slices and cook them until they are crispy , turning them occasionally. Once the bacon is crispy, chop it with a knife and serve the sweet potato pancakes with maple syrup and crispy bacon , or with your preferred toppings!
The batter can be stored in an airtight container for up to 12 hours due to the presence of raw eggs. Once cooked, the pancakes can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. Covered with plastic wrap.
If the butter colors too much, just clean the pan with some kitchen paper and grease it again. Cook your pancakes on low flame so that they color evenly on both sides. Instead of bacon, serve the pancakes with fruit, Greek yogurt, or jams.
