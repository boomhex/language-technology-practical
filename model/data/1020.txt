instructions:
To make the cream and plum tart, start with the shortcrust: in a bowl, add the brown sugar, medium egg , butter, salt , and lemon zest .
Quickly work the ingredients with your hands . You'll get a not entirely homogeneous mixture . Add the flour and finish kneading with your hands.
When the egg and butter are completely absorbed by the flour, the dough will be smooth and homogeneous . Form a dough ball, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the cream: in a bowl, combine the almond flour, all-purpose flour ,
the brown sugar , the egg , and the almond milk .
Mix for a few seconds with a whisk and add the oil . Continue for a few more seconds and add a pinch of salt . You should get a smooth cream . Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator.
Roll out the shortcrust dough on a floured work surface , aiming for a thickness of about 1/5 inch . Carefully lay the rolled-out dough in a 9-inch springform pan, pressing it gently against the base and sides with your fingers (it doesn't matter if it's not perfect or symmetrical at this stage). Trim the excess to create an edge about 1 1/5 inches high .
Cut the plums in half and remove the pits . Slice them thinly, about 1/6 inch thick , then set aside 5.3 oz of slices for decoration and cut the remaining 5.3 oz of slices in half for the filling.
Take the frangipane cream out of the refrigerator , incorporate the plums for the filling, and mix . Pour the mixture into the shortcrust shell .
Using a teaspoon, add the plum jam . Arrange the reserved plum slices on the surface , creating a radial pattern .
Garnish with sliced almonds . Bake in a static oven at 356°F, on the middle shelf, for 40 minutes. Then lower the oven temperature to 302°F and bake for another 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool thoroughly before removing from the pan. Decorate the edge with a little brown powdered sugar .
The cream and plum tart can be stored in the fridge for 3 days. You can freeze it after baking. The raw shortcrust dough ball can be frozen.
We recommend slicing the fruits just before serving to prevent them from browning due to oxidation.
