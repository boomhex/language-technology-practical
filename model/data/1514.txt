instructions:
To make the crab meat tartlets, first wash, dry, and chop the parsley and set it aside. Roll out the puff pastry on the work surface, place round molds with a diameter of 4 inches on top, and cut out the shape around the edge with a small knife . You will get 5 pastry discs .
Remove the excess pastry and set them aside. Now butter the bottom and edges of the same molds and place a puff pastry disc inside, making sure the pastry adheres well to the mold .
In a bowl, pour the whole eggs, add salt , pepper, and season with the chopped parsley . Mix with a fork ,
add the cream and stir to obtain a light and homogeneous mixture. At this point, incorporate the drained crab meat . Fill each mold with two tablespoons of the mixture .
Place the filled molds on a baking sheet and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 25 minutes, on the middle rack of the oven. If necessary, continue baking with the grill to brown the tartlets well on the surface. Once baking is complete, remove the crab meat tartlets from the molds and let them cool slightly before serving .
The crab meat tartlets can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days. We do not recommend freezing them.
To vary the flavor of the filling, you can use chives or thyme as an alternative to parsley.
