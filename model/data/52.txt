instructions:
To prepare the veal scallopine with vin santo, pumpkin, and mixed mushrooms, start with the vegetables: cut the pumpkin into slices and remove the seeds and the outer part, then cut the flesh into smaller slices and then into cubes .
Then clean the mushrooms: clean all species by removing the part of the stem most dirty with soil, then clean them with a damp cloth and if necessary, quickly rinse them under running water to remove any impurities on the stem or under the cap. Then cut them into slices (4-5). Next, in a pot, heat the oil and sauté the whole peeled garlic: you can remove it immediately afterwards and add the pumpkin cubes ; sauté over high heat for about 8 minutes, stirring and seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.
When the pumpkin is flavored, add the mushrooms and cook over high heat for 12-13 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Towards the end of cooking, deglaze with vin santo , then turn off the heat and keep warm.
At this point, take the meat and coat it on both sides with cornstarch ; in a pan, sauté a whole clove of garlic, then remove it and place the meat slices to sear them for 1 minute on each side. Then deglaze with vin santo and turn off the heat.
Place the scallopine in the pot with the mushrooms and pumpkin , season with rosemary and serve the veal scallopine with vin santo, pumpkin, and mixed mushrooms hot !
Store the veal scallopine with vin santo, pumpkin, and mixed mushrooms in the refrigerator for 1-2 days in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
Choose porcini mushrooms if you wish to give a stronger flavor to the scallopine, while for a creamier effect you could blend half of the mushrooms and mix them with the others.
For a correct choice, treatment, and storage of mushrooms, refer to the Ministry of Health guidelines .
