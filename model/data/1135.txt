instructions:
To prepare the pumpkin puree, start by cleaning it to get 700 g (1.54 lbs) of flesh. Cut it into slices and remove the skin , then cut it into cubes . Do the same with the potatoes by peeling them first .
Then cut them into cubes . Place the pumpkin and potatoes in a steamer , set over a pot with boiling water, and cover with the lid .
The cubes will cook in about 40 minutes , but check with a fork to ensure they are tender . Transfer everything to a potato masher .
and make a puree . Transfer it to a pot and add the oil , the milk .
and then season with cinnamon, salt, and pepper . At this point, place on the stove over low heat and stir with a whisk for a few minutes, so the mixture is smooth and creamy . Turn off the heat and enjoy the pumpkin puree while it's hot .
Pumpkin puree can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days, or you can choose to freeze it if needed.
Do you want to make the pumpkin puree an even tastier side dish, maybe a main course? Add cubes of cured meats, like ham or salami, and then some cheese. Additionally, a nice gratin in the oven could make it a truly exquisite dish! Finally, if you don't like cinnamon or want to add a spicy note, then grate some fresh ginger.
