And look, this classic Italian pasta recipe is about letting a few local ingredients shine. In Sicily, they cook fresh fava beans slowly with peeled tomatoes and wild fennel, letting everything meld on low heat until you get a creamy purée packed with flavor. The wild fennel is key here—it’s got this tangy kick and earthiness that makes the dish stand out from other traditional Italian pasta dishes . The casarecce pasta, with its twisty shape, picks up every bit of that smooth, moist bean sauce, making each bite feel extra comforting and rustic.
Throughout southern Italy, you’ll find all sorts of spins on this pasta with fava bean sauce —sometimes folks add stale bread for homemade croutons or drizzle on a generous amount of good extra virgin olive oil right before serving. And that bit of toasted bread on top? Really really good. It gives you a crispy bite that pairs beautifully with the soft, tender texture of the beans. This dish is pretty simple to make but tastes like it took all afternoon. Not fancy food—just something hearty and homey that’s perfect for a family dinner or any night you crave a taste of Sicily.
The flavors here really celebrate those southern Italian ingredients, and the slow cooking brings out a sweet richness you just can’t fake.

To prepare the casarecce with fava bean puree, sauté a finely chopped onion in a non-stick pot with a little oil for a couple of minutes over low heat. When the onion turns golden, add the frozen fava beans, the tomato pulp , the chopped fennel , and the cold water , which you have previously salted.
Cook everything slowly for about 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until you get a rather thick mixture . Using an immersion blender, turn it all into a cream , leaving some vegetable pieces visible, then adjust the salt and add chili pepper if desired. Take the pasta
and pour it into the fava bean puree ; continue to cook over low heat, stirring occasionally . Once cooked, season with a drizzle of raw extra virgin olive oil; serve the casarecce with fava bean puree accompanied by warm bread croutons .
Casarecce with fava bean puree can be stored in the refrigerator, closed in an airtight container, for up to one day. We do not recommend freezing this dish.
If you wish, you can replace the casarecce with broken spaghetti. If you prefer, you can also use fresh or dried fava beans, but remember to soak the latter for at least 12 hours before cooking them. You can use fresh diced tomatoes instead of the chopped tomato pulp.
