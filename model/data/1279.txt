instructions:
To prepare the chili pepper and Grana Padano lollipops, first cut the chili peppers into slices about 1/8 inch thick , then grate the Grana Padano PDO and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour a teaspoon of grated Grana on the tray using a 1.5-inch diameter round cutter to form 6 slightly spaced discs , then place a popsicle stick at the base of each disc .
Now place a slice of chili pepper in the center of each disc and cover with another teaspoon of Grana Padano PDO, again using the round cutter . Once ready , bake the lollipops in a preheated static oven at 375°F for about 10 minutes.
After this time, sprinkle a bit more Grana Padano on top of the chili pepper slices to cover them further and bake for another 2 minutes, until the cheese is melted and golden . Remove from the oven and let the chili pepper and Grana Padano lollipops cool before serving and enjoying them !
It is recommended to consume the chili pepper and Grana Padano lollipops on the same day. They cannot be frozen.
Choose sweet chili peppers for a non-spicy version.
For the little ones, instead of chili peppers, you can opt for Grana Padano and seeds like sesame or sunflower, or other vegetables like carrots or tomatoes... of course, paying close attention to the cooking times!
