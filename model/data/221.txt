The gluten-free Christmas roll has really become a favorite among Italian families, especially during the holidays when everyone wants something festive yet lighter. I mean, instead of the usual heavy desserts, this roll uses a soft gluten-free sponge—called ‘pasta biscotto’—that gives the whole thing a tender bite. And listen, the filling? It’s a creamy mix that’s completely lactose-free , making it perfect for anyone with food intolerances.
In Italy, people love adding chocolate chips and fresh raspberries, which bring a tangy kick and a splash of holiday color. Compared to a traditional yule log, this gluten-free Christmas roll feels more airy and less intense. Really, it’s a great choice for those who want to keep things light but special. And since it’s both gluten-free and lactose-free , it really really opens up the dessert table for everyone, which is what the holidays are all about.
Plus, Italian bakers are known for riffing on classics—like using gluten-free flour in savoiardi or updating plumcake for modern diets—and this roll fits right in with that vibe. For those who grew up with buttery panettone or rich Christmas cakes, this dessert offers a fun switch-up. So here's the thing, the moist cake holds together well, giving you a nice swirl when sliced, and the sweet raspberries against the chocolate chips? Pretty much a solid combo.
People appreciate that it doesn’t feel like you’re missing out on anything. Really, this lactose-free Christmas roll still looks fancy—especially when dusted with a little powdered sugar or dressed up with berries. Plus, since it’s part of the gluten-free holiday baking trend going strong in Italy, there’s pride in making something that tastes just as good as the classics. No one at the table has to feel left out—because the point of a good gluten-free festive roll is celebrating together, without worries about ingredients. And you know what? That's what makes it special.

Level it evenly . Bake in a static oven at 375°F for about 17 minutes, until the surface turns a light golden brown . Once ready, immediately flip it onto a sheet of parchment paper and remove the baking paper.
