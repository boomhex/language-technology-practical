Spaghetti al Chianti really brings a taste of Tuscany to your table. It’s not just your usual pasta night—it’s way more interesting. Instead of just tossing noodles in tomato sauce, this Spaghetti al Chianti gets its bold color and flavor from Chianti wine. For real, it's a famous red from the Tuscan hills. The sauce kicks off with leeks stewed in Chianti, turning into a thick, almost velvety blend. It clings to every bite of pasta. People in Tuscany? They know how to make the most of local stuff. And listen, the Chianti isn’t just for drinking; it goes straight into the food. Gives you a rich, kind of earthy taste that's hard to beat.
Plus, the addition of speck—an Italian cured meat—brings a savory and just slightly smoky edge. It works perfectly with the wine sauce. The whole thing looks different from your usual pasta. Noodles take on a reddish, almost golden glow, and a flavor that really stands out.
You don’t need any fancy tricks to pull this Chianti spaghetti recipe together. That's part of what makes it so appealing for anyone who likes to try something new but wants to keep things simple. Really simple. The use of Chianti makes this a true red wine pasta —you get that tender, saucy texture and a taste that’s just a little tangy from the wine but balanced out by the smooth leeks and speck. Folks around Tuscany, they have a reputation for turning a few quality ingredients into something special. That’s what you get here: an easy Chianti wine pasta with a real kick of flavor. It’s definitely going to get some attention at the dinner table.
Whether you call it Italian drunken spaghetti or just a fun twist on a classic, this dish is all about making pasta with a sense of fun. Seriously fun. And some moist, delicious results. Enjoy this Tuscan delight with friends and family—it's a vibe—and let the flavors transport you to the beautiful vineyards of Italy.
To prepare the spaghetti with Chianti, clean, wash, and finely slice the leek , removing the tougher outer leaves. Set aside some leek rings for the final garnish and let the rest wilt over low heat in a non-stick pan with 2 tablespoons of butter (2-3).
When the leek is well wilted, add the Chianti wine , a grating of nutmeg , and a pinch of salt. Let everything reduce for a few minutes over moderate heat until the alcohol in the wine has completely evaporated. At this point, transfer the mixture to a mixer and blend everything until you obtain a creamy consistency; salt and pepper to taste.
Cut the speck into strips and sauté it in the pan with the remaining butter for a couple of minutes , until it becomes crispy. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, then blanch the leek you had set aside for garnish for a few seconds , remove it, and set it aside.
In the same water, cook the spaghetti and drain them al dente, reserving a ladle of cooking water, then add them to the speck and sauté together for a couple of minutes. In the wine cream, add the ladle of cooking water ,
mix and add the sauce thus obtained to the pasta . Mix all the ingredients very well, sprinkle with grated cheese , and decorate with leek rings . The spaghetti with Chianti is ready, serve and enjoy it immediately!
We recommend consuming the spaghetti with Chianti immediately, but if you wish, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one day.
If you prefer, you can replace the speck with bacon. If the wine and leek cream turns out too dense, you can add enough cooking water to reach the desired consistency.
