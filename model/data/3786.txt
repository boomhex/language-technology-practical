instructions:
To prepare the almond granita, start by cutting the almond paste into small cubes of equal size . Pour them into a tall-sided container and add the water .
Blend the ingredients using an immersion blender until you get a cream . Pour the mixture into the ice cream maker (follow your ice cream maker's instructions: for the one we used, it's not necessary to cool the bowl in the refrigerator) .
Let the ice cream maker run for at least 30 minutes . After this time, you will obtain a creamy and compact mixture. Then transfer the granita to glasses, preferably chilled so it doesn't melt quickly , and serve the almond granita for a refreshing snack !
You can store the almond granita in the freezer in an airtight container for up to 1 month.
Can't find sweetened almond paste? No problem: add 2/3 cup of sugar!
Almond paste is made from uncooked marzipan, sometimes identified with marzipan itself. Some also call it "royal paste."
You can find almond paste in stores specializing in the sale of regional food products or in pastry shops.
