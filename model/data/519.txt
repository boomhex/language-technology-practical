instructions:
To prepare Swiss meringue, first place a mixing bowl over a pot of water. Pour the egg whites and sugar inside and turn the heat to medium. Cook over a double boiler, ensuring the water does not touch the mixing bowl, stirring continuously with a spatula and keeping the temperature under control with a kitchen thermometer. You should reach a temperature of 140-149°F.
At this point, remove the bowl from the heat and the pot of water and beat with an electric mixer until the meringue is completely cool. The mixture should be glossy and have the consistency of shaving foam and will be ready if you see peaks form when you lift the beaters. You can use the meringue in two ways. Transfer it to a piping bag fitted with a star tip and pipe 30 dollops onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper . Bake in a static oven at 194°F for about 2 hours. They will be ready when they are dry, very light, and hollow inside. Or you can use the Swiss meringue to decorate your desserts and flambé it with a blowtorch .
Baked Swiss meringue can be stored in a sealed container in a cool, dry place for about 1 month. If you use Swiss meringue in its soft form for decorations or cake coverings, you can store it in the refrigerator, but it is advisable to consume it within 24 hours.
If you prefer, you can add a few drops of colorant as the meringue begins to cool. It is preferable to use powdered or gel colorants. You can also add natural extracts like vanilla, lemon, or almond for an extra flavor touch.
