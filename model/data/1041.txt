To prepare the grilled tomahawk, first take the meat out of the fridge and let it come to room temperature for at least an hour. Prepare the aromatic salt: place the peeled garlic cloves in a blender along with the juniper berries and the peppercorns .
Add the coarse salt , clarified butter , and bay leaves .
Finally, add the sage and rosemary and blend to obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Rub the meat with the aromatic salt to season it well on all sides . Now proceed with cooking: place the steak on the hot grill and sear it for 10 minutes, ensuring the flame is not too intense .
After 10 minutes, use tongs to turn the meat perpendicularly on the grill and sear it this way for another 5 minutes . At this point, turn it to the other side and let it cook for another 10 minutes , then position it perpendicularly on the other side and sear for another 5 minutes. The internal temperature should reach 130°F-140°F.
Once cooked, transfer the steak to a grill placed over a tray , cover with a sheet of aluminum foil , and let it rest in a warm place for about 10 minutes. This way, the meat will heat evenly, and the juices will distribute inside. Your grilled tomahawk is ready to be enjoyed !
It's recommended to consume the grilled tomahawk immediately.
If you wish, you can prepare the salt the day before so that the flavors are better absorbed.
The best cooking for this cut of meat is medium-rare with an internal temperature of 130°F-140°F. If you prefer, you can cook it rare (120°F-130°F) or well done (150°F-160°F), but in the latter case, it will tend to toughen.
Letting the steak rest after cooking is very important because it prevents blood from oozing on the plate and helps reach the right temperature inside.
We used Clarified butter because it has a higher smoke point than regular butter, making it more suitable for the high temperatures of the grill. If you prefer, you can replace it with a smaller amount of regular butter or extra virgin olive oil. Alternatively, you can omit the fats, but in this case, the meat will be drier on the outside.
You can customize the aromatic salt to your liking!
