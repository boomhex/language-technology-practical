instructions:
To prepare the brioche bread with arugula and potatoes, first wash the potato and boil it . It will take about 30 minutes. When poking it with a fork it feels soft, drain it and let it cool slightly. In the meantime, prepare the arugula cream. Wash and drain it well. Transfer it to a mixer bowl, add the oil and blend everything until you get a smooth cream .
At this point, peel the potato, transfer it to a bowl and mash it ; you will get 6 oz. In a large bowl, transfer the flour and brown sugar .
Add the mashed potato and the refreshed sourdough from the day before . Also add the water .
Work with your hands for a few seconds . Then add the egg and work again with your hands until you get a smooth and elastic dough .
Add the arugula sauce and work the dough with your hands for about 5 minutes . Then add the salt and work it for another couple of minutes.
Cover with plastic wrap . After 15 minutes, make the first of 3 folds. Take an outer edge of the dough and bring it towards the center. Rotate the bowl, take another edge of the dough and bring it towards the center. Repeat this operation for a total of 4 folds or overlaps. Then cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 4 hours at room temperature.
Then take the dough , transfer it to a floured surface and gently spread it with your hands to form a rectangle about 6x4 inches. At this point, bring the upper side towards the center and the lower side over it .
Turn the dough and repeat this operation by gently stretching the dough with your hands . Then lengthen the dough and roll it out using a rolling pin . You should get a rectangle 8x6 inches, 0.4 inches thick.
Then roll up the rectangle of dough and seal the outer edges well by pinching them with your fingers . Transfer into a 9x3 inch loaf pan that has been previously oiled .
Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 2 hours at room temperature. Place the dough in the refrigerator and let it mature for another 9 hours. Then remove it from the fridge, take off the plastic wrap and leave it at room temperature for an hour. Use a brush to oil the surface and sprinkle with poppy seeds .
Using a sharp knife, make decorative incisions . Bake in a preheated static oven at 355°F on the central rack for 40 minutes. Then remove from the oven , let it cool slightly before removing from the mold and serving .
The brioche bread with arugula and potatoes keeps for 3 days at room temperature, well covered. Alternatively, it can be frozen after baking.
The arugula sauce can be replaced with baby spinach sauce, using the same weight. You can add nuts such as walnuts, peanuts, or pistachios to the dough to make it even more delicious.
