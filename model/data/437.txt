instructions:
To prepare spinach dumplings, first boil the spinach, then drain and squeeze them well. Let them cool and, in the meantime, also prepare the Vegetable broth . At this point, cut the stale bread into cubes and place it in a bowl. Add the milk and let it soak. Meanwhile, transfer the spinach to a cutting board .
Chop them finely with a knife and set aside. Peel the onion and chop it finely as well . Heat a little oil in a pan and add the onion .
Let the onion soften for a few minutes, then turn off the heat . Add the chopped spinach and the flour to the bowl with the bread.
Add the eggs , grated Asiago cheese , salt, pepper , and a grating of nutmeg.
Then also add the warm onions and mix with a wooden spoon , or with your hands. You should obtain a homogeneous mixture .
Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. After this time, you can form the dumplings, shaping them into round shapes, similar to meatballs ; you will get about 12 with these amounts. Heat the vegetable broth and salt it if necessary , then bring it to a boil.
Meanwhile, heat a pat of butter in a pan, add some sage leaves , and let them infuse over low heat. Cook the dumplings in the now hot broth for about 10 minutes, or until they are tender . Then drain them and quickly sauté them in the sauce .
Plate the spinach dumplings , drizzle with the cooking sauce , and, if desired, sprinkle with grated Parmigiano Reggiano DOP !
Raw spinach dumplings can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one day. Once cooked, they can be kept in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
Allow the mixture to cool well; it will be easier to form the dumplings. If you prefer, you can serve the dumplings in the vegetable broth used for cooking them, without sautéing them in butter.
