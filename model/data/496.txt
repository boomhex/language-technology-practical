instructions:
To prepare the zucchini guacamole, first wash and trim the zucchinis, then cut them into slices . Transfer the zucchinis to a mixer and add the cilantro leaves .

Blend until you obtain a creamy mixture . Pour the puree into a sieve lined with paper towels and press to remove excess liquid . Once drained, transfer the cream to a bowl .
Season with a generous drizzle of oil and a grind of pepper , then adjust the salt and mix well .
Finally, add the diced tomatoes and mix them into the cream . Your zucchini guacamole is ready to be served, perhaps garnished with a few slices of lime !
The zucchini guacamole can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
For this recipe, we recommend using small and light zucchinis because they are more suitable for eating raw.
If you don't like the taste of cilantro, you can replace it with parsley.
