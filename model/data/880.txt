instructions:
To prepare your tricolor sandwich, start with the peppers. Place them on a baking sheet and bake in a preheated static oven at 392 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes (or until they become dark). Once done, remove them and peel off the dark roasted skin with your fingers , then rinse the residues with water in the sink .
Remove the upper part of the pepper, then cut it in half and split each half into three parts . Set aside and take care of the bread, brush it with oil, and heat a non-stick pan .
Toast the slices of bread on both sides , it will take just a few minutes , then keep it warm. Let the stracciatella drain in a strainer. Now take the avocado and cut it in half lengthwise .

Remove the pit and peel off the skin . Slice it thinly and set it aside in a bowl, pouring the lemon juice over it.
Now you can assemble your sandwich: start by placing two slices of pepper on a slice of bread , add 1/4 of the stracciatella and 5 slices of avocado .
Season with salt and pepper , then place another slice of bread on top , continue with a second layer of peppers, stracciatella
and avocado . Close with a final slice of bread . Your gluten-free tricolor sandwich is ready to be enjoyed .
We recommend consuming the gluten-free tricolor sandwich immediately. You can prepare the peppers in advance.
Instead of roasting them in the oven, the peppers can also be grilled on a hot grill plate.
