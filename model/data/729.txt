instructions:
To make wonton soup, start with the dumpling dough: pour the flour into a bowl, then add the salt and water . Knead everything by hand, first in the bowl and then on the work surface .
You should obtain a mixture that is not only smooth and homogeneous, but also quite firm and compact . Transfer the dough into the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for about 10 minutes . Meanwhile, chop the green part of a scallion and focus on the filling.
Put the ground meat in a bowl and add the rice wine , scallion , salt, and pepper. Mix with chopsticks or a spoon to blend the filling well .
Take the dough and divide it in half, then roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured surface . Use a pasta machine to get very thin sheets, taking care to flour them as you go . Then cut out squares of 3-4 inches per side .
You are ready to form the dumplings: place a square of dough on the palm of your hand and spread a teaspoon of filling in the center , then fold the square to form a triangle . Further fold the base of the triangle to seal the filling inside, taking care to leave the edges free .
Turn the 2 ends and overlap them, using a little water to make them stick well . The first dumpling is ready : proceed in this way to form all the others. Alternatively, you can close them as if they were little bags. At this point, bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the dumplings for 4-5 minutes .
Meanwhile, prepare the broth directly in the serving dishes: put a pinch of salt , a pinch of pepper , and 2 ladles of boiling water in each bowl.
Add some lettuce, which you have previously cut into strips . Drain the dumplings into the dish and add chopped scallion .
Finally, season with sesame oil and, if desired, soy sauce . Your wonton soup is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to consume wonton soup immediately.
The dumplings can be prepared in advance and stored in the freezer, to be cooked directly from frozen.
If you wish, you can flavor the filling with some fresh ginger.
Instead of rice wine, you can use white wine.
The broth can be customized with the spices and vegetables of your choice!
For an even more authentic touch, you can complete the dish with strips of omelet.
