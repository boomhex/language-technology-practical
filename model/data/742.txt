instructions:
To prepare the plum jam, wash the plums thoroughly under running water and remove the pit. Cut them into pieces . Once the pit is removed, you'll get about 2 lbs of pulp. Place the plums in a pot and pour in the sugar and lemon juice , then start cooking on low heat.
Stir occasionally to prevent sticking to the bottom. Continue cooking until the jam thickens well , it will take about an hour. To check the cooking, perform the plate test: pour a teaspoon of jam onto a plate and let it cool. Tilt the plate and check if the jam stays firm and doesn't slide: in this case, it's ready; otherwise, continue cooking for a few more minutes and test the consistency again in the same way.
When it has thickened , pour the jam while still hot into previously sterilized jars and close with the lid . Turn the jars upside down on a cloth while they are still hot and let them cool in this position, this will help create a vacuum seal. Always check that a vacuum has been created and maintained over time: if the lid makes a click-clack sound at the center, it means the vacuum has not been created.
Plum jam can be kept for about 3 months, provided the vacuum seal has been properly achieved and the jars are stored in a cool, dry place, away from light and heat sources.
Once opened, it is recommended to store the jar in the refrigerator and consume it within 3-4 days maximum.
Plum jam can be enriched with a tablespoon of ground cinnamon added during the last 5 minutes of cooking.
The homemade preparation of preserves and jams can present health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the conditions and measures necessary to ensure food safety and suitability, which, on the other hand, industrial procedures can guarantee to prevent dangerous contamination. It is therefore important to strictly follow food safety guidelines to reduce risks, but it must always be kept in mind that the same level of food safety present in professionally produced preserves and jams can never be achieved. For proper preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the Ministry of Health guidelines .
