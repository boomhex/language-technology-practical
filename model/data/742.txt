To prepare the layer cake, first make the 3 bases. In a bowl, pour the flour, sifted baking powder , a pinch of salt , and mix .
In another large bowl, add the butter in pieces (at room temperature) and the sugar. Work with electric whisks until you get a cream , then with the mixers still running, pour the seed oil in a thin stream . The butter will make for a tasty cake with a soft texture, while the oil will keep the cake moist longer.
Add the seeds you have taken from the vanilla bean and continue to whip everything . Then add the eggs one at a time , followed by the two egg whites.
Mix until they are well incorporated . Pour the flour in 3 batches , alternating with some buttermilk . At this stage, set the whisks at low speed to avoid overworking the batter.
Continue to mix at low speed until you get a homogeneous mixture . Then transfer it to 3 previously greased 8-inch molds with parchment paper on the base . Level the surface well and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 25 minutes.
Then remove from the oven and let cool . Meanwhile, prepare the frosting. Pour the soft butter into a bowl and add the cream cheese .
Add the grated lemon zest and mix with electric whisks for 3 minutes . Add the sifted powdered sugar in 3 batches .
Always mix with electric whisks between additions until you get a smooth and thick cream . Once the bases are cold, remove them from the molds and level the top .
Add a generous layer of frosting, spreading it well with a spatula . Make sure to put more on the edges to create a sort of hollow that you will fill with jam . Now add some raspberries, breaking them with your hands .
Place a second cake layer on top and create another layer of cream and one of jam. Add some more raspberries and cover with the last cake layer, flipping it, so that the part that was at the base of the pan goes upwards .
Using a spatula, place the frosting on the top of the cake and the edges, leveling and smoothing it well, to cover it entirely but putting just a thin layer on the sides . Transfer the remaining cream into a pastry bag with an oblique nozzle and decorate the surface of the cake .
Decorate with fresh raspberries , gold leaf and place in the fridge until it's time to serve your layer cake !
We recommend storing the layer cake in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days.
The 3 bases can be prepared in advance and frozen.
Instead of raspberries, you can also use currants.
If you can't find buttermilk, you can mix milk and yogurt together, or make it yourself using our How to make buttermilk !
If you don't have 3 8-inch molds, you can use a single tall one and then cut the layers once the cake is baked and cold.
