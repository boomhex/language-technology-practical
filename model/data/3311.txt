instructions:
To prepare the squid ink gnocchi, start by scrubbing and washing the potatoes thoroughly. Then, boil them with the skin on in salted water . Once cooked, peel them while still hot, pass them through a sieve , and let them cool. Then, place them in a large bowl and add the flour ,
the salt and the squid ink , then knead everything well until you obtain a soft and dry mixture (add a little more flour if the mixture is sticky).
On a floured surface, form dough cords , which you will cut into pieces the size of a hazelnut or slightly larger ; you can leave the gnocchetti in this shape, or make them round or roll them over the tines of a fork to give them the classic ridged shape. Place the gnocchi on a floured surface or tray . Let your squid ink gnocchi rest for 15 minutes, then cook them in a fairly large pot with salted water and drain them when they float to the surface. Prepare the sauce you prefer and dress your gnocchi.
