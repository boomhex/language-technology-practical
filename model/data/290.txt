instructions:
To prepare the risotto with broccoli and quick bagna caoda, first clean the Romanesco broccoli , then plunge the florets into a pot with boiling salted water and blanch them for about 4-5 minutes. Drain the broccoli into a bowl with cold ice water . Reserve and keep the cooking water warm because it will be needed to cook the risotto.
Transfer the broccoli to a container, taking care to set some aside for plating, then add the oil , lemon juice , and salt. Blend with an immersion blender .
You should obtain a smooth and homogeneous cream . Set aside and move on to the bagna caoda sauce: gently melt the butter along with the anchovies in a small saucepan.
Add a quarter of a grated garlic clove , then pour in the cream and let it reduce over low heat for a few minutes .
Now focus on cooking the risotto: pour the rice into a saucepan , salt it, and toast it dry, stirring continuously. When the grains are very hot to the touch, deglaze with the white wine and let it completely evaporate. Begin cooking the rice by adding one ladle at a time of the broccoli cooking water , always waiting for the liquid to be absorbed before adding the next one.
Towards mid-cooking, add the broccoli cream and finish cooking the rice . Once cooked, turn off the heat and stir in the grated pecorino and Parmesan .
Add the well-cold butter as well and let the risotto rest for a couple of minutes covered with a cloth before mixing well . At this point, you can plate the broccoli risotto and garnish it with the anchovy sauce .
Complete with the reserved florets , pieces of anchovy, and a grind of pepper . Your risotto with broccoli and quick bagna caoda is ready to serve !
It is recommended to consume the risotto with broccoli and quick bagna caoda as soon as it is ready; if necessary, you can store it for one day in the refrigerator.
You can prepare the broccoli cream and anchovy sauce in advance and store them in the refrigerator for one day.
If you prefer, you can replace Romanesco broccoli with green broccoli!
For a milder bagna caoda sauce, you can add the whole garlic clove and then remove it at the end of cooking.
Instead of Vialone Nano rice, you can use Carnaroli rice.
