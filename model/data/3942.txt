To prepare the bananas flambé, start by squeezing the orange and straining the juice . Then take a non-stick pan and put it on the heat to melt the sugar .
When it starts to caramelize , achieving a dark blonde color, add the butter . As soon as the butter has melted, add the whole peeled bananas to the pan over low heat for 1-2 minutes . Turn them gently on both sides to avoid breaking, making sure they absorb heat evenly.
At this point, add the rum and let it catch fire, slightly tilting the pan towards the flame or using a culinary torch. When the flames have died down completely, remove the bananas from the pan and set them aside. In the remaining caramel in the pan, add the orange juice and emulsify with a wooden spoon. Then put the bananas back in the pan and cook them again, turning them for even cooking .
Now that the bananas are cooked, cut half a banana into slices and arrange it on a dessert plate. Place the other banana alongside the sliced one and pour the caramel sauce over both . You can serve leaving the flambéed banana whole or cutting it, entirely or partially, into slices to place alongside each other for an elegant presentation of the fruit. You can also serve these delicious bananas flambé with a scoop of vanilla or chocolate ice cream.
It is recommended to consume the banana flambé immediately after cooking. Freezing is not recommended.
How to recognize the perfect banana? Slightly under-ripe and free of any black spots.
Extra tip: once the bananas are roasted, for a classy serving, you can't do without orange peels: cut them into julienne strips and blanch them in the cooking liquid, they are the ideal accompaniment to balance the flavor of the dish!
Bananas flambé is a classic preparation that is usually performed in restaurants in front of the customer, to make it more impressive, with a special burner designed specifically for flambéing, the so-called “lamp.”
