Start by roasting the peppers: place them on a sheet of parchment paper and bake them in a hot oven at 482°F for about 20 minutes, turning them from time to time. When the peppers are well roasted, place them while still hot in a plastic food bag to make peeling easier. Close the bag tightly and let the peppers "sweat" for at least 10 minutes, after which you can peel them, removing the stem and white filaments, and then cut them into strips about 1 inch wide . Cut the Lucanian scamorza into sticks about 1 inch wide
and wrap the pepper strips around them to form small rolls that you will then close with a toothpick. Grease a small baking dish with some olive oil , place the rolls in it, and sprinkle them with the previously minced garlic, breadcrumbs , pecorino cheese, and a bit of oregano. Drizzle again with a little olive oil and bake the rolls for 10 minutes at 392°F, until the scamorza has melted. Complete the recipe by placing each roll on a "La Bottega di Olivia&Marino" Flatbread and serve the snacks while they're still hot!
