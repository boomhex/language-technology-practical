instructions:
To prepare the cordon bleu with air fryer, cut the Gruyère cheese into slices about 0.4 inches thick . Place a slice of chicken breast on the cutting board, lay a slice of cooked ham on top , and then 2 slices of Gruyère .
Cover with another slice of chicken breast . The amount of cheese and ham inserted should be such that the chicken slices touch each other to seal the edges and prevent the filling from leaking during cooking . Pass the cordon bleu in flour .
Then dip it in the beaten egg , followed by the breadcrumbs . This will yield 4 cordon bleu .
Lightly grease the cordon bleu with oil using a brush . Place in the air fryer (we used a fryer with a 6-liter capacity) and cook at 383°F for 16 minutes, turning them halfway through cooking .
Once ready , transfer them to a plate, season with salt , and immediately serve the cordon bleu with air fryer .
We recommend consuming the cordon bleu with air fryer immediately, to enjoy the crispy breading and the melty filling. If you have leftovers, store them in the fridge and consume them within a couple of days.
Cordon bleu is lightly greased before cooking to prevent the breading from drying out excessively, you can also use a spray bottle to mist the oil.
We used medium-thick slices, using thinner slices could shorten the cooking time.
