instructions:
Fried pecorino is this beloved treat from Central Italy, especially in Tuscany and Sardinia—regions super serious about their cheese. And there's just something magical about how fried pecorino turns crispy yet gooey. Seriously good. Use a less aged pecorino and you'll get that melting, stringy bite straight from the pan. But if you go for a more mature cheese, expect golden, crunchy chips—perfect for dipping. And the sauce? A smooth fava bean cream adds a tender, earthy flavor. Balances out that salty punch.
Italian families, you know, have a knack for turning simple, quality ingredients into comforting, elegant dishes. You might see this as a fried cheese appetizer at a picnic or a chill dinner. Works great in both. In Sardinia and Tuscany, folks love experimenting with the cheese's age. It's a really really good mix—soft, moist slices with crispy bits all on one plate.
The pecorino cheese recipes here often highlight what's fresh. Like in spring, there's an abundance of fava beans. That's when the creamy, sweet fava bean puree shines. And listen, you can scoop the warm cheese into the fava bean dip or spread it on crusty bread if you're in the mood. Perfect for sunny outdoor gatherings. And cozy indoor moments.
The Mediterranean vibe—it is all about sharing, relaxing and letting those tangy cheese flavors and mild beans work their magic. Every bite feels rustic, satisfying, and honestly, pretty simple to enjoy. No matter the setting or occasion, it's always a hit. Cannot go wrong.
To prepare the Fried Pecorino with Fava Bean Cream, start with the latter. First, blanch the fava beans in boiling salted water for about 5 minutes. Then drain them and cool under running water . Remove the skin from each bean and place them in a mixer cup.
Add the oil , a squeeze of lemon , a pinch of salt, and black pepper .
Also add the garlic clove, deprived of its core and chopped into small pieces . Blend everything until you obtain a cream . If it turns out too solid, add a bit of water.
Place in a jar and set aside. Move on to the Pecorino, slice it approximately 1/16 inch thick . Then pour the rice flour into a small bowl and beat the egg in another .
At this point, place a pan with oil on the heat and warm it up to 338°F. Meanwhile, pass the Pecorino slices first in the egg and then in the rice flour (14-15), to create a very light breading.
Immerse a few pieces at a time and fry them for 2-3 minutes until they are well golden, then drain them and transfer them to a tray lined with paper towels . Finish frying the Pecorino chips and serve them with the fava bean cream !
It is recommended to consume the Fried Pecorino immediately.
The fava bean cream can be stored for 1-2 days in the refrigerator.
Removing the skin from each bean allows you to achieve a cream with a bright color and smoother texture; but if you prefer, you can skip this step and add a bit more lemon juice; otherwise, use them for a vegetable broth!
If you prefer, you can omit the garlic; alternatively, you can use peas instead of fava beans.
Instead of rice flour, you can use semolina.
