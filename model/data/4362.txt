Watermelon sorbet is a fresh and delicious summer dessert, perfect for closing a dinner with taste and lightness during the warmer months. Here we rediscover watermelon, an iconic fruit that has always been recognized as a symbol of this season, in a new and captivating form: a homemade sorbet accessible to everyone, which is made with only 4 ingredients, or, if you prefer a richer version, you can also try your hand at the recipe for watermelon sorbet with egg whites . Let yourself be tempted by this spoon dessert and discover all the other flavors you can make at home:
To prepare the watermelon sorbet, take the watermelon , remove the rind and obtain 600 g (about 1.3 lbs) of pulp. With a spoon, scoop out the inner pulp with the seeds , then cut the rest into cubes .
Pass only the pulp with the seeds through a sieve to obtain only the liquid part . Now in a jug, pour the pulp cubes, the sugar , and the previously filtered watermelon juice .
Add the lemon juice and blend everything with an immersion blender until the sugar is dissolved .
Pour the mixture into the ice cream maker and let it churn until you get a creamy sorbet , which will take about 20-30 minutes, depending on the type of ice cream maker. Serve the watermelon sorbet well chilled and enjoy immediately .
Store your sorbet in the freezer for 3-4 days, placed in an airtight container.
If you don't have an ice cream maker, place the mixture in a bowl and put it in the freezer, remembering to break it up with a fork every half hour until you achieve the right creaminess and density for your sorbet. It will take about 3 hours.
