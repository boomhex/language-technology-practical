instructions:
To prepare the air fryer struffoli, start by sifting the flour onto the work surface to form the classic fountain shape, then add the salt , sugar , and baking soda .
Cut the butter into cubes and place it in the center . Start kneading with your hands , then pour in the first 2 eggs .
Mix with a fork to absorb them , then add the third egg . Continue kneading, then add the yolks .
Now flavor with the anise liqueur , lemon zest , and orange zest, both grated. Start working the dough with your hands or with the help of a dough scraper .
Knead until you get a smooth and homogeneous dough . Wrap the dough with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. After resting, take a part of the dough , making sure to keep the rest well covered. Form logs about 0.4 inches thick .
Using the dough scraper, cut into pieces about 0.4-0.6 inches and set them aside, spacing them well apart . Line the air fryer basket with perforated parchment paper, spray with seed oil, and place some of the struffoli inside, spacing them apart . Using a 6-liter capacity air fryer, you'll need to do 3-4 batches.
Cook in the air fryer at 375°F for 7 minutes, turning them a couple of times. When they are well golden , lay them on a tray to cool and continue cooking the others. Once all the struffoli are cooked, cut the candied orange into cubes . In a separate pan, pour the honey and sugar .
Heat over low heat, stirring occasionally. As soon as it starts to boil, turn off the heat. Let cool slightly and add lemon zest and orange zest , both grated. Add the candied orange cubes , saving some for decoration, and mix again.
Let cool for a total of 5-6 minutes, then add the struffoli inside . Mix well with a wooden spoon until the struffoli are well coated and have cooled . Transfer your air fryer struffoli onto a serving plate and garnish with colorful sprinkles, candied cherries, and the reserved candied orange cubes !
Store the air fryer struffoli under a glass dome for 4-5 days. Freezing is not recommended.
If you don't have or don't like anise, you can easily substitute it with limoncello or any liqueur of your choice! Alternatively, it can be replaced with orange juice.
