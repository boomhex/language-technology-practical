Savory pastiera is a totally unique twist on Naples’ beloved Easter dessert. Instead of sweet orange blossom, it's got something way more unexpected. People in Campania took the classic idea and created a Neapolitan savory pie that's just bursting with tender wheat and sheep’s ricotta. And look, the local cheeses like caciocavallo and pecorino romano make it really, really rich. You still get that creamy, moist filling everyone goes crazy for, but this time it’s loaded with bits of salami. Super tasty.
The crust? It's a shortcrust pastry. But not sweet. It's all about that crispy, golden, slightly crumbly texture that pairs perfectly with the hearty filling. In Naples, this Italian Easter pie is a big hit during the holidays, especially for family meals or the Easter Monday picnic, known as Pasquetta. Every slice of savory pastiera hits this sweet spot between traditional comfort food and something totally new.
And the cheeses? They melt into the ricotta and wheat, creating a mix of soft and cheesy in every bite. Seriously good. The salami elevates it with a meaty, smoky flavor. So good. There are different versions in Campania—sometimes with more pecorino for sharpness, or with bits of ham instead of salami—but it always keeps that balance of creamy and savory that's essential.
As a starter or centerpiece at a spring table, pastiera salata is a real conversation starter. And here's the thing, it's traditional enough to honor the past, yet original enough to get people talking. Try this savory pastiera recipe when you want something that shows off the best of Neapolitan tradition in a fresh way. It's all about mixing the rustic flavors of southern Italy with a rich, satisfying taste that makes you want to grab another slice. For sure. Anyone who's into Italian Easter pie or just loves savory Italian baking will find this a pretty special addition to the table. Plus, it is great for those who appreciate a blend of history and innovation in their holiday dishes.

To prepare the savory pastiera, start by pouring the flour , sugar , and salt into the mixer.
Add the cold butter in pieces . Blend until you get a sandy mixture . Add the eggs .
Mix again for a few moments . Finally, transfer to the counter and knead by hand until you obtain a dough ball .
Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in the fridge for 1 hour . Meanwhile, pour the wheat into a saucepan with milk and butter .
Turn on the stove and cook over high heat, stirring often to prevent sticking . It will take about 10 minutes for the wheat to dry out, then you can transfer it to a bowl. Let it cool completely . In a large bowl, combine the sheep's ricotta and eggs .
Mix a little with the whisk and then add the cooled wheat , the diced salami and caciocavallo cheese .
Also, add the grated pecorino , salt, and pepper and mix well. If you find the mixture too dry, add a little milk to adjust the consistency.
Take the shortcrust pastry and work it for a few minutes with the rolling pin to make it pliable again. Take a piece large enough to be rolled out to a thickness of about 1/4 inch . Then line a tapered mold, greased and floured, measuring 10.5 inches on the surface and 8.5 inches at the base. Roll it out with the help of the rolling pin inside and remove the excess with a small knife .
Prick the base and edges with a fork and pour the filling in the middle, leveling carefully . Finally, knead the leftover savory shortcrust pastry pieces with the saved piece and roll out again to obtain 7 strips. Arrange the first 4
and then the other 3 in the opposite direction to create the typical lattice. Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 60 minutes . Cut the savory pastiera when it's well cooled and enjoy .
The savory pastiera can be stored in the fridge for 3 days.
It can be frozen after baking.
Just like the classic one, the savory pastiera couldn't miss the sheep's ricotta, which is very tasty, just like the cheeses we suggested. If you prefer a milder flavor for your savory pastiera, substitute with cow's ricotta, sweet provolone, and grated Parmesan.
The consistency of the whole wheat will make your savory pastiera more rustic, if you prefer a smoother texture, you can blend or pass both the wheat and the ricotta through a sieve.
