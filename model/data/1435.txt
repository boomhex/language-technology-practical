instructions:
To prepare Marsala escalopes, first, place the meat slices between two sheets of parchment paper and pound them with a meat tenderizer to flatten and elongate them at the same time until they are very thin : this will make the meat more tender and less fibrous. Flour the slices and remove the excess flour.
Once all the slices are floured , move to the stove: in a large pan, gently melt the butter with the oil , then slightly raise the heat and add the floured slices .
After a couple of minutes, turn them with kitchen tongs and sear them briefly on the other side , then raise the heat and deglaze with Marsala . Add salt and pepper .
At this point, pour in the vegetable broth (or water as an alternative) and continue to cook for a few more minutes, swirling the pan occasionally to create a delicious emulsion. When the sauce has become nicely creamy , plate and serve your tasty Marsala escalopes !
It is recommended to consume the escalopes immediately as the meat tends to harden once cooked. If necessary, you can store them in the refrigerator for 1-2 days, covered with their sauce. Freezing is not recommended.
As an alternative to pork, you can use veal or chicken following the same recipe. If you want to soften the taste of the escalopes, you can add a few drops of honey towards the end of the preparation!
