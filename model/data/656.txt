instructions:
To prepare artichokes and potatoes, first clean the artichokes: remove the tougher outer leaves and cut off the tips . Peel the stem to make it more tender. Cut them in half and remove the inner choke , then cut them into wedges .
Peel the potatoes , wash them, and cut them in half and then each half into 4 wedges . Place them in a pot with cold water and bring to a boil .
When the water comes to a boil, add the artichokes and acidulate with a splash of lemon . Blanch them along with the potatoes for 5 minutes, then drain everything. Wash and chop the parsley and mint .
Mix breadcrumbs, mint, parsley , lemon zest, salt , and pepper in a bowl. Pour artichokes and potatoes into a baking dish greased with a little oil and distribute them evenly .
Cover with the breadcrumb mixture and drizzle with some oil . Bake in a static oven at 350°F for about 25 minutes. If desired, give it a few minutes under the grill to brown it to your liking. Artichokes and potatoes are ready to be enjoyed .
Consume within the day, cooked artichokes are very delicate.
For a more robust breadcrumb mixture, you can add garlic and chili pepper. Add smoked cheese during the grill minutes for a tastier dish.
