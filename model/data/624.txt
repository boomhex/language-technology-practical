instructions:
To prepare the scialatielli with asparagus and clams, the first thing you need to do is purge the clams: place them in a bowl with water and salt and leave them to soak for 2 hours, changing the water several times. After this time, drain the clams . In a pan, pour a drizzle of oil, a chili pepper, a crushed garlic clove, and parsley stalks .
Let it simmer and add the clams . Deglaze with some white wine and cover with a lid .
As soon as the clams have fully opened up , turn off the heat and strain the cooking liquid . Shell most of the clams and keep their water aside .
Now move on to the asparagus: clean them by removing the white part of the stalk with a knife . Immerse the asparagus in boiling salted water and cook for a few minutes until they are tender. Now drain them using tongs , without discarding the cooking water.
Immediately immerse them in ice water . Cut them into pieces and transfer them into a tall, narrow container. Add lemon juice .
Also add some clam water and blend everything together : adjust the amount of water to get a smooth and creamy consistency . If necessary, pass the cream through a sieve.
Bring the asparagus cooking water back to a boil and cook the scialatielli in it . When they are very al dente, drain them into a pan where you have poured a drizzle of oil . Finish cooking by adding the clam water .
Also add the asparagus cream . Finally, add the clams, both shelled and unshelled . Toss to mix everything well .
Plate the scialatielli , garnish with chopped parsley and grated lemon zest . The scialatielli with asparagus and clams are ready to be served !
We recommend consuming the scialatielli with asparagus and clams immediately.
Keep some asparagus tips aside for plating!
