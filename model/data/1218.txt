instructions:
Scialatielli with lemon, buffalo mozzarella, and prawns is that dish that really steals the show during big holiday meals in Southern Italy. And i mean, it is got everything. This pasta comes straight from the Amalfi Coast —where folks love these tender, ribbon-like noodles that grab onto sauce so well. And look, what makes this scialatielli recipe pop is the sharp, zesty kick of local lemons mingling with creamy, fresh Mozzarella di Bufala Campana. You get strips of cheese that start to melt—wrapping around the pasta and prawns—so every bite is extra moist and packed with flavor. Can't go wrong with that. Instead of feeling heavy, the dish has this light, almost tangy taste, thanks to the lemon butter sauce soaking into each strand. The big, sweet mazzancolle prawns make it a true Italian seafood pasta that feels both special and comforting.
Buffalo mozzarella pasta dishes like this one always bring to mind the warmth and brightness of Campania. Especially around Christmas or New Year's. And the lemon pasta flavor isn’t just a background note. Oh no, it really shines—giving the whole thing a fresh vibe that stands out from those heavier pasta dishes. This prawn pasta is elegant, but honestly, it's not tough to pull off. Seriously good. Even for those wanting to add something special to the table. The tartare of prawns brings a soft, almost buttery texture, and when it blends with the silky sauce and melting cheese, the combo is just right.
In Campania, they sometimes swap in clams or asparagus for a twist. Which is great. But the original scialatielli with lemon, mozzarella and prawns? Always a hit. It's the kind of Mediterranean pasta dish that lets simple, quality ingredients do all the talking—making you look like a real pro. Even if you are just hanging out at home with friends and family. To be honest, this is Southern Italian comfort food that's as festive as it gets. And it never fails to make any meal feel a little more special.
To prepare the lemon scialatielli with buffalo mozzarella and prawns, let's start from the Scialatielli . Finely chop the basil leaves with a knife . Then, in a bowl, pour the semolina and the egg , mix and add the pecorino and the basil .
Continue to mix while you add the milk and then the oil . As soon as the dough has taken shape, transfer it to the work surface and smooth it out .
Then wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature . In the meantime, focus on cleaning the prawns. Separate the back from the rest of the body while trying to also remove the intestine . Remove the shell and legs, then cut into pieces of about 0.6 inches .
Gather the pieces in a bowl and season with oil and pepper . Mix and set aside (stir occasionally) . Grate the lemon zest
and squeeze the juice . Now that everything is ready, bring the water to a boil to cook the pasta and focus on that. Roll it out thinly on a slightly floured wooden board with semolina, achieving a thickness of 0.2 inches and then fold the side edges towards the center, dusting again .
Cut sharply and obtain strands about 6 inches long . The water should be boiling by now, drop the scialatielli and let them cook . In the meantime, heat a saucepan over low heat and add the butter .
Add the salt, pepper , and lemon juice , and shake the pan slightly to emulsify .
As soon as the scialatielli are cooked, drain them into the pan ; adjust the consistency with a bit of pasta water if needed . Proceed with plating: pour the pasta, garnish with some strips of buffalo mozzarella
the prawns, a bit of lemon zest , a few fresh oregano leaves, and a pinch of pepper . Here are the lemon scialatielli with buffalo mozzarella and prawns ready: enjoy your meal !
Any form of storage is discouraged to better appreciate the flavors and textures of the lemon scialatielli with buffalo mozzarella and prawns.
The flavors and aromas of the lemon scialatielli with buffalo mozzarella and prawns dish are very balanced. A good tip for you: When you clean the prawns, if you can't completely remove the intestine, you can resort to this method: cut into chunks as per the recipe and then clean with the help of a toothpick.
