instructions:
To prepare the mustard vinaigrette, take a large bowl in which you will pour the salt . Dissolve it with the vinegar using a hand whisk. Alternatively, you can use the balloon whisk or an immersion blender. While whisking, add the mustard and mix the ingredients well.
Emulsify with the extra virgin olive oil in a thin stream . Adjust with salt and pepper and continue whisking until the vinaigrette is homogeneous: the oil should be completely emulsified with the vinegar and mustard. At this point, your mustard vinaigrette is ready to use .
It is recommended to use the mustard vinaigrette as soon as it is ready, as the liquid part (vinegar) and the oily part (oil) will tend to separate over time.
Alternatively, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Place it in a tightly sealed glass jar. Before using it, emulsify it again.
Freezing the mustard vinaigrette is not recommended.
For a more aromatic flavor, try perfuming your mustard vinaigrette with a chopped mix of herbs: thyme and dill if you want to dress fish, a very fine chop of sage and rosemary if you will add it to meat to flavor it. But you can always opt for the classic basil: the go-to of aromas!
It seems that the production of mustard as a food condiment has been regulated since 1390 in France. However, the first guild of mustard producers, the so-called "mustard makers," was only established in the 16th century, and from that moment, the appreciation of mustard saw constant growth.
