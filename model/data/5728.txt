A cocktail that conquers at the first sip thanks to its special texture and extraordinary blend of flavors. Its origin is unknown, but there are various legends surrounding its history. It seems that the Americano was born in the 1930s and that its name is dedicated to the Italian boxer Primo Carnera, very famous at that time in the USA. Considered the "father" of the Negroni , the cocktail owes part of its success also to cinematography, where it has often carved out important frames. The role we all remember? Held in the hands of James Bond in Casino Royale. The Americano is part of the official IBA cocktail list, the International Bartenders Association, and can be considered a true all-Italian pride, just like the Spritz .
