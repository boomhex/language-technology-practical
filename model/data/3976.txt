instructions:
To prepare malloreddus with Pecorino, start by cooking the pasta in boiling salted water according to the cooking times indicated on the package . Meanwhile, prepare the sauce by grating the fresh Sardinian pecorino cheese , then melt it in a double boiler, adding a bit of pasta cooking water to thin the cheese . Make sure the vessel containing the cheese does not touch the water in the pot below, otherwise, it will burn. Remember that a double boiler should always be used over low heat.
Mix with a whisk , this will result in a smooth, lump-free cream. Then, add the saffron powder and mix well with a spatula, ensuring the powder blends well with the cheese .
Drain the pasta and transfer it directly to the pan with the sauce, so as not to drain too much water . This will make the cheese softer. After mixing, add ground black pepper (or freshly ground, if you prefer) and let it infuse for a few moments.
Once the gnocchetti are soaked in the sauce, plate them, and grate a bit more cheese for decoration. Serve the malloreddus with pecorino immediately while still hot!
Consume the malloreddus with pecorino as soon as they're made, as the sauce tends to solidify quickly. Freezing is not recommended.
This dish shines with the flavor of Sardinia; for those who want to make it even more Sardinian, you can add strips of local ham or salami.
The dough used to make malloreddus is worked until it becomes smooth, then shaped into thin sticks, cut into small pieces, and rolled on the bottom of a basket (ciuliri) to form a hollow oval shell, characterized by parallel ridges on the back.
