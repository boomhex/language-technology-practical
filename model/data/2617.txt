Fougasse is a classic French bread from the stunning region of Provence. Seriously good stuff. This fougasse bread recipe is famous for its unique cuts that make it look like a wheat stalk, giving it a really distinctive look. When you bake homemade fougasse , your kitchen fills with the warm, inviting scent of fresh bread, making it impossible not to sneak a peek. In Provence, this French flatbread is celebrated not just for its taste but also for its artistic flair—so so crispy on the edges and a bit chewy inside. Locals often dress it up with olives or herbs, adding that main southern France touch.
And look, while it's somewhere between regular bread and focaccia, fougasse has a character all its own, both in appearance and flavor—tender and moist, perfect for tearing apart and sharing. Really.
In Provence, there are countless variations—sometimes you might find a fougasse with olives , or one with a bit of tangy cheese melted inside, depending on what's fresh and local. Thing is, it always looks elegant, as if you've spent hours crafting it. That’s the beauty of this traditional French bread ; it's pretty simple yet carries a special homemade charm. The scoring of the dough isn't just for aesthetics; those cuts help the loaf take shape and allow the crust to get extra crispy in spots, making each bite incredibly satisfying. Many folks consider it the ultimate artisan bread baking achievement, which is great.
And listen, if you're curious about Provençal bread or just want something chewy and impressive for dinner, fougasse brings a slice of southern France right to your table. It's a tasty experience for everyone gathered around. For real.
To make the fougasse, start by preparing the starter, or pre-dough: in a large bowl, pour the sifted flour, yeast , and then the water ; knead quickly by hand until you get a compact but not completely smooth dough .
Let the starter rest in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours covered with plastic wrap . After 12 hours, transfer it to an oiled work surface, then cut it into pieces placing them in a bowl with warm water to soften them .
Then proceed with preparing the dough: in a stand mixer equipped with a hook, pour the flour , oil , and warm water along with all the chopped starter .
Slowly start the hook for a few minutes and then add the salt ; continue with the stand mixer for 6-8 minutes until the dough has a smooth consistency and wraps around the hook . If the dough remains too soft and doesn’t detach from the sides, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of flour. Oil a large bowl
And pour the dough ; form a ball and let it rise for at least 1 hour in the oven turned off but with the light on, covering with plastic wrap . After the necessary time, transfer it onto a lightly floured (or oiled) work surface and then with a dough scraper divide it into two equal parts .
With each piece, create a rectangular shape and then on the work surface (or directly on a sheet of baking paper) roll out the dough one piece at a time with a rolling pin, forming two rectangles measuring 7x9 inches . With a dough scraper, make 5 cuts in the dough measuring 4 inches (which during baking will take the shape of a spike), leaving at least 3/4 inch from the edges: starting from the bottom, make two oblique cuts 5/8 inch apart, then continue with a central cut, and finally two more oblique side cuts on the opposite side .
Transfer the fougasse onto a baking tray lined with baking paper and with your fingers widen the cuts you have made, gently pulling the corners of the dough . Once finished , cover with plastic wrap avoiding contact (alternatively, you can also brush it with oil), allowing it to rise again for 45 minutes, always in the oven turned off but with the light on. Then, bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for 20-25 minutes (or 340°F for 15-18 minutes if using a convection oven): when the surface is well golden, remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack; finally, you can serve and enjoy your fougasse, accompanying it with cheese or cold cuts .
It is recommended to consume the fougasse within a few hours. You can store it in a paper bag for a couple of days at most; once dry, it can be cut in half and used as a crouton. It is possible to freeze the fougasse after baking it, and keep it for up to 20 days; it is recommended to thaw it slowly in the oven at a temperature of 250°F.
Accompany your fougasse with cold cuts and cheeses to enjoy it at its best! If you like, you can create a richer and tastier version of fougasse by adding olives, nuts, or aromatic herbs to the dough!
