instructions:
Before starting to prepare the ricotta shortcrust pastry, make sure to drain the whey from the ricotta by placing it in a fine mesh strainer and in the refrigerator, preferably overnight . Then sift the flour and pour it into a bowl, add the granulated sugar , a pinch of salt, and mix everything together .
Take the drained ricotta, sift it well, and add it to the flour and sugar mixture . Add the yolk and whole egg , knead everything with your hands very quickly .
When the ingredients have combined, transfer the mixture to a work surface and handle for a very short time , just to even out and compact . Form a loaf and wrap it in plastic wrap , then place it in the refrigerator for at least half an hour before using it.
The ricotta shortcrust can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Alternatively, it can be frozen for up to 1 month.
The ricotta shortcrust pastry is made without butter; therefore, it will not be as crunchy and crumbly as a classic shortcrust pastry.
To make cakes and desserts, you can proceed with blind baking for about ten minutes, let the base dry for a few minutes, and then fill as you prefer before continuing the baking for the remaining minutes.
To avoid the dough giving a "raw" effect after baking, drain the ricotta well overnight in the refrigerator so that the whey is eliminated and it becomes less moist!
