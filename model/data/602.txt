instructions:
To make the red lentil lentil tofu, first cover the lentils with hot water and let them soak for about 30 minutes . After this time, transfer the lentils with their water into a blender , add salt and blend at the highest speed; if necessary, add a little cold water and use a spatula to push the mixture towards the blades. You should achieve a smooth and homogeneous consistency .
Pour the puree into a non-stick pan and cook, stirring continuously until it becomes thick and sticky ; it will take about 10 minutes. Transfer the mixture into a glass container, level the surface well , and cover with a sheet of parchment paper in contact. Let it firm up in the refrigerator for about 5 hours.
Once firm , flip the block and remove the parchment paper, then cut it into cubes of the desired size : your red lentil lentil tofu is ready to be used !
You can store red lentil lentil tofu in the refrigerator for 4-5 days.
It can be frozen.
If you wish, you can flavor the lentil tofu by adding herbs or spices to taste, for example, parsley, curry, ginger, or tomato paste!
It's normal for the lentil mixture to stick to the bottom of the saucepan but it is important that it dries completely; otherwise, it won't firm up.
Try marinating the lentil tofu with oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, and zest, then pan-fry it!
