instructions:
To prepare the salmon and fruit poke bowl, let's start with cooking the rice. Pour it into a sieve and rinse it . Transfer it to a pot, cover with the indicated amount of water , season with salt, and bring to a boil .
Then cover with a lid wrapped in a clean cloth , lower the heat to the minimum, and let it cook for 10 minutes without opening or stirring: this way, it will be dry at the end of cooking . Once ready, remove the lid and let it rest for 5 minutes .
Meanwhile, cut the salmon fillet, skin removed, into cubes , season with sesame oil , salt, and lime juice .
Mix and move on to the avocado. Cut it in half, remove the pit , and scoop out the flesh with a spoon .
Cut the flesh into cubes , gather them in a bowl, and season with lime juice and vegetable oil .
Mix this as well and finally move on to the apple. Cut it in half, remove the core , and slice it thinly with a mandoline, or with a knife if you prefer .
All that's left is to assemble: in 4 small bowls - or possibly on a serving platter - gather the rice and salmon , avocado and apples , and garnish with black sesame seeds, soy sauce, and, if desired, with lime slices. Here is your salmon and fruit poke bowl ready .
Once your salmon and fruit poke bowl is ready, consume it immediately.
Add tuna cubes and even some coconut flakes to further enrich your salmon and fruit poke bowl!
Before consuming raw, marinated, or not perfectly cooked fish, it is recommended to freeze it for at least 96 hours at -18 degrees Celsius in a home freezer marked with 3 or more stars, as per Ministry of Health guidelines.
