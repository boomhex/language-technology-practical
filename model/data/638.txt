Chickpea masala brings that aromatic and tangy kick you expect from real Indian food. This chickpea masala recipe always stands out for its mix of spices —especially garam masala, a blend that shows up in kitchens all across India. And you know what? Although garam masala is often used for chicken dishes like tikka masala, it works amazingly with chickpeas, making each bite hearty and fresh. Really good stuff. The combination of coconut milk, onions, tomatoes and a touch of lime makes the whole thing pop with flavor. Coriander on top gives it that unmistakable, herby finish. People love this Indian chickpea curry for being both filling and pretty healthy, making it a staple for anyone wanting a true taste of vegetarian Indian cooking. Plus, it’s a dish you'll find just as often as a main meal or as a side, usually paired with fluffy basmati rice or naan to soak up every drop of sauce.
From North to South India, you'll find all kinds of takes on this chana masala recipe , but the basics stay the same: chickpeas and spices doing all the heavy lifting. Some regions lean into more spicy or sweet notes, but the backbone is always those slow-simmered garbanzo beans getting cozy with garam masala.

For anyone after a satisfying vegan meal, an easy chickpea masala checks all the boxes—it’s packed with protein, quick to put together, and big on flavor. Even people who usually go for meat dishes end up coming back to this spicy chickpea dish again and again. Seriously good.
