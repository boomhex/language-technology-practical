instructions:
To make the bandiera, first clean and slice the white onions . Cut the green peppers in half, remove the stem and seeds , then slice them into thin strips .
Now wash the tomatoes, cut them in half , remove the stem , and then slice them
and finally cut them into cubes . The vegetables are ready for cooking: in a pan, heat the olive oil , add the sliced onions, and let them stew over moderate heat for 5-6 minutes or until soft .
At this point, add the peppers and after a minute, add the tomatoes . Salt to taste , and pepper
cover with a lid and cook for about 15-20 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally. The timing also depends on how you cut the vegetables; you should cook until the dish is creamy . Once ready, serve your bandiera hot accompanied by crispy toasted bread!
Store the bandiera in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. We do not recommend freezing.
We recommend using ripe tomatoes; if you do not like the skin, you can peel them easily after blanching the tomatoes for a few minutes. Alternatively, you can use peeled tomatoes, and to add an aromatic touch to the dish, add a few basil leaves at the end of preparation: it will pleasantly perfume the dish!
