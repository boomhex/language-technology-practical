instructions:
Put water in a pot to boil, add salt and then cook the pasta.
In the meantime make the lemon butter sauce: heat the olive oil in a pan over medium-low heat, add the butter and wait for it to melt.
Stir in minced garlic and chopped fresh chilli and cook for 1 minute until the garlic changes color (be careful not to burn it).
Add lemon juice, zest and mix again.
Cook spaghetti “al dente” following times indicated on the package, drain (reserve 1/2 cup of water) and transfer directly to the pan with the sauce.
Add Parmesan, chopped parsley, ½ cup pasta cooking water and mix well until the sauce becomes smooth and creamy.
Season with salt.
Serve immediately with addition of Parmesan, chopped parsley and lemon zest if desired.
Lemon butter pasta can be kept in the fridge for a maximum of 3 days in an airtight container. When you decide to consume it, heat it in the microwave or if you prefer on the stove over medium-low heat, adding 2 tablespoons of water if the sauce is too thick.
PASTA: we chose spaghetti but any long pasta such as linguine or fettuccine is indicated. If you replace with fresh egg pasta, cooking is faster.
BUTTER : it is one of the main ingredient: choose high quality unsalted butter.
LEMONS : This recipe uses both lemon juice and zest so we recommend using organic lemons.
CHILI PEPPER : it is certainly useful to give more flavor but avoid if there are children.
