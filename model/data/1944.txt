To prepare the vegetarian toast, first deal with the vegetables. Wash the eggplant, trim it, and cut it into slices about 0.4 inches thick with a mandoline or a knife . Repeat the same operation for the zucchini . At this point, place the slices on a hot grill slightly greased and cook them on high heat, turning them after a couple of minutes .
Let the other side cook as well and place them in a container . Season the zucchini with salt and pepper and grill the eggplants ; even in this case, it will take about 5 minutes of cooking. Salt and pepper these too, then move on to preparing the cherry tomato cream.
Place the well-washed and dried cherry tomatoes in the glass of a mixer, add the basil leaves , ricotta, oil , salt, and pepper .
Blend everything until you get a cream and set aside . Wash and slice the tomato as well . Start assembling the vegetarian toast. First, butter a slice of bread , then flip it over; the buttered side will indeed be the one that should come into contact with the pan.
Create a layer of cherry tomato cream , lay down a couple of grilled eggplants and a couple of tomato slices .
Also place a slice of Emmental cheese and cover with another slice of bread. Add another layer of cream ;
then place the zucchini and another slice of cheese . Close with another slice of bread and butter it .
Place in an already hot pan , cover with the lid and let it cook for about 5 minutes, pressing it from time to time with a spatula to help the cheese melt .
When it is well browned, flip it and finish cooking for another 3 minutes, pressing it from time to time . As soon as the other side is also well browned, transfer it to a cutting board, cut it in half , and enjoy your steaming toast !
We recommend consuming the vegetarian toast immediately. If you prefer, you can prepare both the grilled vegetables and the cherry tomato cream a bit in advance and store them in the refrigerator.
If you prefer, instead of the cherry tomato cream, you can use a mayonnaise flavored with a few drops of Tabasco, or the pesto you love the most!
