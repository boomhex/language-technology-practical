The Gin and Tonic is a very simple cocktail to prepare. It's a "build up," meaning it's made simply by pouring the ingredients into the glass: gin and tonic water. It's a popular choice as an aperitif or after dinner drink, and there's a true cult following for gin, as each gin is a world of its own (spicy, floral, with a strong juniper flavor...). We'll show you how to make this cocktail created in 18th-century England, served in the classic highball glass, flavored with lemon and juniper berries. Its fresh taste, with the aromatic hint provided by the berries and the citrus notes of the lemon (or orange if preferred), makes it a very pleasant drink to sip, especially for a summer aperitif.
