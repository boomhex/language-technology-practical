instructions:
To prepare yellow risotto with chanterelles, wash the mushrooms under running water , dry them with a cloth, and halve the larger ones . Stew the chanterelles in a pan with 3 tablespoons of butter for a few minutes and lightly salt them.
In a large pot, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter and sauté the finely chopped onion until golden . Add the rice and toast it for a few minutes, stirring to prevent sticking . During cooking, deglaze the rice with broth, adding a ladleful from time to time .
After 10 minutes, add the saffron and continue cooking by adding more broth and stirring . When almost done, add the cooked mushrooms and adjust the salt if necessary. Finish with a sprinkle of pepper and, with the heat off, add the grated parmesan and stir until creamy. Serve the yellow risotto with chanterelles hot.
Yellow risotto with chanterelles is excellent when freshly made, but if there's any leftover, you can keep it in the fridge, covered, for a couple of days and reheat it with a pat of butter.
You can replace the chanterelles with any type of mushrooms you prefer.
For proper selection, treatment, and storage of mushrooms, please refer to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
