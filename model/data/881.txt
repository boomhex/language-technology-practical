instructions:
To prepare the bunny cookies, first make the dough. Pour the flour onto the work surface creating the classic fountain shape, then add the zest of one lemon , powdered sugar , and cubed butter .
Add the egg and start mixing with a dough scraper and then with your hands .
You shouldn't work the dough too much; as soon as it is homogeneous , wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Then form 30 balls with aluminum foil, the same size as your chocolate eggs .
Roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface and cut out the cookies using a gingerbread man-shaped cutter ; with these quantities, you will get about 20. Place them upside down, with the head facing down, and place the ball in the center . Raise the arms to "hug" the ball, without pressing too hard.
Slightly shape the man's legs to make them pointed so they look like ears . Transfer to a baking tray and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 15 minutes. Remove them from the oven and, while they are still warm, carefully remove the aluminum ball. Let them cool completely, then place the chocolate egg in the center .
Now prepare the glaze: in a small bowl, pour powdered sugar and water , mix with a whisk and add pink food coloring .
Mix again until you obtain a fluid and evenly colored glaze . Transfer it to a piping bag and decorate the edges of the bunnies . Let the glaze solidify for an hour and serve your bunny cookies !
The bunny cookies can be stored under a glass dome for 3-4 days.
If you prefer, you can place the formed bunnies in the fridge before baking: this way, the little paws won't risk detaching from the aluminum foil eggs during baking.
