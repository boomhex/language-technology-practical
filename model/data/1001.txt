instructions:
To make the broccoli and sausage bundt cake, first clean the broccoli by removing the leaves and breaking the florets off the stem , then rinse them under running water and blanch them in salted water for about 3 minutes . Drain them and set aside .
Remove the casing from the sausages and mash them with a fork , then add a drizzle of oil and a clove of garlic to a pan , add the sausage and cook for about 3 minutes .
When the sausage is well browned add the broccoli , place them in the pan with the sausage, let them season for 5 minutes, remove the clove of garlic , take off the heat and let cool.
In a bowl, crack the eggs, add the salt and mix. Pour in the oil and the milk and mix again.
Add the well-drained ricotta , then add the grated cheese , mix and incorporate the flour in multiple additions .
Finally, incorporate the instant yeast . Mix again . Add 3/4 of the sausage and broccoli mixture to the batter .
Gently fold them into the batter and pour it into a greased and floured 8-inch bundt pan . Level the surface with a spatula .
Add the leftover filling on top , bake at 350°F in a preheated static oven, for about 35/40 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to a rack to cool, then serve the broccoli and sausage bundt cake.
The broccoli and sausage bundt cake can be stored at room temperature for a couple of days. You can freeze it after cooking, maybe already portioned.
By doubling the quantities, you can use a 9.5-10-inch bundt pan.
If you don't have ricotta or can't use it, you can replace it with another fresh and soft cheese like goat cheese or mascarpone. Some users have omitted the ricotta and used Galbanino. Having not tried it ourselves, we can't provide precise instructions on the outcome or the amounts to use, but it's worth a try!
