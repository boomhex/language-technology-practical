So here's the deal: the torta caprese di sfoglia is something special. Seriously good stuff. It mixes those classic Caprese flavors in a fresh, exciting way. And listen, instead of the usual salad, this savory pie gives you layers of tender confit cherry tomatoes and whole mozzarella knots . They look as good as they taste. I mean, the pastry gets crispy and golden in the oven—soaks up all the tomato juices, yet keeps its shape perfectly.
In Campania, folks really love how this recipe takes simple, fresh ingredients like mozzarella and tomatoes and gives them a rustic twist. Which is great. Everything gets topped with plenty of oregano and basil—bringing that extra kick of fragrance you find in so many southern Italian dishes. It's colorful, with sweet and herby notes, making it really really good. A change from the usual pizza or salad.
Bring this mozzarella cheese pie to a picnic or for a casual dinner, and it'll vanish fast. No question. Few Italian snacks pack so much flavor with just a few basic ingredients. Plus, the confit tomatoes turn all jammy and moist from slow roasting, while the mozzarella stays soft and stretchy on top. Pretty simple, huh?
Unlike some tomato pies from other regions, the Campania version keeps it simple—no heavy sauces or extra fillings. Just the good stuff. Some folks even swap in different herbs or add a drizzle of basil pesto for a twist. And look, the way the pastry stays flaky under all those toppings is kind of amazing.
This Italian savory tart is perfect for brunch, lunch, or just a laid-back hangout with friends. For real. Whether you serve it warm or at room temperature, the combo of tangy tomatoes, tender cheese, and herby aroma makes every bite feel special. It's a smart way to enjoy Caprese flavors in a fun, shareable form that shows off the best of Campania’s cooking. Enjoy it with a glass of wine, and you've got a meal that’s both simple and satisfying, showing just how amazing Italian food can be.
To prepare the caprese puff pastry pie, first take the puff pastry roll and gently lay it out on a surface . Then transfer it inside a 10-inch fluted pan and make sure the pastry adheres well to all the edges .
In a small bowl, beat an egg and use it to brush over the entire surface of the pastry . Prick the base with a fork
and sprinkle the base with grated Grana cheese . Bake in a static oven preheated to 350°F for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, as the pastry is in the oven, take care of the confit cherry tomatoes. First, wash and dry them. Place them on a cutting board and cut them in half . Arrange them gradually on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, with the cut side facing up
and season them with oil , salt , lemon zest ,
oregano , and finally powdered sugar , sprinkled with a sieve. When the pastry is golden brown, remove it from the oven and let it cool. Raise the oven temperature to 425°F and bake the cherry tomatoes for 30 minutes.
Then, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly . Transfer the pastry to a cutting board, place the cherry tomatoes inside , add the knots on top and decorate with basil leaves . Your caprese puff pastry is ready to be enjoyed.
We recommend consuming the caprese puff pastry immediately. Alternatively, it can be stored in the fridge for two days.
Add pitted black olives to contrast the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes.
