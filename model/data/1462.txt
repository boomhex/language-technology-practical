instructions:
To prepare vegan meringues, first filter the chickpea cooking water (aquafaba), then pour it into the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment . Add a few drops of lemon juice and start the mixer at medium speed until a white and frothy mixture is obtained .
At this point, gradually add the powdered sugar, keeping the whisk running . Continue whipping until the mixture is firm: it should form a pointed tip at the end of the whisk . Transfer the obtained mixture into a piping bag with a star nozzle .
Form the meringues on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper : we made about 20 meringues with a diameter of 2.5-3 inches. Bake in a preheated static oven at 212°F for at least 3 hours, placing the baking sheet on the middle rack. Once baked, let your vegan meringues cool completely before serving or using them for your recipes !
Vegan meringues can be stored for about 2 weeks, inside a tin box and protected from humidity.
After forming the meringues, you can garnish them with cocoa or chocolate flakes just before baking!
