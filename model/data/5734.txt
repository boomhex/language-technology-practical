instructions:
Once upon a time, there was a humble pumpkin. It came from a country garden but dreamed of becoming elegant and graceful—like Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina . With the help of its dear friends— leeks , a pinch of nutmeg , and a swirl of cream —its transformation was complete. From a clumsy autumn vegetable, it became a refined, velvety pumpkin soup , full of charm and flavor. But deep down, it stayed the same at heart... even if the cream did go a little to its head!
We love happy endings in the kitchen—and we’re sure this pumpkin soup will win you over too. Delicate, comforting, and rich in autumnal aroma, it’s one of the most beloved fall recipes , perfect for warming both heart and palate on chilly evenings. With its smooth texture and slightly French flair, this dish is just as suitable for a cozy family dinner as it is for an elegant holiday table.
And while it’s already ideal for Halloween , with just a few small tweaks, it can also become a standout Thanksgiving starter —a seasonal, comforting dish that opens the meal with warmth and style.

To make the pumpkin soup, first, clean the pumpkin and cut 2.2 lbs of flesh into cubes , then slice the leeks into rounds .
Heat the oil in a large pot, add the leeks and sauté for a few minutes over medium-low heat , stirring to prevent them from burning . If necessary, you can add a ladle of hot broth .
Once the leeks are well sautéed, add the pumpkin and stir for a few minutes to flavor it, then cover with the hot broth . Cook the pumpkin, stirring often, it will take about 25-30 minutes .
When the pumpkin is very soft and almost disintegrated, adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, then flavor with nutmeg . At this point, add almost all the cream , keeping a little aside for the final decoration.
Blend with an immersion blender until smooth ; it should be smooth and velvety . Roughly chop the hazelnuts with a knife .
Pour the hazelnuts into a pan along with the rosemary and a drizzle of oil and toast for a few minutes .
Garnish the dishes with the cream set aside , stir lightly and complete with the toasted hazelnuts and a few sprigs of rosemary: your pumpkin soup is ready to be served !
The pumpkin soup can be stored in the refrigerator covered for 2-3 days.
You can freeze it for a month.
As an alternative to the Delica variety, you can use butternut squash or muscat pumpkin; Neapolitan pumpkin is not suitable because it is too watery.
If the consistency of the soup is too liquid, you can add a boiled mashed potato.
For a lighter and spicier soup, you can replace the cream with yogurt. Additionally, you can flavor it with a pinch of curry and chives.
Serve the pumpkin soup with handmade croutons, perhaps prepared with the gluten-free pizza dough recipe, to please everyone!
