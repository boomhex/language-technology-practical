instructions:
The orange and chocolate cake is a dessert that encompasses the perfect encounter between two flavors creating a unique and irresistible harmony. The preparation is slightly different from the classic orange cake : in this case, grated peel, candied orange , and fresh juice are worked together to form a concentrate of aromas and flavors that give the cake a unique character, an intoxicating smell that will envelop you from the first moment the cake starts to bake. Once the batter is prepared, chocolate chips are added, which distribute in the batter and melt slightly during baking. The contrast between the freshness of the orange and the depth of the chocolate is what makes this cake truly special. A perfect balance between the rich and enveloping taste of chocolate and the lively citrus note of orange, a play of contrasts that delights the palate.

To prepare the orange and chocolate cake, first grate the orange peel , then with the help of a juicer, extract the juice and pour it over the grated peel .
In a blender, place the candied orange , add the freshly prepared juice , and blend until you obtain a semi-liquid concentrated paste . For convenience, you can use cubed candied orange.
In a bowl, crack the eggs, add the sugar and beat with an electric mixer for a few minutes . Continue beating with the mixer and gradually add the flour and baking powder , previously sifted, alternating with the vegetable oil .
Then add the orange paste and mix for a few more minutes until well incorporated. Quickly chop the chocolate chips in the blender and add them to the batter . Mix with a spatula .
Pour everything into a 9-inch springform pan, previously buttered and floured . Bake in a static oven, preheated to 340°F (170°C) for 45 minutes. Use a toothpick to check for doneness. Let it cool completely , unmold, and finish with powdered sugar . The orange and chocolate cake is ready to be served.
If consumed within 2-3 days, the orange and chocolate cake can be stored in a cake holder at room temperature. If you prefer longer storage, you can place the cake in the refrigerator in a closed container, where it will stay fresh for 4-5 days. To store it for a longer period, you can freeze it. Slice it and wrap each piece individually with plastic wrap, then place them in a freezer bag or airtight container. The frozen cake will keep well for up to 2 months.
If you love the intense flavor of chocolate, you can replace the chocolate chips with high-quality dark chocolate pieces. This will make the cake richer and with an even more pronounced contrast between the sweetness of the orange and the bitterness of the chocolate. You can incorporate chopped almonds into the batter, which pair perfectly with the taste of orange and chocolate, giving the cake an interesting texture and a more complex flavor.
