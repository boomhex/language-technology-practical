instructions:
To make the King's Risotto, first, place the saffron threads in a small bowl, cover with cold water, and let them soak for 2 hours. In the meantime, prepare the chicken broth and keep it warm. Finely chop the red onion and sauté it in a large saucepan with a generous splash of olive oil , then add the rice .
Toast the rice for a few minutes, stirring continuously . When the grains feel warm to the touch, deglaze with the white wine and let the alcohol completely evaporate. At this point, start adding the chicken broth, one ladle at a time, always waiting for the previous one to be absorbed .
Salt and continue cooking for about 3 minutes, then add the saffron and mix well .
After a couple of minutes, add the gorgonzola and stir to melt it completely. Also, add the truffle cream and mix well . Continue cooking the rice for another 3-4 minutes.
When the risotto is ready, remove it from the heat and cream it with cold cubed butter from the freezer , cubed gorgonzola , and grated Grana Padano DOP .
Also drizzle with a splash of olive oil and mix well. Finally, grate black truffle directly onto the dish . Your King's Risotto is ready to be served !
It is advisable to consume the King's Risotto immediately.
It is preferable to use a sweet gorgonzola, not spicy.
If the broth used to cook the rice is salty enough, there is no need to add more salt.
