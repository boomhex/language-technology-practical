instructions:
To prepare your Parisian-style gnocchi, start with the dough. You will need to make choux pastry, so place the milk and butter in a saucepan and heat over medium heat. When it begins to simmer, add the flour .
Stir with a spoon until the mixture is smooth and well detached from the sides . Turn off the heat and add the Parmesan , continuing to stir until fully absorbed .
Now transfer the dough to a stand mixer with a paddle attachment and set it to medium speed. Add one egg at a time , making sure to wait until the previous one is completely absorbed before continuing. Once the eggs are mixed in, add the nutmeg .
Salt and give it a final stir . With the help of a spatula, place the dough in a piping bag with a plain 16 mm nozzle . Let the dough cool in the refrigerator.
In the meantime, prepare the sauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the flour . Stir with a whisk on low heat for a few minutes. Gradually add the milk , continuing to stir with the whisk to avoid lumps. Once all the milk is added, increase the heat to medium and stir until it thickens (like béchamel).
When the mixture has thickened, turn off the heat and add the grated cheeses , salt, and pepper . Mix well to melt the cheeses.
By now, the dough will have cooled. Bring a pot of water to a boil and salt it. Position yourself with the piping bag above the pot and squeeze with one hand; when about 1 1/4 inches of dough comes out, cut it with a knife letting it fall into the water . This way, you will form your gnocchi. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then drain them onto a tray with the help of a slotted spoon . You will get about 21 oz of cooked gnocchi.
Take small pans or small baking dishes (if round, 7 inches in diameter, if rectangular, 8x5.5 inches) and spread 2 tablespoons of sauce on the bottom . Place the gnocchi on top and cover with another 2 tablespoons of sauce .
Sprinkle with grated Parmesan . Add small knobs of butter on top and put to gratinate in a preheated oven, for 10 minutes on the top shelf in grill mode at 464°F. Once out of the oven, the Parisian-style gnocchi will be ready to be served .
Parisian-style gnocchi can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. You can prepare the baking dishes in advance and store them in the fridge to gratinate just before serving.
You can replace the Gruyere with another soft cheese like a local Toma cheese.
