Pizza dolce alla frutta is, I gotta say, a super fun twist on the classic Italian pizza. It's from the beautiful Campania region, you know? Instead of the usual tomato sauce and cheese, you get a fruit pizza with this deliciously moist pan brioche base, lightly scented with orange. Really, the folks in Campania love taking their traditional pizza dough and making something sweet and unexpected—pretty cool, right?
The magic happens when you top it with colorful, fresh fruit like strawberries, kiwi, or juicy peaches. Honestly, it looks like a fruit tart , but it's got a softer, more tender texture thanks to that unique bread base. Add some dark melted chocolate on top, and you've got something decadent. Perfect for summer parties or whenever you're craving a colorful dessert that’s a bit different.
Families and friends are thrilled by this dessert. And look, adults love its elegance compared to your standard sugar cookie fruit pizza you'd find at an American picnic. Mixing the Campania bread base with sweet, juicy fruit creates a refreshing treat. Each slice tastes different based on the fruit you pick. It's so colorful and inviting.
Here's the deal, it’s one of those easy fruit pizza ideas that finishes any meal with flair. Plus, you can give it a homemade fruit pizza touch—add some citrus zest or maybe some cream. Keep it simple or add your twist; the golden base and those colorful toppings make it a summer dessert that's light and creative. Great for sharing.
And here's the thing: nobody expects pizza for dessert, but once they try it, they’re hooked! With its unique mix of flavors and textures, this fruit pizza stands out as a refreshing, fun way to enjoy pizza in a sweet new way. Really, who knew pizza could be so amazing?
To prepare the sweet fruit pizza, start with the base: divide the portion of warm milk into 2 small bowls: in one, add to half of the milk the honey and the yeast (alternatively, you can use 0.2 oz of fresh yeast) , stirring to dissolve them with a teaspoon .
In the other small bowl with the other half portion of warm milk, add the salt and dissolve it by stirring with a teaspoon . In a large bowl, pour the sifted flour and grate the orange zest .
Then pour the two liquids into the bowl with the flour and grated orange zest: first add the milk in which you dissolved the honey and yeast , then briefly mix with a fork and also pour the milk in which you dissolved the salt .
Add the oil and start working the mixture by hand . When the liquids have been absorbed, transfer the dough to a floured work surface or board .
Knead vigorously with your hands to obtain a smooth and soft dough with which you will form a ball . Place it in a bowl covered with plastic wrap and let it rise for at least 3 hours at room temperature .
After the necessary time, the dough will have increased in volume . Then place it on a floured surface and roll it out with a rolling pin to obtain a disc of pan brioche 0.4 inch thick and 13 inches in diameter. Take a 13-inch diameter pan and line it with parchment paper. Lay the pan brioche disc in the pan with the help of the rolling pin .
Make sure to perfectly adhere the base and edges to the mold . Then prick the base with the prongs of a fork and bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 30 minutes (if using a fan oven at 320°F for 20-25 minutes). When it is cooked, take it out of the oven and let it cool slightly .
Meanwhile, start preparing the fruit to top the pizza: wash each fruit well, cut the apricots in half, remove the pit, and slice them into wedges . Also, cut the peach in half and dice it into small cubes; then proceed with the strawberries, removing the leaves and cutting them in half . Then peel the kiwi, cut it in half, and slice it widthwise . Finally, wash the cherries and blueberries that will also be used to top the pizza.
Now carefully brush the entire base of the sweet pizza with 3.5 oz of currant jam that you have slightly heated beforehand to make it more liquid. Then add the fruit evenly onto the pizza, starting with the apricot wedges , then the peach cubes and strawberries .
Finish with the blueberries and whole cherries . Mix the remaining jam with 1.8 oz of room temperature water and brush the fruit; this step will preserve the fruit better and give a glossy effect . Then finish garnishing with a few mint leaves. Your sweet fruit pizza will be ready to brighten your table ! Store it in the fridge and take it out 15 minutes before serving.
The sweet fruit pizza can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days covered with plastic wrap. Take it out of the fridge 15 minutes before consuming. Freezing is not recommended.
We know some of you live solely on pizzas and focaccias: this recipe is for you, indefatigable carbohydrate lovers :) Fruit and jam: your preferences. Rather, how about flavoring the pan brioche base with orange, lemon, or vanilla? Or serving the pizza accompanied by cream, fruit ice cream, or a fresh Chantilly cream?
