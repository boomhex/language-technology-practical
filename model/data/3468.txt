To prepare the maltagliati with spinach and salted ricotta, start by making the fresh pasta. Sift the flour into a bowl , transfer it to a pastry board, form a well and add the re-milled semolina, make a hole in the center and widen it slightly. Pour an egg into the center and begin to mix the flour with the egg using a fork . Add the other eggs little by little, continuing to knead .
Once you have obtained a compact dough, continue to work it vigorously by hand, pressing it with the palm of your hand , then give it a spherical shape and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature inside a plastic bag . After resting, divide the dough into 3 parts; while you roll out one, keep the others in the bag to prevent them from drying out. Roll each piece with the rolling pin , dusting with re-milled semolina as needed, to form a thin rectangle; you should achieve a thickness of about 1/16 inch so that when lifting the dough you can see the shadow of the palm underneath. You can also roll it out with a pasta machine set to the narrowest measure, dusting with re-milled semolina as needed. As you roll out the sheets, lay them on a floured pastry board, cover them with a clean cotton cloth, and continue rolling out the other pieces, stacking them one on top of the other once ready, separated by a dry tea towel.
Cut each sheet into horizontal strips 1.25 inches wide . Then cut them again into diagonal strips 0.8 inches . Place the prepared maltagliati on a lightly floured dry tea towel, waiting to be cooked.
To prepare the maltagliati with spinach and salted ricotta, start by pouring the oil into a pan, add the chopped shallot and let it soften over low heat; then add the bacon and let it brown gently . Add the cleaned spinach and cover with a lid so that they cook quickly ; once cooked, salt them.
Cook the maltagliati in plenty of salted water and when they are cooked and al dente, drain them and add them to the pan with a little cooking water : toss, then pepper and plate. Finally, sprinkle the dishes with grated salted ricotta .
