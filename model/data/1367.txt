instructions:
To make the puccia, first wash and dry the zucchini, then cut them in half and slice them into slices a few millimeters thick . Season them with oil and salt and mix. Heat a grill and when it is hot, place the zucchini .
Grill them for 2-3 minutes on each side and set them aside. Now clean the zucchini flowers: after brushing them with a kitchen brush to remove any residues, remove the bud and internal pistils, then cut them in half . Prepare the batter: pour the flour and water into a bowl , mix to combine.
Salt the batter and meanwhile heat the oil for frying. Bring the seed oil to 338-356°F (check the temperature with a kitchen thermometer), then dip a few flowers at a time into the batter to coat them irregularly. Then, dip them into the oil and fry them until they are crispy and slightly golden. It will take about a minute.
