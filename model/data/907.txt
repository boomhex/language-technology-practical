instructions:
To prepare the bull's eye tart, start with the Shortcrust pastry . You can work with the mixer or by hand in the same order. So, pour the flour and the cold butter pieces into the bowl . Mix the ingredients with the paddle attachment for a couple of minutes before adding the powdered sugar and the salt .
Mix the ingredients again to get a crumbly dough. Add the whole eggs and the yolks . Let the mixer work for a few more moments until it becomes homogeneous . Transfer to a surface, work quickly to compact, then form a loaf, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour .
After the resting time, roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1/5 inch . Using a pastry ring, cut out two discs 8.5 inches in diameter and transfer the shapes onto two baking sheets lined with parchment paper .
On one of the two bases, make a hole with a smaller pastry cutter of 4 inches in diameter and remove the pastry from the center but not the ring which will help keep the shape . Proceed with baking the two discs in a static oven at 356°F for 15 minutes; remove the forms when the discs have cooled .
Do the same with the other disc . When the bases are completely cool, proceed with the composition . On the closed disc, pour the Apricot Jam to spread with a spoon or a piping bag .
Place the second holed disc and press slightly with your fingers to adhere well . Decorate the surface with plenty of powdered sugar, without worrying if it falls onto the jam because it will be absorbed, and your bull's eye tart is ready .
The bull's eye tart keeps for 3 days at room temperature.
The shortcrust pastry can be prepared well in advance and stored in the refrigerator.
Choose the jam you love most to make the bull's eye tart or, alternatively, pastry cream, or hazelnut, pistachio... follow your taste! With leftover pastry, you can make standard-sized bull's eyes.
