instructions:
To prepare the baked ruoto with kid goat, start by pouring water and vinegar into a large bowl , in a 3:1 ratio. Immerse the cleaned kid goat pieces here . Ten minutes will suffice (or longer if you prefer), in this way the strong taste will be softened. Meanwhile, wash the potatoes and cut them into cubes of about 1 inch .
Clean the onion and slice it not too thinly . Chop the peeled tomatoes . Drain the kid goat well and place the pieces on a large baking dish .
Add the diced potatoes, peas , peeled tomatoes, and onion . Season with oil, salt , and pepper to taste.
Add enough water to almost cover the ingredients and mix . Then cook in a preheated static oven at 356°F for about 1 hour. Stir well halfway through cooking. Once ready , serve the baked ruoto with kid goat piping hot!
The baked ruoto with kid goat can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days. You can freeze it after cooking if you used fresh ingredients.
In addition to the Easter variant with kid goat, there is one with lamb or with beef or chicken. In some families, the use of fresh cherry tomatoes, as an alternative to peeled tomatoes, is passed down. Although the ruoto in the strict sense represents a circular mold, it does not necessarily imply the use of a round mold. "Ruoto" generally refers to a baking tray for oven cooking.
