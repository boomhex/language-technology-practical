instructions:
To make the salmon and mushroom pasta, first clean the mushrooms by removing the earthy parts and wiping them all over with a damp cloth . Cut off the base of the stem and slice them not too thinly .
Crush the garlic clove and split it in half , then set it aside. Peel and slice the onion, wash and chop the parsley . Take the fresh salmon fillet and remove the skin .
Remove any bones with kitchen tweezers and cut it into cubes of roughly the same size . Pour a drizzle of olive oil into a pan and sauté the onion and half a clove of garlic for 2 minutes.
Remove the garlic and add the mushrooms and a pinch of salt . Cook over medium heat for 5-6 minutes, stirring often. Once ready, set the mushrooms aside . Meanwhile, place a pot full of water on the stove, bring it to a boil, and then salt it for cooking the pasta.
In the same pan, add another drizzle of oil and the other half of the garlic clove , let it flavor for a minute, then remove the garlic from the pan and add the salmon and a pinch of white pepper . Cook for 3-4 minutes over medium heat, stirring it often.
Add the previously sautéed mushrooms , the chopped parsley , deglaze with dry white wine and let it evaporate completely .
Add the fresh cream and let the sauce thicken, cooking over medium heat for 2-3 minutes . Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pot and drain it 1 minute before the time indicated on the package.
Drain the pasta directly into the pan with the sauce , mix for a moment to flavor , and serve the salmon and mushroom pasta very hot .
We recommend consuming the salmon and mushroom pasta immediately.
If the mushrooms are very dirty, you can quickly rinse them under running water and then dry them with a cloth.
