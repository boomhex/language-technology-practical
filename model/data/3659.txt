To prepare spicy crab linguine, wash the vegetables under plenty of fresh running water and cut the carrot, celery, and onion into rather coarse pieces, setting them aside . Put a pot with slightly salted water on the heat and boil the crab for 5 minutes . When it's ready, drain it with a slotted spoon and let it cool .
Proceed then to clean the crab: with a small knife, remove the tail flap and separate the top part from the bottom. Remove the stomach sac, the soft gills, as they are not edible, and extract the tender and creamy flesh. Open the claws with pliers and remove the meat in large pieces.
Twist the legs one at a time with a firm motion in the opposite direction to which they are oriented to detach them and extract the hidden meat inside . Keep the remnants aside as they will be useful. In a pan, melt the butter and add the oil . Add the roughly chopped vegetables and sauté for 5 minutes. Add the crab remnants ,
deglaze with the brandy and cook for 25-30 minutes over low heat, adding the room temperature water . Let it cook until reduced to concentrate the flavor best .
Once ready, strain everything with the help of a fine-mesh sieve and set aside . Cut the chili in half and remove the internal seeds .
Finely chop it , then wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them into 4 parts . Sauté a clove of garlic in a non-stick pan with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil ;
remove the garlic and add the chili and cherry tomatoes , season with salt and pepper and add thyme, cooking for 10 minutes . Add the crab meat to the pan
along with the broth you prepared earlier , stir with a spatula and turn off the heat. Put a pot with water on the heat, when it reaches a boil, cook the linguine for 8 minutes, leaving it al dente . Once ready, drain the pasta and add it directly to the pan with the sauce ;
turn on the heat, add the fish stock you prepared , distributing it evenly . Toss for a few moments to flavor, finally serve your spicy crab linguine piping hot, garnishing them with some thyme leaves .
It is recommended to consume spicy crab linguine immediately while hot.
A useful tip for cooking crab: estimate about 5 minutes of cooking for every 1 lb of weight.
