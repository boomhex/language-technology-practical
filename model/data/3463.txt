To prepare the hazelnut mousse and heart with 5 hops, start by preparing the beer jelly heart: soak the gelatin sheets in cold water for 10 minutes, meanwhile, in a small pot, bring the Bock Rossa with 5 hops from the Birrificio Angelo Poretti to a boil and reduce it by one-third . Then add the brown sugar and the well-squeezed gelatin sheets and let them dissolve. Pour the obtained mixture into small containers about 1.18 inches in diameter (alternatively, you can use ice cube trays) and let it solidify in the fridge for at least 2 hours.
Now prepare the English cream: in a saucepan, bring the milk to a boil with the vanilla pod infusing, add it to the egg yolks beaten with sugar , mix well, and cook in a double boiler until the cream reaches 180°F. Then strain the cream to remove any lumps and when it is lukewarm, add it to the hazelnuts that you have blended with a teaspoon of sugar until reduced to a very fine powder . Dissolve in it the gelatin previously soaked in cold water and squeezed, and add the glossy whipped cream, incorporating it gently so as not to deflate it .
Then pour the mixture into semi-spherical molds about 2.36 inches in diameter, filling them halfway. Then place the set jelly inside and cover with more mousse, filling the molds. Let it rest in the fridge for another 4 hours. Melt ¾ of the milk chocolate bar in the microwave and add the remaining finely chopped, mixing it until it melts ; then add the puffed rice and mix everything .
Distribute the mixture with a spoon between two sheets of parchment paper, spread it well, and level it with a rolling pin , then let it set in the refrigerator for about half an hour; then use a round pastry cutter to obtain circular shapes the same size as the mousse , you will get chocolate and puffed rice circles that will garnish the mousse . At this point, you can assemble the hazelnut mousse and heart with 5 hops by placing the chocolate and puffed rice circle in the center of the plate, then unmold the mousse on top of it and decorate with mixed berries and chopped hazelnuts!
