instructions:
To prepare the mini omelettes with black cabbage, first remove the stems from the black cabbage and rinse the leaves under running water, leaving them whole. Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan, add the black cabbage leaves , and sauté them for about 5 minutes over high heat until they soften . Set the black cabbage aside and prepare the egg mixture: pour the eggs into a bowl and add the milk ,
the grated Parmesan , salt , and pepper, then mix everything with a whisk or a fork . Transfer the mixture into a pitcher to fill the molds more easily.
Butter a muffin tin and line it with breadcrumbs, then evenly distribute the egg mixture inside the mold and place a cabbage leaf in each compartment .
Add a grind of pepper on top and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 20 minutes . Once out of the oven, let your mini omelettes with black cabbage cool slightly before unmolding and serving them: they will also be great at room temperature !
The mini omelettes with black cabbage can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can flavor the egg mixture with a teaspoon of turmeric and insert a cube of soft cheese inside the mini omelettes!
