Packed with chocolate flavor that’s not too heavy, these chocolatey delights work well for birthday parties, holidays, or even just a simple family dinner.

Busy families always appreciate a dessert like double meringues with cocoa whipped cream for its simple joy and versatility.

You can change things up for holidays, birthdays, or even just a Sunday treat, and they still look just as nice . For a bit of extra FUN, try serving with a scoop of ice cream or a drizzle of chocolate syrup, especially when families want a little extra indulgence.

Even home bakers who want something reliable find these a good choice, since the flavor always makes guests happy and the cookies stay firm and tasty on the serving tray.

Take the meringues, or prepare the meringues according to the recipe for French meringues on our website and let them cool. In the meantime, whip the very cold fresh cream well, then add the powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Place the mixture in a pastry bag fitted with a wide, serrated nozzle, take a meringue and place some cocoa cream on its base, trying to form a spiral, and place another meringue's base on top of it. Place the dessert thus obtained in a cupcake mold and proceed in this manner with the rest of the meringues. Serve them immediately.
Place the prepared meringues in elegant cupcake molds and serve immediately, or store them in a cool place for a few hours; remember that meringues are sensitive to moisture, so this preparation should be made shortly before being consumed.
