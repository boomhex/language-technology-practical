Once cooked, they will have absorbed some of the water , drain them and rinse under cold running water to stop the cooking and cool them ; transfer them to a large bowl and set aside. Now, deal with the tomatoes: wash them under running water and cut them into small wedges ,
drain the preservation water from the mozzarella balls and dice them . Prepare the arugula by washing it well under water; coarsely chop the arugula leaves . At this point, take the bowl with the grains and add the cherry tomatoes ,
