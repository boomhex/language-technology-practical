Originating from French tradition, it's popular all over, you know, because of its versatility and unique taste. The base? Made from pasta brisée, it’s a tender and flaky foundation that pairs perfectly with the rich fillings. And look, the star here is definitely the Gruyère cheese cream. It adds a creamy and slightly sweet taste—seriously good—beautifully balanced by the slightly bitter radicchio.

The Gruyère cheese provides richness without being too heavy. Plus, the pastry stays golden and a bit crispy on the edges. For those who love experimenting, this savory tart is more exciting than your usual pie or quiche. Its unique balance of flavors makes each bite a new experience.

To prepare the savory tart with Gruyère cream and radicchio, start by making the pastry: put the sifted flour and the cold butter cut into pieces from the refrigerator in a mixer , then turn on the device and blend everything until you get a sandy mixture . Take the water, which should also be cold from the refrigerator, and gradually add it to the butter and flour mixture .
Knead with your hands until you form a compact and elastic dough . Cover the obtained dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 40 minutes (for more information on how to prepare the pastry Easy Shortcrust Pastry ). Meanwhile, prepare the Gruyère cream: heat the milk in a saucepan over low heat
and add the grated nutmeg . In a separate saucepan, melt 2.5 oz of butter , then gradually add the sifted flour . Cook everything for a few minutes, stirring continuously.
Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the hot milk to the roux (flour and butter) , stirring everything with a wooden spoon. Put the saucepan back on the heat and bring slowly to a boil . Add the grated Gruyère and continue cooking over low heat,
until the cream thickens well and the cheese is completely melted, stirring occasionally . Then turn off the heat and set the Gruyère cream aside. In a non-stick pan, melt the remaining butter, add the julienned radicchio, season with salt and pepper , and deglaze with white wine .
Cook everything until all the liquid released by the radicchio is absorbed . When the radicchio is ready, combine it with the Gruyère cream and mix to blend all the ingredients . At this point, line a round ceramic tart pan with a diameter of about 9 inches and a height of about 2.5 inches with previously moistened parchment paper, remove the pastry from the refrigerator, and roll it out into a thin sheet with a rolling pin .
Place the pastry in the tart pan, removing the excess with a knife, then slightly prick it with the prongs of a fork . Add the filling, now lukewarm , and using the leftover dough, cut it into strips with a fluted pastry cutter .
Lay the obtained strips on the dough to form the typical lattice of the tart , then create the top edges by rolling two strips of dough together . Beat an egg yolk with a fork and brush it over the surface of the tart , then bake everything for 40-45 minutes in a preheated static oven at 355°F. Your savory tart with Gruyère cream and radicchio is ready... Enjoy your meal!
You can store the savory tart with Gruyère cream and radicchio in the refrigerator, sealed in an airtight container, for up to 2-3 days.
If you prefer, you can sauté the radicchio with the addition of bacon (sweet or smoked) and/or leek. If you serve the tart while still warm, the consistency will be creamier. If you prefer a firmer consistency, let the tart cool down.
