instructions:
To prepare the taroz, first, boil the potatoes until they are soft; it will take about 30 minutes from when the water starts to boil. Clean the green beans, trim them, and then boil them in water until they are tender, which will take about 10-15 minutes from boiling. Once ready, drain them and quickly plunge them into ice water to keep the color vibrant and stop the cooking.
Cut the young Casera into 1/2 inch cubes and grate the aged cheese. Clean and slice the shallot . In a small pot, add the cubed butter .
Add the shallot , garlic , and sage leaves .
Melt over low heat for 20 minutes . After this time , remove from heat and strain the mixture through a sieve .
You have now obtained the flavored butter . Transfer it to a pan and add the boiled, peeled, whole potatoes .
Mash them with a wooden spoon . Also, add the hand-broken green beans and begin to mix everything to blend, keeping the heat low. At this point, add the young Casera cheese .
Stir and continue cooking until it has completely melted. Pepper .
Salt , and if it becomes too dry, add a little water . Once a thick, creamy puree is obtained, add the grated aged Casera cheese .
Stir one last time to absorb the cheese , then serve the taroz garnishing the plates with edible flowers for a colorful touch .
We recommend consuming the taroz immediately; alternatively, it can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
The flavored butter can be frozen in ice cube trays to have it available as needed.
As an alternative to young Casera, you can use Fontina cheese, while aged Casera can be replaced with Parmigiano Reggiano.
You can mash the potatoes and chop the green beans to make the preparation easier.
This mixture can also be used to fill ravioli.
The flavored butter is also perfect for dressing typical pizzoccheri, fish, or even simple pasta.
Young Casera (or lightly aged) has about 70-90 days of aging: the paste is still soft, the flavor delicate, and the melting ability perfect for warm dishes like taroz.
Aged Casera has over 6 months of aging, with a more intense, aromatic, and slightly spicy flavor.
