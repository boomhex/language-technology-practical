instructions:
To prepare sausage and stracchino crostini, first cut the bread into slices about 3/4 inch thick . Remove the sausage from its casing , transfer it to a bowl, and add the stracchino .
Mix until you obtain a homogeneous mixture . Spread a generous layer of the mixture on the bread .
Place the bread on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake at 392°F for 10-12 minutes or until the sausage is cooked and a golden crust forms on top. Finish with a sprinkle of black pepper . Your sausage and stracchino crostini are ready to be enjoyed .
Sausage and stracchino crostini should be consumed as soon as they are ready, but if there are any leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator in a closed container for up to 1 day. Before serving them again, reheat them in the oven at 356°F for about 10 minutes to restore the bread's crunchiness and melt the stracchino again.
For a more indulgent version, add grated cheese on top for an even more flavorful crust. You can experiment with different types of bread; for example, whole grain bread adds a more intense and rustic flavor. If you love spicy food, you can add chili pepper instead of black pepper.
