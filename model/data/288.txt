So, here's the thing— pumpkin and speck lasagna is like the essence of autumn in Lombardy . You get this sweet roasted pumpkin, really really flavorful, paired with the smoky, savory taste of speck. It is kind of like Italian bacon but even more tender. And you know, what sets this pumpkin lasagna apart is that creamy béchamel sauce, which, let me tell you, gets a serious upgrade from Taleggio cheese—seriously good stuff. This soft cheese just melts in your mouth and hails straight from the northern Italian mountains.
And listen, folks around here love tossing in sage leaves. The moment you catch a whiff, you know something cozy is happening in the oven. It's like a Sunday lunch with family, when everyone wants something hearty and, you know, a bit special.
In northern Italy, people often grab fresh market finds, and speck lasagna with pumpkin is a prime example of mixing local flavors. This isn’t your run-of-the-mill lasagna. Not at all. It's got layers of soft pumpkin that just pair perfectly with the salty speck, and the Taleggio béchamel pulls it all together so everything stays moist and creamy.
Now, some families might switch in pancetta or bacon—really depends—but the speck gives it that true Lombard flavor. Every bite is a mix of golden roasted squash, silky sauce, and those little speck bits that get super super crispy around the edges. People always rave about classic Italian lasagna, but this pumpkin and speck lasagna ? It shows how regional tastes can totally transform a familiar dish.
It's a hearty meal that fits right in with other autumn lasagna recipes. Perfect when the weather turns cool and you want something to warm you up.

To prepare the pumpkin and speck lasagna, start with the egg pasta: pour the flour onto the work surface , form a well, and add the eggs in the center . Season with a pinch of salt .
Break the eggs with a fork and incorporate them into the flour . Work with your hands until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough . Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and set aside.
Move on to the taleggio béchamel: heat the milk in a saucepan and melt the butter in a separate pot . Add the flour to the melted butter all at once and mix quickly with a whisk .
When the roux has formed, pour in the hot milk and blend well with the whisk to avoid lumps . Let the mixture thicken over low heat, stirring continuously, then turn off the heat and add the taleggio in chunks .
Set the béchamel aside, covered with plastic wrap in contact with it . Now heat the oil in a pot, add the sliced onions and the speck cut into strips. Cook over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes .
When the speck is crispy, add the diced pumpkin . Season with salt, chopped sage , and a grind of black pepper . Cook over medium heat for about 10-15 minutes, until the pumpkin is tender.
Take the dough and roll it out first with a rolling pin , then pass it through a pasta machine until you obtain sheets 2 mm thick . Cut the sheets to obtain rectangles the same size as the baking dish ; we used a dish measuring 10x7.5 inches.
Boil the pasta rectangles for about 2 minutes in boiling water , then drain them into a bowl with ice water to stop the cooking . Finally, place the sheets on a tea towel .
You are ready to assemble the lasagna: spread a light layer of béchamel on the bottom of a baking dish , then place the first pasta rectangle . Cover with more béchamel and distribute the pumpkin and speck mixture .
Sprinkle with grated Parmigiano Reggiano and start again with another layer of pasta , continuing this way until all the ingredients are used . You should have a total of 5 layers.
Finish with plenty of grated cheese and bake the lasagna in a static oven at 350°F for about 30-35 minutes or until the surface is nicely golden . Remove from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving your pumpkin and speck lasagna !
Pumpkin and speck lasagna can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days in an airtight container.
You can freeze them once cooked and completely cooled.
If you prefer, you can substitute taleggio with fontina or a semi-aged toma cheese.
