Try these cutlet variations too:

To make grandma's Milanese cutlet, place the veal chop on a cutting board , cover with a sheet of parchment paper, and gently pound it with a meat tenderizer until you reach the desired thickness .
In a bowl, season the eggs with salt and whisk them with a whisk . Pour the beaten eggs into a tray large enough to hold the meat . Spread the breadcrumbs in a second tray.
Dip the meat first in the eggs and then in the breadcrumbs , coating both sides well. Melt the clarified butter in a large pan .
Place the chop and fry it until it is beautifully golden on both sides, turning it with kitchen tongs ; the cooking time depends on the thickness of the meat. Salt to taste and serve your grandma's Milanese cutlet immediately with a side of French fries !
It is recommended to bread and cook grandma's Milanese cutlet at the moment of serving.
