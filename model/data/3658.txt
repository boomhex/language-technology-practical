Special dinners (birthdays, anniversaries, celebrations) often revolve around this pink peppercorn steak since the plate always looks special and the flavors feel like a treat. Kids and grownups get swept up in the combination—the hint of spice, those fancy sea salt crystals, and the wonderful deep beef flavor that’s the signature of a classic beef tenderloin medallion meal.

To make the tournedos with pink pepper and black salt from Hawaii, the first thing to do is to prepare the tournedos: take the pork fillet, remove the fattier outer part with a sharp knife to obtain a fat-free fillet , cut the fillet into slices about 1.2 inches thick
trying to obtain portions of the same thickness to facilitate cooking . Place the slices of lard on a cutting board and wrap them around the medallions (5-6) to cover the entire edge of the medallions.
Once finished , wrap the edge with a kitchen string . Press some pink peppercorns onto the surface of the tournedos .
Start preparing the sauce: put the liquid cream in a saucepan, heat it, and add the tomato paste and the yogurt, which you will mix over low heat . Adjust the salt and let everything thicken, then turn off the heat. In a pan, heat the oil along with the clove of garlic in its skin (i.e., with the skin on) crushed with the back of a kitchen knife,
add the rosemary then add the tournedos . Brown the fillets on both sides, reaching the desired cooking point ; for medium cooking, it will take about 5-6 minutes.
Add the previously prepared sauce to the pan , mix well and let it rest for a minute while keeping everything warm . Sprinkle the black salt from Hawaii over the tournedos and serve the medallions hot .
The recipe is very quick, therefore it is advisable to consume the tournedos with pink pepper and black salt from Hawaii immediately, alternatively, you can prepare the tournedos and freeze them raw, only if you have used fresh pork fillet, to cook them at the moment together with the sauce.
If you can't find or don't like it, you can replace the pink pickled pepper with green pepper. The black salt from Hawaii is also optional, but using it will make your tournedos more refined and scenic. For this recipe, we used pork fillet tournedos, but you can also opt for beef fillet.
