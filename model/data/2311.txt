When the weather in Rome starts cooling down, penne with smoked salmon really becomes a go-to on Roman tables. Honestly, it’s really, really good. This dish—straight from the Lazio region—adds a twist to classic penne pasta recipes by including blanched chicory. You know, cicoria, which is super popular in Roman cooking. The bitter chicory gives it a unique depth that totally matches the rich and almost buttery smoked salmon.
Pretty simple, the ridged penne catches the silky sauce perfectly, so every bite is full of flavor. The thing is, in typical Lazio style, this dish keeps it simple but strong. The moist salmon and the earthy chicory balance each other out, with a touch of fresh chili providing just the right heat. It’s interesting without overpowering everything else.
And here's the thing—a plate of smoked salmon pasta isn't just savory; it’s a true celebration of Roman culinary traditions. The gluten-free penne means everyone can enjoy it. For real, even those with dietary restrictions. Shows how easy pasta recipes can be both tasty and inclusive. Some chefs might switch it up with dandelion greens or add a lemon squeeze for a zesty finish, but the core combo of smoked salmon and chicory ? That's the star.
Plus, this meal is quick to make and fits perfectly into your “quick dinner ideas.” It brings a sense of freshness to the table, just what you need after a chilly day. Not heavy or complicated, but feels like a special treat. Pair it with rustic bread, and you've got an easy dinner that feels like a mini Roman getaway. Whether you're into healthy pasta dishes or just want to shake up your weeknight meals, this Roman-inspired dish is perfect for when you crave big, crispy flavors without all the fuss.
To prepare your penne with smoked salmon and blanched chicory, start by cleaning the chicory: remove the base of the head and, keeping the bunch together, cut the leaves into pieces about 1.2 inches long . Place the cut chicory in a colander and wash it under plenty of running water , then let it drain.
In the meantime, cut open the fresh chili pepper to remove its seeds and stalk and slice the rest into very thin strips . Heat the oil in a pan and sauté the peeled, whole clove of garlic until it sizzles well. At that point, remove it from the sauté and add the chili pepper instead.
Let it brown for a few seconds and add the chicory . Sauté for a minute over high heat, and in the meantime, season with pepper and salt . Then deglaze with white wine and cook through. It will take about ten minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and add the pasta when it boils . While it cooks, take care of the salmon: place the fillet on the cutting board, cut it into thick slices , and dice them .
In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil and, when it's hot, quickly sear the salmon just until it gains color. When it's ready, drain the pasta and transfer it to the pan with the chicory .
Add the seared salmon and toss everything together for a few seconds to combine all the flavors . The penne with smoked salmon and blanched chicory are ready to be enjoyed !
You can store the penne with smoked salmon and blanched chicory in the fridge, covered, for up to 1 day.
If the taste of chicory is too bitter for your palate, replace it with spinach: the dish will be much more delicate, but equally tasty!
