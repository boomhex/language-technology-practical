To prepare the guttiau bread flans with red wine and apples, wash the apples and cut them into wedges , without removing the peel. Remove the stem and core, and cut the wedges in half again to then reduce them to cubes of about 0.6 inches .
Melt the butter in a pan, add the apples and rosemary , season with salt and pepper, and sauté over high heat for about 10 minutes until they are well browned .
Place the gorgonzola in a tall, narrow glass, add the milk and blend with an immersion blender until you get a thick and creamy consistency, similar to béchamel .
At this point, you can assemble the flans: place 4 pastry rings with a diameter of 3 inches on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, then break the guttiau bread into pieces by hand and dip one piece at a time in the red wine so that it softens . Create a first layer of softened guttiau bread inside the pastry rings , add some pieces of apple
and drizzle with a bit of gorgonzola sauce . Add a piece of crunchy guttiau bread and continue with the layers, alternating the softened guttiau bread ,
apples , gorgonzola, and crunchy bread until you get a total of 3 layers: finish with the apple pieces drizzled with gorgonzola sauce . Bake the flans inside the pastry rings in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 10 minutes .
Once cooked, transfer the flans onto serving plates, gently remove the pastry rings , and garnish with a piece of crunchy bread , gorgonzola sauce, and a few rosemary needles: your guttiau bread flans with red wine and apples are ready to be served !
The guttiau bread flans with red wine and apples can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. It is recommended to briefly reheat them in the oven before serving.
If you wish, you can deglaze the apples with balsamic vinegar and finish the dish with a sprinkle of Pecorino cheese! The Teroldego wine can be replaced with another full-bodied red wine.
