instructions:
To prepare the Easter Bavarian Cream with Pistachio and Raspberries, first focus on the custard: soak the gelatin in cold water. Pour the milk and vanilla extract into a saucepan , then heat on the stove. Meanwhile, put the egg yolks with the sugar in a bowl and mix with a whisk .
Pour the egg yolk and sugar mixture into the saucepan with the milk and heat to 185°F, stirring constantly to prevent it from sticking to the bottom . Transfer everything into a bowl, add the well-wrung gelatin sheets , and stir to dissolve completely.
Add the pistachio paste and mix well . Cover with cling film in contact and place in the refrigerator to cool for an hour.
In the meantime, prepare the raspberry jelly: soak the gelatin in cold water. Place the raspberries in a saucepan, then add the sugar and water . Bring to a boil and cook over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes. When the raspberries have broken down, turn off the heat and blend with an immersion blender .
Strain the mixture with a fine-mesh chinois and collect the liquid in a bowl . Add the well-wrung gelatin sheets and stir to dissolve completely. Transfer everything into an 18 cm oval mold lined with cling film .
Place in the refrigerator and let it set for an hour . Now focus on the sauce for decoration: put the raspberries and sugar in a saucepan and reduce over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes until it has a jam-like consistency .
Remove from heat and blend with an immersion blender . Strain with a fine-mesh sieve to remove the seeds , then transfer to a piping bag and keep in the refrigerator.
Proceed with the biscuit preparation: pour the sugar and softened butter into the bowl of a stand mixer , then beat until soft. Add the egg yolks, one at a time , until they are fully incorporated. Alternatively, you can beat them quickly and add them in a slow stream to the mixer. In a bowl, combine the egg whites and sugar .
Beat the egg whites until stiff with an electric mixer , then gradually incorporate them into the butter mixture , alternating with the sifted flour . Mix until you get a homogeneous batter.
Spread the batter on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and level with a spatula . Bake in a preheated static oven at 430°F for 8-10 minutes .
Remove from the oven and flip the biscuit onto another sheet of parchment paper , then immediately cover with cling film; this way, it will remain moist and elastic. Let cool, then cut out the biscuit with a 21 cm oval mold. To make the Bavarian cream, pour the cream and sugar into a bowl , then semi-whip the mixture with an electric mixer .
Add the semi-whipped cream to the custard in 3 parts , stirring to achieve a homogeneous mixture . Transfer the Bavarian cream into a piping bag .
Place the same oval mold used for the biscuit on a tray with parchment paper and line it with cling film. Fill the mold with more than half of the Bavarian cream , leaving a space in the center where you will insert the raspberry jelly . Cover with the remaining Bavarian cream .
Smooth the surface and let it set in the freezer for 8 hours. After chilling, place the biscuit on a serving plate .
Carefully unmold the Bavarian cream on top of the biscuit ; if necessary, you can slightly warm the mold with a torch. Finally, decorate with raspberry sauce as desired . Let rest in the refrigerator for an hour before serving your beautiful Easter Bavarian Cream with Pistachio and Raspberries !
The Easter Bavarian Cream with Pistachio and Raspberries can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, well covered with cling film or inside an airtight container.
If you prefer, you can substitute the pistachio paste with melted white chocolate or a dark chocolate ganache.
Alternatively to raspberries, you can use a mix of blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries to make the jelly.
