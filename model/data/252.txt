Cassoeula with polenta is one of those classic winter dishes you'll find in Lombardy. And here's the thing, at Ratanà, chef Cesare Battisti gives this cassoeula recipe a super fresh twist that folks can't stop talking about. Instead of the usual messy mix of meat and cabbage, he compacts all the tender pork cuts into a neat terrine. Pretty simple. This makes it easy to slice and serve without losing any of that old-school flavor. People in the region have always loved the combo of rich pork and hearty cabbage, especially since it uses those less prized cuts that were common in traditional Italian stew . Polenta on the side makes it all come together—soaking up the moist, golden juices and bringing out everything you love about Italian comfort food.
There's something really warm and inviting about that soft, buttery polenta next to the succulent pork, especially when the cold weather hits. Really, it's perfect. While most folks think of cassoeula as super rustic, this version keeps all the deep, rich taste while giving it a bit of an update. And you know, regional Italian cooking means using local ingredients, and in Lombardy, that always includes verza cabbage and a good mix of pork—nothing fancy, just honest, hearty flavors. By pressing the meat together in a terrine, you get the same comforting feel of a pork and cabbage stew, but it's way less messy and a little more fun to eat. Love it.
This cassoeula with polenta really captures the heart of Lombard cuisine : food that respects tradition but isn't afraid to change things up. It shows how Italian winter dishes can be both timeless and fresh at the same time, giving you something satisfying and memorable. This dish is not just about what's on the plate; it's about bringing people together for a meal that feels a bit special while still keeping those roots in regional Italian cooking . Whether you're sharing it with family or friends, this dish is bound to leave a lasting impression—making every bite a taste of Lombardy's culinary history. Seriously good stuff.

To prepare the revisited cassoeula with polenta, first cut the pig's foot , tail , and ear into smaller pieces.
Do the same with the snout , rind , and verzini sausages . Alternatively, you can ask your trusted butcher to do it for you.
Also cut the ribs into pieces, place them on a baking tray , and cook in a static oven at 284°F (140°C) for about 20 minutes .
Immerse the other pig parts in boiling water and cook for about 20 minutes, occasionally removing the foam from the surface . After this time, drain everything and add it to the ribs in the baking tray . Keep warm.
Heat a generous swirl of oil in a large saucepan, then add the finely chopped onion, carrot, and celery and sauté gently . When the sauté has softened, add the pieces of rind and foot .
Cover with cold water , salt , and pepper. Close with the lid and cook on low heat for about 40 minutes.
In the meantime, deal with the cabbage: remove the base , then cut it in half and chop it into large pieces, including the outer leaves .
After 40 minutes of cooking, add the cabbage to the saucepan , then add the pieces of snout, ear, and tail . Also, pour in the tomato sauce and continue cooking for another 15 minutes, always with the lid on.
At this point, add the ribs and cook with the lid on for about 90 minutes . At the end of cooking (make sure the rib meat easily separates from the bone), also add the verzini sausages , mix well, and turn off the heat.
Transfer the pieces of meat to a rack to drain excess liquid and let cool . In the meantime, reduce the cooking liquid with the cabbages on low heat for about 30 minutes , until you get a thick, glossy, flavorful sauce. Shred the meat with your hands to remove the bones and collect it in a bowl , along with the other parts of the pig.
Pour everything into a terrine measuring 8x4.3x4.3 inches (20x11x11 cm) , press down well with your hand , and cover with plastic wrap . Place a weight on top and let it rest in the refrigerator overnight.
Pour the water into a pot, add the oil and salt , and bring to a boil. When it starts to boil, rain down the cornmeal . Mix well with a whisk and cook on low heat for about 45 minutes.
When the polenta has thickened , transfer it to a terrine measuring 8x4x2.8 inches (20x10x7 cm) greased with oil . Level the surface and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to cool first at room temperature and then in the refrigerator, along with the cassoeula terrine.
After the cooling time , unmold the cassoeula terrine onto a cutting board and cut into slices about 0.8-1.2 inches thick . Transfer the slices to a baking tray and reheat in the oven at 392°F (200°C) for 20 minutes.
Also, unmold the polenta and slice it , then heat it in a skillet on both sides until golden . You are ready to plate: place a slice of crispy polenta as a base .
Add the cassoeula and drizzle with the reduced cabbage sauce . Garnish with some chervil leaves, and your revisited cassoeula with polenta is ready to be served !
The revisited cassoeula with polenta can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days in an airtight container.
You can freeze it, without the polenta.
Monitor the cooking of the cassoeula and, if necessary, add a little more salted hot water.
