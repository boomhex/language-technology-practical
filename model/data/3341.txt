To prepare the savory herb cheesecakes, start by placing the sheets of gelatin in a bowl of cold water, let them soften for about 10 minutes , and then squeeze them well. Put the tomato-flavored breadsticks in the mixer and chop them finely, then add the chopped mixture to the melted butter and mix well until you get a soft dough.
Take a muffin tray and line it with paper liners, distribute the obtained mixture in the liners (about one tablespoon per liner), and flatten and level the bases with the back of a spoon . Place everything to cool in the refrigerator for at least half an hour. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: dissolve the softened and well-squeezed gelatin in the cream (to avoid pieces of gelatin in the water, it is advisable to strain it with a sieve). Then put the ricotta, fresh cheese, salt, pepper, and chopped herbs (parsley, basil, and chives) in a bowl and mix well .
Pour the cream into the herb cheese mixture and stir until you get a homogeneous cream , then, using a piping bag, distribute the cream on the cheesecake base . Place the cheesecakes in the refrigerator for at least another hour to set the gelatin. Then carefully remove the savory herb cheesecakes from the paper liners and serve them.
