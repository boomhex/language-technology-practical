To prepare the honey and ginger pork tenderloin, start by removing the excess fat from the tenderloin and cut it into chunks about 3/4 inch thick ; if you don't like pork, you can replace it with chicken or turkey breast. Salt the pork chunks but not too much because the soy sauce will add savoriness. Cut the fresh chili pepper into julienne , if you prefer, you can remove the seeds first to reduce the spiciness.
Peel the ginger and cut it into julienne . Heat two tablespoons of sesame seed oil in a pan , alternatively, you can use another seed oil like sunflower or peanut oil.
Pour the julienned ginger into the pan first . After a couple of minutes, add the chili pepper . Flavor the oil and place the pork tenderloins using kitchen tongs .
Cook over medium-high heat to brown the chunks well on both sides, the outside should be well golden . After about 4 minutes, pour the honey
and the soy sauce and continue cooking for another 4-5 minutes or until the sauce is thick and reduced by half. The dish is ready when the honey is caramelized , serve the honey and ginger pork tenderloin hot, accompanied with raw or lightly blanched vegetables, basmati rice, or if you prefer, roasted potatoes.
Store the honey and ginger pork tenderloin in the refrigerator for no more than two days. Freezing is not recommended.
These tenderloins are wonderful: a triumph of balance between oriental and Mediterranean flavors. However, it's true that they can be modified. More delicate, by leaving the ginger whole during cooking and removing it before serving, or more flavorful, with the addition of a clove of garlic or chopped shallot? The choice is yours!
