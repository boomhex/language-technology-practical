To prepare saffron rice pudding, cut the pistachios into strips (set a few aside for decoration), remove the cardamom from the shell , and crush everything with a mortar .
Once finished , set aside and focus on the rice. Wash it under plenty of warm water 4-5 times to release the starch . Take a large pot and pour the rice
along with 500 g (17.6 oz) of cold water and a pinch of salt. Bring everything to a boil, then lower the heat. Cook the rice for 25 minutes, covering it with a lid and stirring occasionally ;
Remove any foam that forms during cooking . Mix 150 g (5.3 oz) of water with the granulated sugar and pour everything into the rice .
Stir well and cook for another 5 minutes. In a bowl, dissolve the saffron in 50 g (1.8 oz) of hot water . Stir with a teaspoon
so the saffron dissolves . Add the butter in chunks to the rice and slivered almonds (set some aside for the final presentation) .
Let the butter melt, then add the water with saffron . Stir well , then add the chopped pistachios and cardamom, and finally the rose water ,
Mix everything and cook for another 5 minutes, covering with a lid . Once ready, pour the still hot rice into 6 cups with a diameter of 3.5 inches and a height of 2.75 inches. Decorate the cups with a sprinkle of cinnamon, slivered almonds, and pistachios. Leave it in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, after which you can serve and enjoy your saffron rice pudding .
You can store the saffron rice pudding in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Cardamom has a rather strong taste, so you can use just one pod. Instead of rose water, you can also use orange blossom water, which is equally delicate and fragrant.
