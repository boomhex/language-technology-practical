instructions:
To prepare the cauliflower omelette, first take care of the cauliflower. Detach the florets (to obtain 14 oz), wash them and then blanch them in boiling salted water for about ten minutes (2-3).
Using a slotted spoon, drain the cauliflower and immerse it in a bowl with ice water to stop the cooking. Then transfer it to a dry, clean kitchen towel .
Break the eggs into a bowl , add the grated cheese and the lemon zest .
Beat everything with a whisk . At this point, pat the cauliflower florets dry to dry them well. Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan and arrange the cauliflower florets on the bottom .
When the pan is hot, pour the egg mixture over the cauliflower (13-14). At this point, cook the omelette for about 15 minutes on medium-low heat , using a fork to let the raw egg on top drip to the bottom of the pan.
Using a large plate or a lid, flip the omelette and continue cooking for another 5 minutes on the other side . Your cauliflower omelette is ready: serve it hot !
The cauliflower omelette can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days at most once cooked. Freezing is not recommended.
Add small pieces of bacon, rosemary leaves, and a tablespoon of breadcrumbs if you prefer it even more compact. If you want to use already cooked cauliflower, use 15 oz.
