To prepare the Grana cheese flan with chanterelle mushrooms, start by cutting the Grana to remove the rind . Grate it and place it in the jug of a blender. Pour in the cream ,
then the eggs and season with nutmeg . Adjust the salt and blend everything until creamy and homogeneous .
Take the molds with a diameter of 2.75 inches and a height of 2.56 inches, brush them with oil , and line them with strips of parchment paper wide enough so that the edges protrude from the molds : this way, you can more easily detach the flans from the edges once cooked. Pour the mixture inside, leaving about 0.4 inches from the edge, then place them in a baking dish with high edges and pour water (at room temperature) into the dish so that it covers the molds by a couple of inches . Cook the flans in a preheated convection oven at 320°F for 45 minutes (or static at 356°F for 50-55 minutes).
While the Grana cheese flans are cooking, clean the chanterelle mushrooms: gently brush the underside of the cap to remove traces of dirt between the folds and clean them with a soft cloth . Then cut them in half .
In a large pan, sauté a peeled and halved garlic clove, then remove it and add the mushrooms . Cook them over high heat, deglazing with white wine ; cook for about 8 minutes.
Then salt and pepper and turn off the heat . Once the flans are ready, when a delicious crust has formed on the surface , take them out of the oven, remove the parchment paper, and flip them onto a serving plate .
Then decorate each flan with chanterelle mushrooms and flakes of Grana cheese . Your Grana cheese flans with chanterelle mushrooms are ready to be enjoyed !
It is advisable to consume the Grana cheese flans with chanterelle mushrooms as soon as they are made. Otherwise, they can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 1 day.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you have specific molds for flans, you can avoid lining them with parchment paper. Once cooked, it will be sufficient to run a knife blade along the inner edge of the mold to more easily detach the flan before flipping it onto the serving plate.
You can also enjoy an excellent Grana cheese flan with porcini or honey mushrooms!
