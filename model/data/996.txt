Stewed sea snails —such a treat along the Italian coast, especially in the summer months when seafood is, frankly, at its peak. Known locally as 'lumache di mare in umido,' this dish has a way of bringing folks together. You get tender snails and a chance to soak up every drop of the flavorful sauce with some crusty bread. I mean, who can resist? The real secret to a solid sea snail stew recipe is that purging, or 'spurgatura.' It clears out the sand and grit, leaving you with just that pure, ocean-fresh taste. And the herbs? Things like wild fennel and basil give it this fragrant kick that's so so summery—pretty much a staple in traditional seafood recipes from the coast.
Travel across Italy, and you'll see different takes on stewed sea snails . Calabria, for example, might throw in a spicy twist, while up north you might find more parsley. Some folks compare it to French escargot, but the Italian version really stands out, thanks to its tangy tomato broth and bright greens. These snails? They are savory, tender, and kinda chewy—though never rubbery if done right. As an appetizer, it's a real event, especially with friends. Everyone grabs bread, swaps stories, and dives in. And once you're past the idea of pulling snails from their shells, you’ll see that cooking sea snails is about taking it slow, sharing, and savoring that taste of the sea.
For those who dig Mediterranean seafood dishes or are curious about classic mollusk recipes, this dish is an exciting mix of flavor, tradition, and a hint of adventure. And look, whether you go for the spicy Calabrian style or a milder northern version, it totally showcases Italy's rich seafood traditions. Every bite's a trip to the beautiful shores of the Mediterranean—no question. You really, really can't go wrong here.

At this point, drain them and repeat the same operation. Transfer them to the bowl with 150 g of salt , cover with a liter of water , and wait another hour. Repeat this operation again. If the water still appears dirty, you can repeat this operation to remove all impurities. When the small snails are well purged, chop the parsley and set it aside.
Do the same with the fennel . Then proceed to cook the small snails. Drain them and transfer them to a large pot. Add 40 g of salt and cover with cold water . Bring to a boil and let cook for 15 minutes.
In the meantime, start preparing the sauce for the small snails. In a pan, pour a drizzle of olive oil, add the basil and the clove of garlic , and let them sauté for a few minutes, just enough time for the aromas to release. Remove the garlic and basil with tongs and add the peeled tomatoes .
Crush them with a fork to coarsely break the peeled tomatoes and season with salt . After the 15 minutes of cooking, drain the small snails .
Transfer them to the sauce and cook for about 1 hour on low heat . After the cooking time, add the chopped parsley and fennel .
Add a pinch of pepper , a drizzle of raw olive oil , mix well and serve the stewed sea snails hot .
The stewed snails can be stored in the refrigerator for no more than one day.
When purchasing, the small snails should be very much alive so that during the boiling process they slightly come out of the shell. If the water during the purging phase appears very dirty, it's normal; just repeat the step in water and salt multiple times.
