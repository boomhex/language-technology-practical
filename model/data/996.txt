instructions:
To prepare beer-marinated tofu, start with the marinade. In a bowl, pour the beer, oil, salt, and pepper, then grate the orange zest and mix. Cut the tofu into cubes measuring 2 cm (about 0.75 inches) on each side and immerse them in the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator overnight. The next day, drain the tofu, which will now be well-flavored, and set it aside, do the same with the marinade liquid. Peel and halve the shallots; then clean the pumpkin and cut it into slices. Transfer everything to a bowl, season with the tofu marinade, and place the ingredients in a large baking dish measuring 11x16 inches. Bake in a preheated oven at 400°F for about 15 minutes or until the vegetables are well cooked. Meanwhile, braise the tofu cubes in a pan with a drizzle of oil, turning them only when they are golden on one side. Plate the tofu and vegetables, but before serving, deglaze the cooking juices from the pumpkin with beer and a splash of water. Serve the tofu with the vegetables and sprinkle with chopped chives, salt, and pepper.
Beer-marinated tofu can be stored for a couple of days, and the marinating time can be extended up to 12 hours.
If you really miss the heat, then feel free to add a nice spicy chili pepper to your beer-marinated tofu.
