When it comes to Southern Italian cuisine, baked rice with white sauce is like a warm hug on a plate. Seriously good. Perfect for family gatherings, this dish breaks away from the typical tomato-based casseroles. Instead, it dives into a cheesy, gooey delight everyone loves.
The secret? It is all in the scamorza cheese —which melts super super nicely—mingling with savory ham cubes and vibrant pops of green peas. And the sauce? Tender rice soaks it all up while a classic béchamel brings it together with a creamy richness that beats your usual oven-baked rice.
Once baked, it forms a golden and crispy crust on top—what locals call gratinatura. People in Campania and Calabria can’t get enough of it. Pretty much, it's the kind of meal that invites smiles and second helpings. Seriously. Ideal for Sunday lunches or cozy dinners.
Unlike the riso al forno up north—with tomato and mozzarella—this southern version sparkles with cheesy baked rice gratin charm. I gotta say, there’s something really special about how the cheese stretches with every forkful. And look, the ham and peas add flavor without complicating things. And in places like Campania and Calabria, folks stick to easy-to-find ingredients. Thing is, the result is rich and moist. For those who crave a creamy baked rice that’s a perfect comfort food rice recipe , this dish is just it.
And here's the thing, whether it’s a birthday, holiday, or just because you feel like it, that crispy top and tender interior make it a hit with both adults and kids. It's an easy baked rice recipe that needs no fancy stuff—just like you'd have at a big Italian family gathering. Cannot go wrong.
