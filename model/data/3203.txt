Cabbage rolls , or involtini di verza—what a classic!—are super popular in Northern and Central Italy, especially when it gets chilly. You know, these rolls use Savoy cabbage with its big, crinkly leaves, and when they're steamed, they become tender and a bit moist. Seriously good stuff. Inside, there's this ground meat stuffing made from pork, seasoned with fennel seeds. And, look, that's a classic touch in Italian cooking. Regions like Lombardy and Tuscany are big fans—no question.
What makes this version stand out is the pairing with schiacciate—crispy, flatbreads from Liguria or Tuscany. Honestly, you get a tasty contrast between the soft, juicy rolls and the golden, crunchy bread. Pretty much perfect for an aperitivo or a cozy starter when friends come over on a cold night. This Italian stuffed cabbage dish is charmingly simple, doesn't require anything fancy, and it's really, really comforting.
The filling? Rustic yet refined, thanks to the fennel. Schiacciate are usually cut into small squares or fingers, making them ideal for party finger foods. These stuffed cabbage rolls stay moist inside and develop a slightly crispy edge if baked—way better than expected—while the bread soaks up the juicy flavors beautifully. Some folks like adding a bit of tomato sauce on top, but honestly, they're delicious on their own.
This cabbage roll recipe perfectly captures the essence of traditional Italian recipes —simple, a touch rustic, yet always super tasty. It's the kind of comfort food Italians love, and you'll want to make it again whenever you need something quick but a little special. Enjoy this homemade Italian dish that warms the heart and delights the palate.
To prepare the cabbage rolls on smashed bread, start by cleaning the onion, carrot, and leek and finely chopping them. Place a pan on the stove, add a drizzle of oil and add the chopped vegetables. Then put them in the pan and sauté for 10 minutes over moderate heat. Add the ground meat , salt, pepper, and season with fennel .
and let it cook over high heat for about 15 minutes . In the meantime, take care of the cabbage, remove 4 leaves and remove the central rib .
Blanch them for a few minutes in salted boiling water that you have flavored with 2 sprigs of thyme. Then drain the cabbage leaves and pat them dry with a paper towel. With a knife, cut the leaves in half lengthwise and place a spoonful of minced meat in the center .
Then form the roll, first folding the long sides and then the short sides, and then fold them over themselves to close them . Then place the meat-filled rolls on the smashed bread and serve!
Consume the cabbage rolls on smashed bread immediately or store them in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for up to one day.
To further flavor the cabbage rolls, you can deglaze the meat, if you prefer, with red wine or white wine and enrich the filling with a cube of melting cheese.
