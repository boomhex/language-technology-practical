Cinesini alla crema —oh man, these are super tasty Italian treats. Seriously, not your average Italian cream puffs . We're talking about soft, delightful discs made from a light oil-based pastry. And you know what? They feel almost tender with every bite. The true magic is in the smooth Italian pastry cream inside. It's so moist and lovely. Then, there's the crispy crunch of hazelnut granules on the outside. It's just a fantastic mix of flavors and textures. Really, really good.
Every bite is sweet but never too heavy, so they're perfect after a big meal—especially with coffee. You'll see them next to other favorites like Cannoncini or Bignè alla crema, but Cinesini alla crema have this relaxed elegance. Perfect for fancy gatherings or casual hangouts—whichever you prefer.
All over Italy, you'll find slight twists on the Cinesini alla crema recipe . But honestly, the essentials are the same—light pastry, rich cream, and those nutty bits. Which is great. People love how easy they are to make. Just shape the dough, fill it, and add the nuts. And done! They're right at home with other traditional Italian desserts like Sicilian Sciù or Zeppole di San Giuseppe. But the thing is, they're not overly showy.
Their golden and delicate look makes them a favorite. The hazelnut coating is awesome—it gives a satisfying crunch against the soft center. It's this balance that everyone loves. You'll see these pastries in bakeries all over Italy. Simple Italian baking techniques that create something special—without the fuss. Whether you're setting up a buffet table or just grabbing a tasty coffee break snack, these little delights go fast. That creamy filling and nutty crunch keep people coming back for more. For real, sometimes the simplest pleasures are the best.
To prepare the cinesini, start with the shortcrust: on a pastry board (or in a bowl), place the flour, sugar , and baking powder . Mix the dry ingredients together, form a well in the center
and add the eggs inside ; break them with a fork and beat them, trying to incorporate the flour ; then add the extra virgin olive oil and
knead with your hands until you get a smooth and compact dough . Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour. This shortcrust pastry remains very soft even after baking, so we do not recommend using it as a base for other preparations.
After the resting time, take the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin into a very thin sheet, about 1/5 inch thick, and using a round cutter with a diameter of 2 inches, cut out circles . You will get about 32 circles, which will make 16 cinesini; re-knead the pasta scraps and roll them out again to get more circles. Place the discs on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper, well spaced apart and
bake them in a static oven, preheated, at 320°F for 10 minutes (if using a fan oven, 285°F for 6-7 minutes). The discs should remain light in color ; take them out of the oven and let them cool on a wire rack. Meanwhile, prepare the custard cream (for the detailed recipe card Pastry cream ): heat the milk in a saucepan with half a vanilla bean and its seeds; beat the egg yolk and sugar with a whisk in a bowl, then add the flour (alternatively, you can use cornstarch). Remove the bean with tongs and pour the warmed milk into the mixture in a trickle , blending with the whisk. Return the mixture to the heat and stir continuously until the cream thickens . Transfer the custard cream to a bowl and let it cool, storing it with a sheet of plastic wrap in contact.
Once cooled, transfer the cream into a piping bag with a star nozzle and start assembling the cinesini: take a shortcrust disc, fill it with a swirl of cream , and place another shortcrust disc on top of the cream , pressing lightly to compact the dessert and slightly squeeze out the cream . Be sure to leave the smoothest side of the shortcrust discs on the outside for better aesthetic results.
Place the hazelnut crumbs (or other nuts, such as pistachios, almonds, or walnuts) on a small plate and decorate the edges of the cinesini, rolling them in the crumbs that will stick to the cream . Keep the cinesini in the refrigerator until ready to serve, and before bringing them to the table, dust them with plenty of powdered sugar . Your cinesini with cream are now ready !
Store the cinesini with cream in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, after which they will absorb too much moisture. You can store the shortcrust discs in a tin box for 4-5 days and fill them at the moment. You can freeze the raw shortcrust and thaw it in the refrigerator when needed.
Like many other preparations, cinesini can also be 'chocolatized.' Here are three options for 'chocolatization':
- the first: replace 50 grams of flour with 50 grams of cocoa powder in the dough;
- the second: replace the custard cream filling with chocolate cream;
- the third: replace the nuts with chocolate flakes.
Naturally, the three levels can be combined as you like!
