instructions:
To prepare the offal, take the lamb innards and use a knife to separate them, also removing any excess fat. For the recipe, you will need: 4 oz of heart, 6 oz of lung, 12 oz of liver, 3.5 oz of spleen, and 3.5 oz of excess fat . Transfer everything to a colander and wash the innards well .
Transfer to a bowl and cover with water , we used 1 cup. Also, add the vinegar and bay leaves .
Cover with plastic wrap and wait a couple of hours. At this point, take a piece of the innards and cut it first into slices and then into cubes .
Repeat the same operation for all the pieces, being careful to separate them into different bowls . Now move on to the onions, peel them and slice them . Pour the oil into a pan, add the onions
and half a glass of water . Salt, cover with a lid and let the onion stew until it is well wilted. Once the onion is well wilted, add the heart pieces and stir.
Wait a few minutes, then add the lung pieces and stir again. Being tougher, they need a few more minutes of cooking. Then add the rest and stir again .
Salt, pepper , and deglaze with white wine . When the alcohol has evaporated ,
cover with a lid, leaving a small gap , and cook for 25-30 minutes . Serve the offal while still hot .
We recommend consuming the offal immediately; alternatively, it can be stored for a maximum of one day in the refrigerator.
To tone down the gamey taste of the preparation, you can add a peeled lemon wedge when you deglaze with white wine: the acidity will help to soften the taste. Then it should be removed towards the end of cooking.
For a spicy note, you can add some fresh or dried chili pepper!
