instructions:
To prepare the pasta with soy béchamel, first take care of the vegetables: wash them all. Trim the zucchini and cut it into cubes , then peel the carrot and cut it to the same size . Dice the celery stalks as well .
Proceed to the bell pepper, remove seeds and internal filaments, then cut it into cubes . Take the cherry tomatoes and cut them to the same size . Now cut the leek into rounds .
In a large pan, pour a drizzle of oil and add the leek Then add all the other vegetables, except the peas . Cook on low heat for 5-6 minutes, then salt and pepper .
Add the peas and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the water for the pasta to a boil, salt it, and add the pasta . While the pasta is cooking, take care of the béchamel. Heat the soy milk. In a saucepan, pour the oil .
Add the flour , mix with a whisk and bring to the heat. Continue stirring until you get the classic roux . Gradually pour in the hot milk .
Add a pinch of nutmeg and finish cooking until thickened, continuing to stir . Drain the pasta very al dente and transfer it to a bowl. Add the vegetables .
Add the béchamel, saving a couple of ladles and mix well . Transfer to an oven dish and add the remaining béchamel on top .
Finely chop the hazelnuts and place them on the pasta . Transfer the breadcrumbs to a bowl and add a drizzle of oil .
Mix well and sprinkle the mixture over the pasta . Grill for 5 minutes in a preheated oven at 464°F in grill mode, remove from the oven, and serve .
You can store the pasta in the fridge for 1-2 days. We do not recommend freezing.
Instead of hazelnuts, you can use another type of nut, like almonds or walnuts.
Use seasonal vegetables to enrich it!
