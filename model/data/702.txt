instructions:
To make chestnut jam, first remove any that are punctured or damaged. Place the chestnuts in a bowl, cover with water, and soak for 30 minutes . After this time, rinse the chestnuts and dry them , then make a horizontal cut about an inch long on the rounded part of the shell .
Transfer the scored chestnuts into a pot and cover with cold water , add the coarse salt and the oil .
Cook with the lid on at medium heat for 30 minutes from the boiling point . Once cooked, drain the chestnuts on a clean, damp cloth , wrap them well and let them rest for about ten minutes .
At this point, take one chestnut at a time from the cloth and remove both the shell and pellicle . Transfer 1.5 lbs of peeled chestnuts into a food processor and blend ; alternatively, you can use a food mill.
In a saucepan, pour the sugar and water and bring to a boil while stirring with a whisk . Once the sugar has dissolved, add the blended chestnuts .
Also add the seeds from a vanilla pod and cook for 10 minutes over medium heat, stirring constantly with the whisk to prevent the puree from sticking to the bottom. Finally, blend everything with an immersion blender until you get a creamy and velvety mixture .
Pour the still hot jam into jars you have previously sterilized , close them with the lid and turn them upside down . Once they have completely cooled, check that the vacuum has formed by pressing the lid in the center. Your chestnut jam is ready to be enjoyed !
Chestnut jam can be stored for about 3 months in a dark and dry place if the vacuum has been formed correctly.
Once the jar is opened, store it in the refrigerator for 3-4 days.
To calculate the exact amount of water and sugar for chestnut jam, weigh the boiled and peeled chestnuts: you will need two-thirds of the weight in water and one-third in sugar.
You can add a shot of rum towards the end of the chestnut puree cooking. Let the alcohol evaporate for a few minutes and then transfer the jam into sterilized jars.
For an even more enveloping taste of chestnut jam, you can add 2 level tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa at the end of cooking, before blending.
At the end of the chestnut puree cooking, you can add 7 oz of chopped dark chocolate and a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa, then stir to melt everything and jar as per the recipe: this way you will obtain a kind of spreadable chestnut and chocolate cream!
Homemade preparation of preserves and jams may present health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the conditions and measures necessary to ensure food safety, which industrial procedures can assure to prevent dangerous contamination. Therefore, it is important to meticulously follow food safety guidelines to reduce risks, but always keep in mind that you can never achieve the same food safety as professionally produced preserves and jams. For correct homemade preserve preparation, we refer to the Ministry of Health guidelines .
