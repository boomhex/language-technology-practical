To make teriyaki sauce, pour the sake , mirin , and soy sauce into a saucepan.
Add the sugar and bring to a boil. Let it cook over medium heat until the mixture reduces by half, stirring occasionally with a spoon : it will take about 30 minutes for the final consistency to be quite smooth and homogeneous. Once ready, let the sauce cool first at room temperature and then in the refrigerator. The teriyaki sauce is ready to be used !
Teriyaki sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for 5-6 days.
The original teriyaki sauce recipe is more fluid than what we usually find in restaurants: if you want a thicker consistency, you can add a tablespoon of cornstarch dissolved in 2 tablespoons of cold water to the mixture. Keep in mind that it will thicken further after cooling.
You can flavor the teriyaki sauce with minced fresh garlic or ginger.
It's preferable to use white sugar because brown sugar and honey would alter its flavor.
Mirin can be purchased at well-stocked supermarkets or ethnic food stores, but if you really can't find it, you can try substituting it with Marsala, Martini, or sherry.
