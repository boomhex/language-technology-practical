Since they’re bite-sized, you’ll notice guests picking these up for holiday brunch spreads, weekend breakfasts, or grab-and-go snacks on busy mornings. The gentle bite from the soft leeks blends easily with the rich taste of mushrooms , and those creamy notes mix right in with a gentle saltiness from good quality ham.

Customizing works great with these—want more veggies or prefer mild cheese? Just swap in what your kids like. Hosting a brunch or need a reliable potluck dish? Just pile these leek mushroom ham quiche bites on a platter—they always look nice with colorful greens. People come back for seconds because the savory muffins have a satisfying, creamy feel—DELICIOUS both warm or just cold from the fridge. Works for all occasions, everyday moments, and even picky eaters usually find something to love in these good , portable, family-friendly favorites.
To prepare the mini quiches with mushrooms, leeks, and cooked ham, start by cleaning and chopping the champignons; sauté a clove of garlic in a non-stick pan with two tablespoons of oil and cook the chopped mushrooms , season with salt and pepper. Meanwhile, in another pan with a tablespoon of oil, cook the cleaned and thinly sliced leeks for about 15/20 minutes .
In a bowl, beat 4 eggs with the cream , mixing well and incorporating the Grana Padano cheese , then adjust the salt and pepper. Butter 14 oven molds with a diameter of about 3 inches, or muffin molds (in this case, the mini quiches will be even smaller) and cut the puff pastry into circles with a diameter of about an inch or two wider than your molds, using a glass or a small bowl .
Finally, line the molds with the puff pastry discs and start filling them. Add the champignon and leek mixture to each quiche, the cooked ham cut into small pieces , and pour the egg, cream, and Grana Padano mixture over it until they are filled . The quiches should then be baked at 356°F (fan oven) for about 20 minutes, until they have a nice golden appearance. Serve the mini quiches with mushrooms, leeks, and ham hot!
If instead of mini quiches you wish to prepare a large classic savory pie, simply halve the dose of puff pastry (one package) while maintaining the doses of the other ingredients.
