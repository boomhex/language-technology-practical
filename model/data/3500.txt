To prepare the bavette with artichokes and sardines, start by cleaning the artichokes. Remove the outer leaves , which would be tough when cooked, and cut the artichokes in half. Extract the inner beard and cut the artichokes into not too thin strips .
Then transfer them into a bowl with very cold water and lemon . Meanwhile, take care of the green onion. Discard the green part and then the base and finally slice thinly .
In a pan, pour the oil and heat over medium heat with the garlic for a few moments, then remove it . Add the green onion to the base and sauté for a couple of minutes . Then pour a ladle of water and let it stew for 10-12 minutes .
Drain the artichokes from the water and add them to the pan . Cook everything for about 10 minutes, deglazing with the white wine halfway through cooking .
In the meantime, cut the sardine fillets into chunks of about 3/4 inch . If you don’t have fillets but whole sardines, you will need to clean them: remove the fresh sardines' heads, apply slight pressure with your fingers to open them like a book and remove the central bone, gently pulling it with your fingers. Also cut the tail with scissors and rinse the obtained fillets well under running water. Once the sardines are cut, place the pine nuts in a pan and toast them for 4-5 minutes , stirring them occasionally. At this point, throw the bavette into abundant boiling water, salted to taste .
Once your artichokes are cooked, finely chop the parsley , add it to the pan , and also add the sardines , continuing to cook for about 5 minutes.
Drain the pasta al dente and add it to the pan . Add the pine nuts , mix everything, and plate . Serve the bavette with artichokes and sardines hot!
Store the bavette with artichokes and sardines for a maximum of 1 day, closed in an airtight container and placed in the refrigerator!
For a crunchier note, add some chunks or crumbs of toasted bread!
