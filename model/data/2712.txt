Plumcake all’olio is this super tasty Italian breakfast cake that everyone's talking about—especially when it comes to choosing between butter and olive oil. The plumcake all’olio ? It goes with olive oil, and to be honest, it's a fantastic decision. This olive oil gives the cake a really moist and fragrant quality, especially with that classic orange zest from Mediterranean baking. And the double-cooking method? Total game-changer. First, you heat all the ingredients in a water bath. Keeps things consistent. Makes it extra fluffy. Pretty cool nod to traditional Italian pastry methods, right? Particularly when you're aiming for a plumcake soffice without leaning heavily on butter.
In many Italian kitchens, especially around the Mediterranean, swapping butter for olive oil is a common move for a lighter, healthier dessert. The plumcake senza burro not only offers health benefits but also tastes really, really tender and light. No heaviness here. The hint of orange brightens it up, filling the kitchen with this amazing aroma while baking. And sometimes, a splash of lemon is added, turning it into a plumcake all’olio e limone for a refreshing twist. It’s perfect with morning coffee or as an afternoon treat. A slice is soft enough to melt in your mouth, yet sturdy enough to dunk in milk or tea. Pretty much a favorite for many.
Whether you're looking for a dolce senza burro or just eager to try a unique dolce all’olio , this Italian delight hits all the right notes. Seriously. You end up with a plumcake leggero that's bursting with flavor, easy on the stomach—super light—and offers a pleasant change from the usual buttery cakes. It's a real treat that keeps you coming back for more. Shows just how versatile and appealing Mediterranean baking can be, you know?
To prepare the olive oil plumcake, start by grating the orange zest , then squeeze out 3.4 oz of juice and filter it with a sieve (2-3).
In a mixing bowl (or in a large aluminum bowl or pot), pour in the whole eggs and the orange juice , then the zest and a pinch of salt . Add the sugar as well
and place the mixing bowl on a large pot filled with water : the water in the pot should not touch the bottom of the mixing bowl. Turn on medium heat and start mixing the ingredients with a whisk. The temperature should not exceed 104°F: you can measure the temperature with a food thermometer . Once 104°F is reached, pour the mixture into a stand mixer (or use a bowl and an electric mixer), attach the whisk, and start working the mixture for at least 15 minutes.
In a bowl, pour in 2 1/2 cups of sifted flour along with the baking powder ; add it to the stand mixer a little at a time and when it is incorporated, slowly drizzle in the oil in 4 batches .
Continue mixing and gradually add the remaining 7/8 cup of flour ; when the mixture is homogeneous and foamy , transfer it to a greased and parchment-lined 12x4 inch loaf pan
level it with a spatula and bake it in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 70-75 minutes (if using a convection oven, 320°F for 60-65 minutes). Then take it out of the oven and let it cool slightly, then remove it to cool completely on a wire rack before serving.
Store the olive oil plumcake under a glass dome or wrapped in plastic wrap for 2-3 days. It can be frozen if you used all fresh, non-defrosted ingredients.
You can add chocolate chips to the mixture; to prevent them from sinking to the bottom, lightly flour them and place them in the freezer for at least 30 minutes.
