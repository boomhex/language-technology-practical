To prepare the cabbage rolls stuffed with vegetables, begin with the filling: wash the vegetables under plenty of running water, peel the carrots, cut them into strips and into 1/4 inch cubes . Do the same with the zucchini, always cutting them into cubes of the same size .
Now proceed with cleaning the pumpkin: slice it, remove the peel , and clean the internal filaments and seeds , then cut it into 1/4 inch cubes as well . You should obtain 3 1/2 ounces of cleaned pumpkin pulp.
Slice the leek and sauté it in a large non-stick pan with the oil along with the pumpkin and carrot cubes for 4 minutes, stirring with a spatula.
Add the diced zucchini and cook for another 4-5 minutes, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. In the meantime, in a separate pan, brown 3/4 oz of smoked bacon for about 3 minutes ; when it is crispy, turn off the heat and thinly slice the strips with a knife .
Once ready, divide the vegetables into 2 equal parts placing them in 2 small bowls. In both containers, add the chopped walnuts and in one, the previously sliced bacon . At this point, peel the cabbage and wash 9 leaves under plenty of cold running water ;
place a pot with salted water on the stove and boil the cabbage leaves for 5 minutes . After blanching the leaves, drain them and let them cool on a tray. Then remove the central vein by cutting a triangle with a knife , then divide the leaves in half ;
Now you can proceed to prepare the rolls, starting with the meat ones: place a spoonful of filling in the center of each cabbage leaf ; with your hands, gently roll the roll , closing it like a package .
Wrap it with a slice of smoked bacon set aside earlier . Once you've finished the meat rolls, proceed with the vegetable ones: place a spoonful of filling on the leaf and close it like a package . Slice the leek
and blanch a leaf for 2 minutes in hot water ; drain and let it cool completely. With a knife, cut threads 1/4 inch wide to close the rolls by tying a small knot .
Place a non-stick pan on the stove with a drizzle of oil and sear the vegetable rolls first for 1 minute per side, then the meat ones, seasoning with salt and turning them with kitchen tongs for even cooking . When they have taken on color, you can serve and enjoy your hot cabbage rolls stuffed with vegetables !
It is recommended to consume the cabbage rolls stuffed with vegetables immediately while hot. If you have leftovers, you can store them in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 1 day. Freezing is not recommended.
For an even more delightful dish, you can accompany the rolls with sour cream or a sauce made from mustard, honey, and chili pepper. Instead of walnuts, you can also use cashews and onion instead of leek.
