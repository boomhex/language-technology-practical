instructions:
To prepare baked pasta with mushrooms and sausage, first clean the button mushrooms: cut the base of the stem and peel the top of the mushroom . For the portobello mushrooms, just clean them with a damp cloth to remove the dirt .
Cut the portobello mushrooms into slices and the button mushrooms into quarters . Move on to the shallot, clean it, and slice it thinly .
Take care of the sausage: remove the casing and cut it into small pieces . At this point, pour a drizzle of oil into a pan, add a clove of garlic in its skin and the basil sprigs .
Heat the pan very well and add the button mushrooms , let them brown over very high heat for a few minutes, remove the basil , and add the rest of the mushrooms .
Let them brown for about 5 minutes, always over high heat, season with salt and pepper . When the mushrooms are cooked, remove the garlic and set them aside .
In another large pan, pour a drizzle of oil, add the shallot and the chili pepper. Let it brown for a few minutes, then raise the heat and add the sausage . Let it brown over high heat for about 6-7 minutes, then remove the chili pepper .
Adjust with salt and pepper and set aside. Place a pot filled with water on the stove, salted to your taste, which will be used for cooking the pasta. Now take care of the bechamel, heat the milk in a saucepan adding a pinch of salt and pepper . In another saucepan, heat the butter and as soon as it sizzles, add the flour all at once .
Quickly stir with a whisk to avoid lumps . Add the hot milk little by little and stir until it thickens .
Turn off the heat, add 5.3 oz of grated Casera cheese and mix with a spatula . Transfer the bechamel to a bowl .
Add the sautéed mushrooms to the bechamel and the thyme leaves . Meanwhile, cook the pasta .
Drain it very al dente and transfer it directly into the pan with the sausage . Add a couple of ladles of cooking water and toss the pasta well, adding the small knob of butter at the end .
Pour the bechamel directly into the pan , mix well , and pour everything into a baking dish .
Finish by sprinkling the remaining Casera and breadcrumbs on top. Bake in a preheated oven at 428°F for 15 minutes, then turn on the grill for 5 minutes. Take it out of the oven and serve your baked pasta with mushrooms and sausage!
You can store baked pasta with mushrooms and sausage in the refrigerator for 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can have fun choosing the mushrooms, using the type you prefer. Porcini or chanterelles, for example, would be perfect.
Instead of Casera, you can use another cheese.
