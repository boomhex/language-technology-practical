Place the molds in the air fryer (we used a fryer with a 6-liter capacity) and cook at 340°F for 12 minutes, then lower the temperature to 320°F and continue cooking for another 4 minutes : we cooked 4 muffins at a time in an air fryer with a 4.2-liter capacity. Your apple muffins in the air fryer are ready to be enjoyed !
Apple muffins in the air fryer can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days in an airtight container.
You can freeze the muffins after cooking and cooling them.
You can flavor the batter with lemon zest, cinnamon, or ginger instead of vanilla.
If you prefer, you can cut the apples into cubes!
The muffins may rise differently depending on how they are positioned inside the air fryer, so we recommend checking halfway through cooking to see if you need to rotate the muffin cups.
