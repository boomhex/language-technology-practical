instructions:
To prepare the savory shortcrust pastry, pour the flour into a food processor with steel blades , then add the cold butter from the fridge , the coarse salt
and the egg . Close with the lid and start the processor until you get a crumbly mixture . Transfer the mixture to a pastry board and quickly work it with your hands
to form a dough ball . Wrap the dough ball in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour. After this time, you can roll out your savory shortcrust pastry on a lightly floured surface to make a tart or tartlets !
The savory shortcrust pastry can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3-4 days, wrapped in plastic wrap. If desired, you can freeze it and store it in the freezer for about a month.
As an alternative to the food processor, you can knead by hand, making sure to work the mixture as quickly as possible. If desired, you can enrich the savory shortcrust with 2 tablespoons of grated cheese like Pecorino, Parmesan, or Grana Padano, or you can flavor it with fresh thyme, oregano, rosemary, or black pepper. For blind baking in a tart pan: preheat the static oven to 390°F, cover the shortcrust with specific baking weights or dried legumes, and bake for 15 minutes, then remove the weights and continue baking for another 10 minutes or so.
