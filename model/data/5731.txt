To prepare the oven baked omelette roll, grate the Pecorino cheese . Crack the eggs open and place them in a bowl, add salt , pepper, and then the Pecorino cheese .

Flavor with the oregano , stir into a homogeneous mixture using a whisk . Grease a rectangular 13x10x1.2" tray with oil, using a brush .
Lay the parchment paper over it , make sure it adheres well, and then grease it too . Add the egg mixture .
Bake in a static oven preheated to 355°F for 10 minutes on the middle shelf. Remove from the oven when done and place a sheet of plastic wrap over a cutting board .
Turn the omelette over onto the plastic wrap and remove the parchment paper. Top with the provola cheese , be sure to add even more on one of the short sides, and that the cheese slightly overlaps the edges, to close the roll better. Top with the prosciutto cotto .
Start rolling the omelette from the short side without extra provola cheese, use the plastic wrap underneath if necessary . Thoroughly seal both edges shut after completing the roll . Now remove the plastic wrap and cut the oven baked omelette roll into slices .
You can store the oven baked omelette roll in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for up to 2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can flavor the omelette base with whatever herbs you prefer, such as parsley, thyme, marjoram or rosemary. Provola cheese can be replaced with smoked scamorza cheese, pizza mozzarella or Asiago cheese. Prosciutto cotto can be replaced with prosciutto crudo, speck, or other cold cuds. Pecorino cheese helps balance the strong egg taste while adding flavor. Parmigiano Reggiano, grana padano or a mix of grated cheeses can also be used. For an even more delicious result, place the roll in a static oven at 355°/390° to melt the cheese a little.
