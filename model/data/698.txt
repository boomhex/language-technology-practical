instructions:
To prepare the pumpkin crunch, first clean the pumpkin: remove the skin , extract the seeds and inner filaments , and cut 250 g of flesh into cubes .
In a bowl, pour the flour and water, stirring with a whisk to avoid lumps . Once you have a smooth and homogeneous mixture, add the salt and rosemary needles , and mix everything well.
Add the pumpkin as well and incorporate it into the mixture with a ladle . Oil and flour a pan with a diameter of 11-12 inches , then remove any excess flour.
Pour the mixture inside and level it with the back of a spoon , then dust the surface with cornmeal .
Drizzle with a little olive oil and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 50 minutes, then continue baking for another 10 minutes in fan mode at 428°F . Your pumpkin crunch is ready to be enjoyed !
The pumpkin crunch can be stored in the refrigerator for about 2 days.
The cooking process is the most important part to make this recipe a success! Times and temperatures may vary from oven to oven, so we recommend checking the color and texture: when the surface is golden and crunchy, the crunch is ready; if you find that the inside is still too soft, lower the temperature and continue to cook for a few more minutes.
If desired, you can also add white onion to the mixture.
