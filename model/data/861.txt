When it comes to hearty, comforting meals, baked pasta with broccoli and pancetta is a total favorite in Southern Italian kitchens. Originating from the classic pasta al forno, this dish is spot-on for cooler months when broccoli is everywhere. And you know what? Adding broccoli brings a tender bite and a splash of green, while the baked pasta ensures those golden, crispy edges and gooey cheese pulls that everyone loves. Seriously good stuff. Pancetta adds a salty, crispy kick—making each bite more exciting. In regions like Puglia and Calabria, broccoli is a staple in many dishes, from orecchiette with sausage to stuffed panzerotti. Here, it turns a simple dish into something that feels like a warm hug on a chilly day. Thing is, the combo of broccoli pasta and savory pork is a favorite at Southern tables, especially when it is cold outside, offering a rich and melting hot delight straight from the oven.
While broccoli often gets labeled as just a healthy veggie, in this pancetta pasta dish, it transforms into something everyone looks forward to. The moist, cheesy top layer gives way to pasta that has soaked up the flavors of pancetta and melted cheese. So good. Some families like to add extra cheese for a thicker golden crust, while others sprinkle in a bit of nutmeg for added warmth. Also, this kind of baked pasta recipe fills the kitchen with a really, really good aroma, drawing everyone to the table—even those who claim not to like broccoli. Pretty much a win. It’s clear why such dishes remain popular in Italy; they’re simple, filling and hit all the right notes: crispy pancetta, savory pork, and those tender green veggies enhanced by cheese. If you're looking for a dish that's both special and easy to prepare, this easy baked pasta is a winner. Not only does it satisfy cravings for something rich and comforting, but it also showcases the versatility and deliciousness of traditional Southern Italian ingredients. For sure.

To make baked pasta with broccoli and bacon, first separate the florets from the stalk : after cleaning, you will get about 550 grams (19.4 oz) of florets (do not throw away the stalk: once peeled, you can use it as indicated at the bottom of the recipe). Wash the florets well under running water, then boil them for about 5-6 minutes in boiling water . Once cooked, drain and set aside; do not discard the cooking water as it will be used to cook the pasta.
Cut the florets into smaller pieces . Meanwhile, cut the bacon into cubes , heat a pan over medium heat, and when it is hot, add the bacon : sauté for about 10 minutes without adding any extra fat.
The bacon should be golden and crispy . Add the broccoli here . Meanwhile, bring the water in which you cooked the broccoli back to a boil, add salt, and cook the pasta , cooking it a few minutes less than stated on the package instructions.
While the pasta is cooking, cut the Casera cheese into cubes . When the pasta is al dente, drain it directly into the pan with the rest of the ingredients ; stir to flavor. Turn off the heat, then grease a baking dish of about 12 inches in diameter with 2 tablespoons of oil .
Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of grated Grana Padano on the bottom . Pour in a first layer of pasta , season with half the amount of cubed Casera cheese . Continue with a final layer of pasta.
Top the final layer with more Casera cheese, grated Grana Padano , and a drizzle of olive oil . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 15 minutes on the middle rack.

As an alternative to Casera cheese, you can use another semi-hard cheese like caciocavallo or fontina. Do not throw away the broccoli stalk: once you remove the tougher outer part, it can be boiled and perhaps blended to make a delicious cream to dress pasta, rice, or spread on crostini!
