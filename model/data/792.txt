instructions:
To prepare mountaineer-style vermicelli, first put a pot with plenty of water on the stove to boil for cooking the pasta. Wash and halve the cherry tomatoes , then peel the onion and chop it finely . Remove the casing from the sausage and roughly chop it. Heat a pan with a drizzle of oil .
Sauté the onion for 3-4 minutes, then add the sausage . When the sausage is well browned, deglaze with white wine and let the alcohol evaporate completely. Add the cherry tomatoes and season with salt and pepper.
Strip the wild fennel directly into the pan and cook over high heat for a few minutes. Meanwhile, cook the vermicelli in the boiling water . Drain the pasta al dente and transfer it to the pan with the sauce .
Mix everything well, adding a ladle of cooking water , then remove the pan from the heat and toss with the grated Pecorino cheese . Serve your mountaineer-style vermicelli with freshly ground black pepper to taste !
It is recommended to consume mountaineer-style vermicelli immediately.
If you wish, you can further enrich mountaineer-style vermicelli with champignon mushrooms.
