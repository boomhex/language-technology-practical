If you're a fan of éclair recipes , get ready for a treat because this classic French pastry is something special. Direct from the heart of France, the éclair is crafted with a light choux dough—really, it’s the same dough you’d use for cream puffs. But here's the deal: it’s all in how you pipe it to get those perfect, slender forms. And the filling? That's where it gets good, really good. The cream-filled éclair achieves that smooth center using a special pastry cream with two types of starch.
Sounds a bit technical, I know. But it’s what makes the inside so velvety—and prevents any clumps. Keeping the cream just right in temperature is key. I mean, it stays moist without losing shape, which is awesome. This attention to detail? Well, it sets these éclairs apart from others.
Now, when you're finishing up your homemade éclairs , that’s where the fun kicks in. It’s not just about the filling—though a good whipped cream filling really, really elevates the experience. A swirl of light, sweet cream inside gives every bite that melt-in-your-mouth feeling. Plus, while a simple chocolate glaze is a classic choice, many add fresh strawberries, currants, or a sprinkle of elderflower for a fresh twist. And look, these little touches make the éclair look fancy without being fussy. Pretty simple, right?
Éclairs are about great dough, a smooth pastry cream, and fun decorations. The combo of the tender pastry and cool cream makes them a hit for anyone who loves a treat that feels special but not over the top. And here's the thing, whether you stick to the classic or play around with different flavors and toppings, this dessert recipe is sure to have everyone talking and coming back for more. Seriously, you cannot go wrong.

To prepare the cream-filled éclairs with whipped cream, start with the choux pastry. In a saucepan, pour the water and milk . Add sugar and salt .
Add the butter and heat the mixture until it reaches a boil and the butter is completely melted . Now, off the heat, add the flour .
Stir with a wooden spoon , until it is completely absorbed . Now return to the stove and cook the mixture, stirring often, until it pulls away from the sides and looks dry , which will take a few minutes.
Pour the resulting dough into a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix quickly to cool it down to 140°F. Now add the eggs one at a time , until you get a smooth, shiny, and warm mixture . Transfer to a piping bag with a 12 mm plain nozzle.
Now shape the éclairs using the special perforated mat , transfer it to the oven rack , and bake in a preheated static oven at 365°F for about 30-35 minutes. During the last 5 minutes, open the oven door to release excess moisture. When the éclairs have reached a nice hazelnut color, you can take them out of the oven . Let them cool completely and in the meantime prepare the cream.
Pour into a saucepan the milk and 110 g of cream (the remaining 15 g will be used later) , add the seeds extracted from the vanilla bean , and bring everything to a boil. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the sugar with the cornstarch .
Add the rice starch, a pinch of salt , and mix . Then add the egg yolks to the bowl with the dry ingredients .
Stir with a spoon or spatula until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous mixture. As soon as the milk starts to boil, take about one ladle and pour it into the egg yolk mixture . Stir to temper it .
Then pour everything back into the saucepan with the remaining milk . Stir continuously with a whisk in a vigorous manner . The cream must reach a temperature of 180°F-183°F to be ready .
Transfer the cream to a bowl with ice water to cool it quickly . Add the remaining 15 g of cream and stir until no longer hot. Transfer to a low wide bowl, cover with plastic wrap in contact, and let cool in the fridge for at least 2 hours.
After two hours, cut the éclairs with scissors, making a cut on the top . Transfer the cream to a piping bag without a nozzle and use it to fill the éclairs . With a spatula, remove the excess cream .
Now pour the cold cream into a bowl, add the sugar , and whip it with electric beaters . Transfer it to a piping bag with a star nozzle and use it to decorate the éclairs .
Finally, decorate with quartered strawberries , grated lemon zest , currants, and elderflowers. The cream-filled éclairs with whipped cream are ready; store them in the fridge until serving time !
Both the empty and filled éclairs can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. The unfilled éclairs can be frozen.
If you don't have the special mat, don't worry. You can create the choux pastry sticks on a baking sheet previously buttered and then lined with parchment paper. They should be about 5x1 inches.
Use medium-strength flour. For the cream, it is preferable to use both types of starch, otherwise the consistency of the cream will change.
