Peel and finely chop the onions ; cut the beef into pieces about 1-1.5 inches on each side . In a saucepan, melt the butter and add the bacon, allowing it to brown ; once golden, remove it from the pan and set it aside .
In the fat released by the bacon, add the onions and let them brown on low heat for about 15 minutes, covering the pan with a lid ; stir the onions occasionally until they are completely wilted, then remove the lid and add the brown sugar and mix it perfectly with the onions to caramelize .
Transfer the onions to a sieve (or strainer) and, pressing them with a spoon, let the excess fat drain : set aside both the onions and the fat.
Preheat the oven to 320°F. Mix the flour with ground pepper and salt and roll the meat in it until completely coated; brown the meat in a little oil in batches, adding the drained fat from the onions little by little.
As you brown the meat, set it aside, and when finished, pour vinegar and then beer into the now-empty pan to deglaze the cooking base. Bring to a boil and scrape the pan well to obtain a brown liquid,
to which you will add thyme leaves and bay leaves . Take a rather deep baking dish (or ovenproof pan) and arrange a layer of onions , a layer of meat ,
some bacon and then repeat the layers until you have used all the ingredients. Pour the liquid from the pan over the meat , then take the two slices of sandwich bread (or loaf), remove the outer crust
and spread them with strong mustard , then place them close together with the spread side on the meat . Cover the baking dish with a double layer of aluminum foil sealing the edges well, then bake in the preheated oven for about 2 hours.
You can also prepare the Flemish Carbonade with light Belgian beer and add chopped parsley at the end of preparation.
If you prefer, you can use golden onions instead of white ones, a loaf instead of sandwich bread, speck instead of bacon, and wild boar meat instead of beef.
