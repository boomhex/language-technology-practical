Puccia Salentina is the kind of Italian flatbread that really captures the essence of the sun-baked streets of Puglia. And look, it's everywhere in Salento and Taranto. This bread, really, is a local pride thing—bringing people together for a quick, crispy bite. Baked in a wood-fired oven, it's got this golden, hollow inside with almost no crumb. Perfect for stuffing. Really perfect. Some folks go for simple, like cured meats and cheeses, while others go full Puglian with stewed horse meat or roasted veggies. The classic kind is tender on the inside, with a crunchy crust. It's a real celebration of Puglian cuisine . No question why it is a star of the Salento street food scene—this bread is rustic, practical, and full of unforgettable flavor.
Back in the day, Puccia Salentina was a staple for farmers working long hours. I mean, its portability and filling nature made it perfect for a tough day. For real, people still love this traditional Puglian bread —it’s sturdy, simple, super versatile. You can choose different versions, like the soft and moist olive kind or the pizza-style one that's got a bit more chew. Making a homemade Puccia lets you bring an authentic taste of Puglia to your table—seriously good stuff. And there's something special about creating your own fragrant, warm pocket for whatever fillings you desire. Whether you use it for an authentic Italian sandwich or just enjoy it plain, this bread shows why Italian bread recipes from the south are so beloved. It’s a slice of regional pride, ready to soak up big flavors and good company, making it so much more than just another flatbread. So next time you’re in the mood for something unique, give Puccia Salentina a try and experience a true taste of Puglia. Really, you will not regret it.
To prepare the Salento puccia, start by sifting the flour into the bowl of a stand mixer , then add the dehydrated yeast and malt .
Turn on the stand mixer with the paddle attachment and pour in the oil slowly ; also add the lukewarm water gradually and mix everything for a few minutes. When the mixture becomes a single mass, add the salt .
Continue mixing for a couple of minutes, just enough time for the dough to absorb the salt , then replace the paddle with the dough hook. Turn the mixer back on at medium speed for about 10-15 minutes, until you get a very smooth and elastic dough. When the dough has gathered , place the mixture on a greased work surface and knead it lightly by hand .
With your hands, try to shape it into a sphere , then place it in a fairly large bowl greased with a little oil . Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise in the turned-off oven with the light on for about 2-3 hours (the indicated temperature is 82-86°F), until it has doubled in volume .
Transfer the dough to a floured surface and, working it with your hands, try to form a loaf . Cut out 18 portions of about 3 oz each, using a dough scraper or the blade of a knife.
Take each piece of dough and, holding it in your hand, make a circular motion to form spheres . Roll out your balls of dough on a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin until you get discs about 8 inches in diameter.
Gently place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake at 482°F in a preheated static oven for about 15 minutes (if using a convection oven, bake at 446°F for about 10 minutes). After the required time, remove your puci from the oven and serve them while still hot .
Among the various possibilities to fill your puccia, we at Giallo Zafferano have chosen to suggest the one with Horse stew . Cut your puccia in half without applying pressure , fill it with the prepared stew , and serve it while still hot!
For a more fragrant taste, serve your puccia piping hot; alternatively, you can store them for 1-2 days in a bag, preferably paper. You can freeze them once cooked.
If you prefer, you can make the dough the night before, leave it in the refrigerator overnight, and let it come to room temperature for about 2 hours before dividing it.
The puccia “cu lle ulie” represented the quick and poor lunch of the farmers: a crispy bread on the outside and soft inside, made with potatoes and enriched with black olives. Today’s tradition is to still prepare it, especially on the eve of the Immaculate Conception.
