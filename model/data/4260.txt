instructions:
The air fryer fish fry is a light yet flavorful second course, ideal for those who love the taste of the sea without sacrificing a lighter preparation compared to the classic mixed fry . The dish features three traditional classics: shrimp, squid, and anchovies, each with its own characteristics.
Cooking in an air fryer allows for a golden and crispy coating with reduced fat content, without excess oil or lingering odors. The shrimp remain tender and flavorful, the squid retain their natural tenderness, while the anchovies, fragrant and savory, complete the dish with a bold note.
This version of the air fryer fish fry is perfect to serve as a second course or in a mixed appetizer, perhaps accompanied by a delicate mayonnaise or some lemon wedges. A lighter alternative to the usual fry, but with all the authentic taste of fish!
