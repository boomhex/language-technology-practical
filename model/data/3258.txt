To prepare cassata coffee, sift the ricotta with a sieve , add the powdered sugar , also sifted, and mix everything with broad and quick movements to whip the mixture. Add the chocolate chips and candied fruit ,
then mix well to combine all the ingredients . Transfer the cream into a piping bag and place it at the bottom of four medium glass cups . Meanwhile, prepare the sponge cake (by following the recipe you find Sponge cake ) and let it cool. At this point, take the sponge cake and cut it horizontally in half, obtaining two discs. From one of the discs, cut out four circles with a diameter of about 2 1/3 inches using a round cutter. Place a sponge cake disc in each glass and put everything in the refrigerator to rest for a couple of hours.
Now prepare the coffee using a moka pot. To obtain excellent coffee, fill the boiler of your moka pot with cold water, preferably low in lime scale, making sure not to exceed the safety valve (otherwise you will get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee, forming a “small mound“ , which you will level by tapping the filter on the table with firm movements . Do not press with the spoon or make holes on the surface.
Screw the moka pot tightly (to prevent the coffee from escaping from the sides as it rises), then place it on a low and steady flame to get a full-bodied coffee. As the coffee rises, a thick foam will form ; we recommend not letting it bubble for too long to preserve its aroma and sweetness. Your coffee is ready: before pouring it, stir it directly in the moka with a teaspoon to make it more homogeneous. Take the glasses out of the refrigerator and complete everything by pouring a small cup of hot coffee (about 1.4 oz) into each one : cassata coffee is ready to be enjoyed!
We recommend consuming cassata coffee immediately.
If you wish, you can prepare the glasses with the cream even the day before, keeping them in the refrigerator (covered with plastic wrap) until the moment to pour the hot coffee. With the leftover sponge cake, you can prepare delicious cake pops, Cake pops
