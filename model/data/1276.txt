There's just something about blueberry biscotti —especially when they're shaped like cute little flowers. Really nice, right? This blueberry biscotti recipe skips the eggs, making them lighter but still keeping that classic crisp texture we all love in Italian biscotti. Imagine this: everyone gathers around to help shape the dough into tender petals. And—of course—sneak a taste of those sweet dried blueberries that dot each piece. Twice-baked to perfection, these cookies are really, really a joy. They've got their golden edges and bursts of fruity flavor in every bite. Whether it is breakfast or an afternoon snack, these biscotti pair perfectly with a hot cup of coffee or tea—giving you that extra moist bite when dunked. So good.
And you know what? What makes homemade blueberry biscotti even better is how they can become a thoughtful gift. Picture this: wrapping them up in pretty bags or boxes to share with friends and family. Seriously, it's hard not to smile when you get a batch made just for you. Making these cookies is a way to show care—with everyone adding a personal touch to the flower shapes. You might even sprinkle in some lemon zest or almond for a twist, creating a blueberry lemon biscotti or a blueberry almond version. These aren't tied to any specific Italian region, which is great, but they're enjoyed all over Italy. Cherished for their simple and cheerful nature. For those who love a treat that's a bit sweet and not too heavy, this easy blueberry biscotti hits the spot. Imagine this: whether you're sharing them around the table or packing them up for someone special, the whole process makes regular days a bit brighter and more delicious. Imagine sitting at a table in a cozy Italian kitchen—the aroma of fresh biscotti filling the air—bringing people together in a moment of shared joy. And cannot go wrong with that.
To make the blueberry cookies, take the berries out of the freezer about ten minutes before use, rinse them, and pat them dry. Pour the all-purpose flour, powdered sugar , and cold butter from the fridge cut into pieces into a bowl, then crumble the mixture quickly to avoid excessively warming it .
Add the blueberries , the zest and juice of half a lemon , and knead quickly to create a uniform mixture .
While kneading, crush the blueberries well with your fingers . Form your dough by finishing working it on the work surface , flatten it slightly, and wrap it with plastic wrap . Let it rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour.
After the resting time, roll it out to a thickness of about 1/8 inch and cut it with a cookie cutter (we chose a flower shape) , being careful to knead the scraps again until you use all the dough. You should obtain about 30 cookies (depending on the size of the cutter you use).
As you form the cookies, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , then bake in a preheated static oven at 330°F for about 25 minutes. Take the blueberry cookies out of the oven, let them cool on a rack, and then serve them !
Store the blueberry cookies for about a week in a jar or a paper bag.
The raw dough can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, but freezing is not recommended.
It is recommended to follow the recipe using frozen blueberries (or raspberries) because using fresh ones would not yield the same result.
You can flavor the cookies with blended mint or basil leaves.
