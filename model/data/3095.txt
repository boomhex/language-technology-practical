Bicchierini alla birra con crema al parmigiano is one of those clever Italian snacks that's both a little fancy and super approachable. Picture this: crispy, golden cups made from beer-infused pastry— pasta brisè alla birra . Yeah, it adds a hint of malty beer flavor. Not something you find in your average party snack, right? Inside, there's this parmesan cheese appetizer filling. It's kinda like a béchamel sauce, but, and here's the thing, it’s amped up with a ton of grated Parmigiano Reggiano.
What really makes it pop? The creamy contrast with a sweet pear compote. Seriously good. You sauté pears with butter and sugar until they're soft and slightly jammy. And look, it’s classic in northern Italy, especially around Emilia-Romagna. These bite-sized shells are perfect for a beer and cheese pairing at your next hangout.
These little cups are loved for the perfect mix of tender pastry and rich, savory cream with that sweet fruit hit. It's not just about flavor—the textures really work, too. The shortcrust shell stays crispy outside, while inside? So so soft. It's like a beer cheese dip you eat with a spoon, but wrapped up like this, it feels special. Beer and cheese fans will be thrilled. For real. And anyone who likes an easy appetizer recipe will see why these vanish fast at gatherings.
Even if you’re not a big cook, mixing cheese and fruit in a pastry cup is pretty simple. And the sauce? A fun twist on what Italians have been doing for ages. Serve these with a cold beer and you'll see how the tangy Parmigiano and sweet pears just click. Everyone will want more. You'll feel like you've pulled off something way fancier than it really is. And you know what? That's awesome.
To prepare the beer glasses with parmesan cream, start by making the beer shortcrust pastry: put the flour and butter in a mixer and blend until you get a sandy mixture. Pour the mixture onto a pastry board (or into a bowl), create a well in the center and pour the beer in a stream . Knead so that the flour absorbs all the beer and forms a nice homogeneous dough .
Transfer the dough onto a pastry board and work it with your hands ; form a ball and flatten it with your hands , then roll out the dough with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 1/4 inch .
From the dough, cut out 10 squares of about 3-4 inches and place each square into a silicone or aluminum muffin mold with a diameter of about 2 1/3 inches (or in individual molds), like the one shown in the photo . Shape your glasses by removing the excess dough with a knife, keeping in mind that the edge should be about 1 inch high. Make the edge as regular as possible and then prick the base with the tines of a fork . Now cut out squares of baking paper about 2-2 1/2 inches on each side and
place them inside your glasses, making them adhere well to the dough . Finally, insert smaller molds inside, or create a weight with dried legumes so that the glasses do not puff up or create bubbles, as you do for How to do blind baking . Bake in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 20 minutes (if using a fan oven, 320°F for 15 minutes). Once baked, let them cool and then remove the glasses from the molds onto a rack.
Now prepare the Parmigiano Cream : melt the butter in a saucepan and, once melted, add the flour in a shower, stirring with a whisk to obtain a roux . Then add the milk, which you have previously warmed, in a saucepan and stir well with the whisk.
Cook the mixture over low heat, continuing to stir until it thickens ; it will take about 8 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and gradually add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano . Mix the parmesan well into the béchamel: the consistency of the cream should be such that, if lifted with a spoon, it remains on the surface for a while before sinking .
Now prepare a pear compote: peel and dice the pears ; melt the butter in a pan, add the pears and the brown sugar .
Cook the pears for 15 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent them from sticking . Once cooked, mash the pears with a fork to release all the juice . Pour the cooked pears into a blender, blend until you obtain a thick puree, and finally squeeze a few drops of lemon .
Now you can assemble your beer glasses with parmesan cream: take your glasses and make a first layer with about 3 tablespoons of parmesan cream . Transfer the pear compote into a piping bag with a star nozzle and make the second layer over the parmesan cream, squeezing out a nice tuft . Lastly, garnish each glass with parmesan flakes and your beer glasses with parmesan cream are ready !
You can store the beer glasses with parmesan cream in the refrigerator for up to 2 days, to prevent the shortcrust base from collapsing due to the humidity of the parmesan cream and the pear puree. You can freeze the beer shortcrust still raw, in a block. Remember to defrost it in the refrigerator.
If you do not have metal molds, you can blind bake simply by covering the bottom of the glasses with baking paper and using dried chickpeas or beans. In this case, however, the shape of your glasses may not be as perfect.
