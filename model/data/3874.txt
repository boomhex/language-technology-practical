To prepare the spiced tart with strawberry jam, start by making the pastry. In a food processor, add the flour, ground cloves , ginger, ground cinnamon , and baking soda . Then also add the sugar and a pinch of salt.
Grate nutmeg into the mixer as well, then add cold, refrigerated butter in cubes and honey . At this point, turn on the mixer, being careful to pulse intermittently so as not to overheat the dough. Mix until you create a sandy texture . Then pour it onto a work surface and form a fountain, to which you will add the whole egg and beaten yolk. Mix the dough first with a fork and then with cold hands, quickly to avoid warming it too much.
Form a dough ball using a dough scraper if necessary and cover it with plastic wrap . Let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. After this time, remove it from the wrap and roll it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured work surface : you should achieve a thickness of about 0.4 inches.
Now take a perforated 9-inch pan (if you don't have one, use a pan of the same size, but you will need to butter and flour it). Using the rolling pin wrapped with the pastry, lift it and lay it over the pie dish . Use your fingertips to adhere the pastry well to the edges and with a knife, remove the excess that comes out of the mold .
Quickly reshape the excess pastry and set it aside. Prick the bottom of the tart with the tines of a fork and pour the strawberry jam into it . Level it with the back of a spoon and spread it over the entire surface of the mold .
Roll out the reshaped pastry with a rolling pin until you get a thickness of about 0.2 inches and cut strips of pastry with a pastry cutter . Place the pastry strips over the jam, creating a lattice pattern (17-18).
Brush the surface of the lattice with a beaten egg and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 60 minutes (if using a convection oven, bake at 320°F for about 50 minutes) . If it darkens too much, after 35 minutes (about 25 minutes if convection), cover with aluminum foil. Then remove your spiced tart with strawberry jam from the oven and let it cool slightly before removing it from the mold ; let it cool to firm up... then enjoy!
Once cooked, you can store the spiced tart with strawberry jam under a glass dome for 2-3 days.
We do not recommend freezing.
Want to personalize this fragrant tart? Instead of strawberry jam, you could opt for a mixed berry, blueberry, wild strawberry, or any jam that tickles your taste buds more.
And why not make the dough even more aromatic with a few drops of vanilla extract or the zest of a lemon? Try it to believe it!
