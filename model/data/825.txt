Colored eggs are a big deal on the Easter table in Italy, you know? Making them at home has this special charm, like a family tradition. And here's the thing: instead of using those artificial dyes, lots of Italian families go for natural egg dyes from things like red cabbage, onion skins, or lemon juice. Really, it gives the eggs these soft pastel shades. Super pretty. Especially when they’re all lined up together, looking gorgeous.
Making these dyed eggs is like a mini science project for the kids. The kitchen turns into a mess—a fun mess. Everyone gets their hands a bit messy and has some laughs, for sure. Once the eggs are boiled, you dunk them into pots of naturally colored water. End up with shells that are gentle in color—think light blue, rose and yellow. Totally different. I mean, they’re not like those bright Easter eggs you grab from store kits. And, no worry about weird aftertastes or chemicals. Honestly, it’s a fun twist on Easter egg decorating .
In lots of Italian homes, these Easter eggs are not just for decoration—they’re actually pretty tasty as an appetizer. You peel off those colorful shells, and the eggs can be sliced. Drizzle them with olive oil, sprinkle some salt and pepper, maybe add fresh thyme leaves. Soft white and yolk pick up a hint of flavor from the natural dyes, just enough to make things interesting. Really really good.
You’ll often find deviled eggs on Easter tables, sometimes called ‘Uova ripiene’ or ‘Uova alla diavola,’ made using the same egg coloring techniques . Each region in Italy seems to have its own favorite way to dress them up. But the whole idea? Something that looks as good as it tastes. For those who enjoy a hands-on holiday project and a bit of creativity, these eggs are a pretty classic pick during the spring celebrations. They bring that touch of Italian tradition to the table—celebrating both the visual appeal and delicious flavors of these uniquely colored eggs . Seriously good.

To prepare colored eggs, first cut the red cabbage into pieces . Immerse the red cabbage in water and let it cook for 30 minutes .
Meanwhile, immerse the eggs in boiling water, using a slotted spoon . Cook for 8 minutes, then drain them and place them in a bowl with cold water . Peel them gently and set them aside.
After 30 minutes of cooking the red cabbage, let it cool slightly and strain the cooking liquid . Divide it into two bowls and in one of the two bowls pour the lemon juice and mix.
In this way one will become purple and the other will remain blue . Now immerse half of the eggs in the bowl with the purple water and half in the bowl with the blue water .
Leave the eggs to infuse for at least 3 hours, overnight would be even better. Once the minimum infusion time has passed, remove the colored eggs from the water , dry them, cut them in half, and season with salt and black pepper before serving .
We recommend consuming the eggs within 24 hours.
Use the colored eggs to prepare stuffed eggs! The red cabbage, after cooking, can be used for a velvety soup.
