instructions:
To prepare the pasta with zucchini and ham, first take care of the zucchini. After washing them, remove the ends and cut them into cubes . Finely chop the onion as well .
Cut the cooked ham into cubes and the scamorza cheese as well . Heat the vegetable broth .
Pour a drizzle of oil into a large, high-sided pan and add the onion , let it soften , then add the cooked ham and let it brown for a couple of minutes .
Add the zucchini and let them flavor for a few minutes, then salt and continue cooking . When the zucchini starts to dry, add a ladle of broth .
Continue cooking until the zucchini is soft; it will take another 10 minutes. Add the pasta and cook it as if it were risotto, adding a ladle of broth as needed : in this technique, the cooking time is longer than indicated on the package. When the pasta is cooked, turn off the heat and add the grated Grana cheese .
Add the diced provola cheese and stir until completely melted. Add a drizzle of raw oil and serve it .
We recommend consuming the pasta with zucchini and ham immediately. Alternatively, it can be stored for one day in the fridge and then heated before serving.
You can enrich the pasta with zucchini and ham with mushrooms and stronger cheeses.
