To temper milk chocolate, chop it , then melt the milk chocolate in a double boiler (it is preferable that the water in the saucepan does not touch the bottom of the bowl containing the chocolate; it is important that water does not get into the chocolate during the double boiler cooking); when the chocolate reaches a temperature of 113-122°F (measure with a kitchen thermometer) , pour 2/3 of it onto the marble slab placed on a worktop
and start spreading the chocolate on the marble slab with a spatula and a scraper , spreading it over the surface. When it reaches 81°F, transfer it to the bowl where you left the remaining 1/3 and mix. The chocolate should reach 84°F . If the temperature drops too much at this stage, always keep the double boiler with hot water on hand to slightly warm the chocolate. Conversely, if it's still too hot, repeat the spreading process on marble with a small part of the chocolate.
To temper dark chocolate, chop the chocolate , then melt it in a double boiler (it is preferable that the water in the saucepan does not touch the bottom of the bowl containing the chocolate; it is crucial that the boiling water does not come into contact with the chocolate); when the chocolate reaches a temperature of 129°F (measure with a kitchen thermometer) , pour 2/3 of it onto the marble slab placed on a worktop
and start spreading the chocolate on the marble slab, with a spatula and a scraper , spreading it over the surface . When it reaches 82°F (always measure with a kitchen thermometer) , transfer it to the bowl where you left the remaining 1/3 of the chocolate and mix : the chocolate should reach 88-90°F.

To temper white chocolate, chop it and melt it in a double boiler (2-3), remembering that it is preferable that the water in the saucepan does not touch the bottom of the bowl containing the chocolate; moreover, the water should not come into contact with the chocolate. White chocolate should reach a temperature of 113°F (measure with a kitchen thermometer);
then transfer 2/3 of the chocolate onto the marble surface and start spreading and smoothing it with a spatula and a scraper . The chocolate should reach a temperature of 79-81°F . Then, pour it into the bowl where you had left the remaining 1/3 of the melted chocolate and mix it to melt; measure the temperature which should be 81-82°F . If the temperature drops too much at this stage, always keep the double boiler with hot water on hand to slightly warm the chocolate. Conversely, if it's still too hot, repeat the spreading process on marble with a small part of the chocolate.
Once tempered, the chocolate should be used for preparations.
Always keep the water in the double boiler warm, so that you can warm the chocolate if the temperature drops too much.
You can melt all types of chocolate in the microwave in stages, always respecting the temperatures as indicated in the procedure.
