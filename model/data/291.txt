instructions:
To prepare the cauliflower and saffron pasta, first clean the cauliflower: remove the leaves and the central stalk , then separate the florets into smaller pieces . Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, add the cauliflower florets, and cook for 5 minutes .
In the meantime, heat a drizzle of oil in a pan, add the breadcrumbs , and toast them for a few minutes , until golden brown. Transfer the toasted breadcrumbs to a bowl and set aside .
In the same pan, dissolve the oil-packed anchovies , then add the raisins and pine nuts . After 5 minutes, drain the cauliflower florets into the pan , making sure to save the cooking water.
Add the saffron powder along with a ladle of cauliflower cooking water , stir to dissolve and blend it .
Cook the spaghetti in the same water used for cooking the cauliflower . When the pasta is al dente, drain it into the pan with the sauce and add a ladle of cooking water .
Mix and let the flavors meld for a minute . Serve the cauliflower and saffron pasta immediately , finishing the dishes with the toasted breadcrumbs !
It's recommended to enjoy the cauliflower and saffron pasta immediately. If necessary, you can store it in the fridge for one day in an airtight container.
For an even more flavorful variant, you can replace the anchovies with crumbled sausage or, for a vegetarian version, with chopped capers!
If you prefer a crunchier texture, toast the pine nuts together with the breadcrumbs.
Finally, for a fresh touch, try adding some grated lemon zest before serving!
