So, here's the deal with gluten-free bread : if you're after both taste and texture, you've gotta appreciate the Italian touch. Really, they know their stuff. In Italian kitchens, bakers have nailed the art of creating a soft, airy center with a crispy crust, all without using wheat. Which is great, right? This gluten-free bread recipe captures that magic, giving you bread that feels like you're stepping into a bakery in Rome or Florence—right from your own oven. You know, many folks think gluten-free bread ends up dense or crumbly, but those Italian techniques keep the dough moist and well-aerated. And listen, by tossing in seeds like flax, pumpkin, or sesame, you get a great crunch and nutty flavor that pretty much complements any meal perfectly.
It is a fantastic choice for anyone searching for celiac-friendly bread while still craving that fresh-baked aroma wafting through the kitchen. This bread is perfect for sandwiches, soaking up olive oil, or scooping up pasta sauce. Versatile, really. Making gluten-free bread at home doesn’t have to be intimidating. Italians have branched out from the classic loaf with variations like gluten-free walnut bread, focaccia and pizza—all keeping that tender and flavorful appeal. Creativity is encouraged; whether you sprinkle in some poppy seeds or try a new mix, it's part of the fun.
Honestly, while some might look for gluten-free bread near me in stores, making it at home avoids those long ingredient lists often found in gluten-free bread brands . Plus, you have complete control over what goes into your food. Italian families have been crafting these wheat-free loaves for generations—proving that golden, crusty bread can be enjoyed by all. The aroma and taste of this bread often have people reaching for another slice. Seriously good. It’s comfort food, Italian-style, offering all the flavor and texture you love, without gluten holding you back.

To prepare the gluten-free bread, crumble the fresh brewer's yeast into the bowl of the stand mixer , pour in a little warm water, taking it from the total amount indicated in the recipe , and stir with a spoon to dissolve it .
Pour in the gluten-free bread mix and gradually add the water with the yeast , continuing to mix with the hook , then add the remaining water as required.
Knead until you get a dense and homogeneous mixture, then pour in the extra virgin olive oil and add the salt . Continue kneading until the dough is elastic, then incorporate the seeds: first the pumpkin seeds (shelled) .
Then add the flax seeds . Work the dough again until it is soft, smooth, and slightly sticky . Transfer it to a surface lightly floured with the flour mix .
Work the dough to obtain a spherical shape , then place it in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap . Let it rise in a warm, sheltered place for about 2 hours, until the dough has doubled in volume . You can store it in the turned-off oven with the light on.
After the rising time, gently transfer the dough into a 8.5x4.5 inch pan, 2.5 inches high, perforated and lined with slightly damp parchment paper . Cover and let it rise for another 20 minutes at room temperature. Then, with a sharp blade, score the surface with a central cut (17–18) to help the bread develop in the oven. Preheat the oven in static mode to 482°F, then lower the temperature to 437°F and bake the bread for about 40 minutes. After baking, you will get a loaf of about 30 oz.
Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool . Once cool, slice it and enjoy it !
Store the gluten-free bread in a paper bag for 2-3 days. It is possible to freeze the bread even in slices.
If you don't have a perforated pan, you can use a regular loaf pan, and after the indicated time, continue baking without the pan at 266°F for 10 minutes to ensure even browning of the crust.
Try customizing the bread by adding other seeds like sunflower, sesame, or poppy: they will add crunchiness and a richer aroma. You can also lightly toast the seeds before incorporating them into the dough to enhance their flavor.
For gluten-free recipes, we recommend purchasing only products that have the crossed grain symbol on the package, certified gluten-free, recommended by the AIC Italian Celiac Association's handbook.
