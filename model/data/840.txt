instructions:
To prepare the grilled prawns, first rinse them under water for a few seconds, being careful not to break them , they must remain whole, then transfer them to a colander and let them drain . Heat a grill on the stove, as soon as it's scorching, place the prawns inside .
and let them cook over high heat for 3 minutes, then turn them over and continue cooking for another 3 minutes. In the meantime, prepare the dressing. In a small bowl, pour the oil, the lemon juice , and the chopped parsley .
Add the garlic cut into pieces and mix. Once cooked, salt the prawns. Use part of the dressing to brush the prawns , they will become shinier and more flavorful . Serve the grilled prawns with the remaining dressing.
We recommend consuming the grilled prawns immediately. If you have leftovers, you can keep them covered in the fridge for 1 day.
If you are using frozen prawns, let them thaw completely before cooking, the cooking times remain the same.
