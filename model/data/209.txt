instructions:
To prepare the nuggets in an air fryer, start by cleaning the chicken breast from bones and fat . Once cleaned, cut it into 1-inch pieces and place it in a mixer equipped with blades .
Add the bread crumbs and season with salt and sweet paprika .
Also add the onion powder and the garlic. Pour the extra virgin olive oil and close the mixer with its lid .
Blend everything until the mixture detaches from the sides and is homogeneous. With wet hands, take 0.7 ounces of the mixture , form balls and place them on a tray . With these doses, you will get 16 nuggets.
Roll each ball first in the semolina , making sure to remove the excess . Then dip it in the beaten eggs .
Roll it in the breadcrumbs , then give it the classic shape by molding it with your hands . Place the nuggets in the air fryer basket and pour the remaining extra virgin olive oil .
Cook for 14 minutes at 356°F, turning the nuggets halfway through cooking . After the cooking time, the air fryer nuggets will be golden and crispy , ready to be enjoyed !
We recommend consuming the air fryer nuggets immediately or freezing them after cooking. Alternatively, they can be stored for one day in the refrigerator, well covered.
If you don't have garlic and onion powder at home, you can replace them with a minced garlic clove and onion in the mixer. For a touch of extra freshness, serve your chicken nuggets with a sprinkle of fresh parsley and grated lemon zest.
