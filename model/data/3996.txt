To prepare the shakshuka, start by peeling the onion and finely chopping it , then wash the pepper, cut it in half , and remove the stem, seeds, and inner filaments .
Then begin slicing it until thin slices are obtained . Pour a drizzle of oil into a non-stick pan and heat it up .
Next, start to cook the chopped onion , let it soften on low heat , and add the peppers .
At this point, after giving it a stir , add a pinch of chili pepper and the tomato puree .
Pour in some water and then season with paprika and cumin .
Add the harissa , the salt , and stir again to flavor .
Now cover with the lid, continue cooking over low heat for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally . Now wash and chop a bunch of parsley (or cilantro) and set it aside, you will need it at the end of cooking .

All that remains is to pour the eggs one at a time , being careful not to break the yolks , cook them for about 3 or 4 minutes, at the end of cooking, the white should be white and the yolk very creamy. Adjust the salt .
Once the eggs are ready , add the freshly chopped parsley , turn off the heat, and serve the shakshuka hot .

It is recommended to prepare the recipe and serve it immediately, it does not adapt to any type of storage.
Depending on the season, you can prepare the recipe in the same way, but using fresh tomatoes instead of tomato puree.
If you want to enrich the recipe with cheese, the eggs prepared in this way pair perfectly with feta, which you can add at the end of cooking.
