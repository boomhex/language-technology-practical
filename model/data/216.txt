instructions:
To prepare peas in a pan, clean and finely chop the onion , pour and heat a drizzle of oil in a pan , add the chopped onion, and let it soften on a low flame for 2-3 minutes .
When the onion is soft , add the peas and adjust with salt .
Fragrance with fresh basil , pour about 3.5 tablespoons of water and set aside the rest: add it only if necessary. Cook the peas on a low flame, stirring occasionally for about 10-15 minutes. When about 5 minutes are left, add the cooked ham previously cut into cubes .

Finish cooking and turn off the heat . The peas are ready to be served; just bring them to the table .

Peas in a pan can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container or a bowl covered with plastic wrap.
You can freeze them after cooking if you have used fresh ingredients.

Peas in a pan can also be prepared with sweet or smoked bacon instead of cooked ham and, once ready, are perfect for filling an omelet, a casserole, or a savory pie.
