In southern Italy, they've nailed the art of flavor balance, so you get a perfect blend of the salty clam juices and that lemon hint from both zest and juice. The trick? Keep the clam pasta recipe simple, but focus on details: you want the pasta to soak up all those moist, sea-inspired flavors without being overwhelmed. And you know what?
