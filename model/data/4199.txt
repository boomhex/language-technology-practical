They are sweet, juicy, and there are at least 150 varieties to enjoy from June to October! We are talking about figs, sweet and juicy, perfect both as a fruit to end a meal and to serve with prosciutto. A winning combination that we have made even more refined with the recipe for ham rosettes on figs. A special finger food to serve for an aperitif where all the sweetness of caramelized figs encloses soft slices of prosciutto... a unique experience for the palate that we have also presented in a sandwich , replacing the prosciutto with speck! The secret of this simple dish? Undoubtedly fresh and quality ingredients, the success of the dish will be guaranteed!
To prepare the ham rosettes on figs, clean the figs with a soft, dry cloth on the outside and then cut them crosswise with a knife from the stem end, without cutting all the way through , but just enough to open them into 4 wedges . Place the opened figs on a baking sheet or tray and sprinkle the pulp with brown sugar ,
then place the figs on a baking tray and caramelize the surface for a few moments with a torch (if you don’t have a torch, you can put them under the oven grill for a few minutes until the sugar melts). In the meantime, take the slices of prosciutto which should not be too thin, otherwise, you won't be able to create the rosettes. Divide each slice into two equal parts and then roll each half onto itself
creating the rosettes this way . Place each rosette in the center of each fig (8-9) and serve this delicious appetizer immediately!
It is recommended to consume the preparation immediately and freezing is not advised.
I recommend preparing the ham and fig rosettes a few minutes before serving to avoid the ingredients spoiling. Choose a sweet prosciutto, perfect for this tasty dish!
