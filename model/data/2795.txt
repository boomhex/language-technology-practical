instructions:
To prepare the truffles, start by toasting the hazelnuts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , in a preheated static oven at 300°F for 30 minutes (265°F for 20 minutes if using a fan oven). In the meantime, melt the dark chocolate and gianduja in a bain-marie , stirring with a wooden spoon (the water in the saucepan should not touch the container in which you melt the chocolate). Once it has completely melted, also pour in the fresh liquid cream and continue stirring.
Add the Grand Marnier liqueur , stir again until you have a creamy, smooth, lump-free mixture. Then turn off the heat and transfer the mixture to a bowl; while it cools slightly, take the toasted hazelnuts and place them in a food processor to finely chop them .
Then add them to the chocolate mixture in the bowl and mix with a wooden spoon to combine the ingredients . Cover the mixture with plastic wrap and let it set in the refrigerator for 2-3 hours, until it is firm and compact.
At this point, take a teaspoon of the mixture at a time (about 1/3 oz) ; you can also use a melon baller for this operation. Shape the balls with your hands to give them a more regular shape . As you work them, place the balls on a tray , then put in the refrigerator to set for at least 1 hour.
Next, dust a tray with sifted bitter cocoa and roll the truffles in it to cover them thoroughly. Serve the truffles in small colorful paper cups !
You can store the truffles in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
You can vary the ingredients to decorate the truffles by rolling them in hazelnut crumbles, coconut, or white chocolate flakes instead of bitter cocoa!
