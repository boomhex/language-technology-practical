instructions:
To prepare the chocolate salami , first take the ingredients out of the refrigerator so that they are at room temperature. Chop the dark chocolate with a knife and melt it in the microwave or in a bain-marie , then let it cool. Meanwhile, pour the butter and sugar into a separate bowl and start working with a whip.
When you have reduced the butter to cream, pour the rum slowly while continuing to mix . Finally add the warm chocolate , give a quick stir and also add the unswetened cocoa powder, making sure to mix everything until you get a homogeneous mixture .
Crumble the dry biscuits with your hands and add them to the chocolate mixture , then mix with a spatula to incorporate them evenly .
Now take a sheet of baking paper and pour the mixture into the center, shaping it with your hands to give it a cylindrical shape . Lift the bottom flap and wrap the paper around the cylinder , then roll up the ends to seal it .
Transfer the roll to the refrigerator and let it harden for at least 2-3 hours . After this time, remove the baking paper and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Your chocolate salami is ready to be sliced and enjoyed !
The chocolate salami can be stored in the refrigerator for 5-6 days, closed in an airtight container. You can freeze it for a month at most; it is recommended to defrost it in the refrigerator and leave it at room temperature for an hour before cutting and serving it.
As an alternative to rum, you can flavor the dessert with another liqueur of your choice and for a non-alcoholic version you can use the same dose of orange juice.
