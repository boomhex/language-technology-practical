Start preparing the fettuccine with artichokes and shrimp tails by How to clean artichokes : remove the outermost and toughest leaves, making sure to keep the artichoke hearts soaking in water acidulated with lemon juice , cut off the pointed tips with thorns, then halve the artichokes and use a scoop to remove the central choke .
Then remove the outermost part of the stem using a peeler and cut the stem into pieces and the artichoke hearts into slices . Keep the artichoke pieces in the acidulated water .
Handle the shrimp: remove the head and shell , then gently extract the intestine using a toothpick , set the shrimp aside.
Peel the shallot and chop it finely , wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them into wedges . Now, in a pan, heat the olive oil, add the chopped shallot and let it soften over low heat for at least 5 minutes. If it dries out too much, add a tablespoon of fish stock or water.
When the shallot is softened , add the artichokes drained from the acidulated water , add a ladle of vegetable broth ,
add the cherry tomatoes , and the tomato puree , cook for 10 minutes over medium heat and occasionally pour another ladle of broth to prevent the sauce from drying out too much. Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil, salted to taste. Season with chopped parsley ,
then add the shrimp tails , sauté them for 5 minutes, then turn off the heat. Also add the fettuccine to the boiling water and cook them for about 5-6 minutes , then drain them ,
and pour them directly into the pan with the sauce . Sauté the fettuccine in the artichoke and shrimp tail sauce to flavor them, and then serve them hot .
It is preferable to consume the fettuccine with artichokes and shrimp tails immediately; if leftovers remain, you can store them in the refrigerator in an airtight container for one day. You can prepare the sauce in advance and store it in the fridge or freeze it if you used fresh ingredients.
You can opt for a “white” version by omitting the tomato puree; in this case, add broth during cooking or prepare a flavorful shellfish stock with shrimp shells.
