instructions:
To prepare ris and cabbage ravioli, start by pouring the flour onto the work surface, make a well, then pour the eggs in the center and start mixing. Continue by adding the oil and keep working with your hands. You will need to form a smooth and elastic dough. Once ready, make a ball, cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes. Finely chop celery, carrot, and onion (even better if you use a food processor), sauté for a few minutes in a pan with a drizzle of oil, stirring occasionally. Also finely chop the cabbage and add it to the pan. Stir occasionally and cook for 10 minutes. Add about 6.8 ounces of milk from the total amount, stir and then cover with the lid, cook for about 1 hour. In a large pot pour water, salt to taste, also add 17 ounces of milk and bring to a boil. Cook the rice for 18-20 minutes from when it returns to a boil (check cooking, then drain and let cool).
Once the pasta has rested, you can divide it into 2 parts, passing one piece at a time through the pasta machine to create a very thin strip of dough. Combine the cold rice and the cooked and cooled cabbage with the filling and make small piles about 1.5 inches apart from each other. Brush the dough where there is no filling with water, so that the dough you will place on top sticks more easily, always very thin. Gently press with your fingers where there is no filling before passing the fluted pasta cutter to get your rather large square-shaped ravioli.
You can cook them for about 90 seconds in salted boiling water to taste, then sauté them in a pan with melted butter, cooked until it becomes nutty! Enjoy your meal!
The ravioli can be frozen, spaced out on a tray, and once they harden, they can be transferred to a bag.
They should be cooked frozen, for 3-4 minutes in boiling water.

The scraps can be kneaded again or can be cooked as maltagliati!
Corn oil can be used instead of olive oil for the dough.

Surrounded by greenery in a small mountain village, it is the perfect place for a peaceful and relaxing stay, away from the hectic city life. The old elementary school has been renovated and transformed into the agriturismo's restaurant. Inside the building, you can still find some objects from the old school. The kitchen offers traditional dishes using raw materials from our garden and other small local farms. The ancient mill houses two rooms inside, one was once used for rye milling. Today it is still possible to admire the old grinding gears placed under the glass floor.
