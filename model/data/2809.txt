When spring rolls into Italy, there's really nothing like a crostata rustica to kick off the season. This isn’t just any old savory tart; it’s a true crostata salata italiana . Picture this: tender green peas, zucchini slices, and crisp asparagus all wrapped up in a buttery, golden crust. Seriously good stuff. Plus, what makes this brisée pastry stand out is the grated cheese mixed right into the dough—giving every bite an extra savory kick.
You'll see it at family gatherings, for sure, cut into neat little cubes. It’s kinda like a clever way to showcase the season’s best veggies. Italians just love keeping it rustic and simple, so the fresh flavors can really, really shine. Every bite has that nostalgic, country vibe—it's like a little taste of how folks across Italy have enjoyed it for generations.
So, here's the deal: serving a ricetta crostata rustica makes for a tasty spring lunch or even a standout buffet dish. The filling? Creamy ricotta with a hint of nutmeg, offering a moist and almost creamy texture. Pairs perfectly, I gotta say, with the slight crunch from the veggies. It's super, super popular for a reason. The crostata rustica verdure balances light and rich flavors beautifully.
And look, while there are endless versions across Italy—some with spinach or artichokes, depending on what's local—the core idea stays the same. Keep it simple and fresh. Let those flavors shine. This crostata rustica facile is not fussy at all, yet it looks amazing on a table. Trust me, it vanishes quickly once people start tasting it.
For anyone after a classic ricetta tradizionale italiana , this dish is a total crowd-pleaser. Those crispy edges coming out of the oven—yeah, they fill your kitchen with an aroma that's super hard to resist. It’s the perfect way to savor a bit of Italy at home, bringing everyone together over something delicious. Really, can't go wrong.
To make the rustic Italian pie, start by preparing the shortcrust pastry: To prepare the shortcrust pastry, put the sifted flour, cold butter from the fridge cut into pieces, a pinch of salt in a blender, and blend everything until you get a sandy and floury mixture . Place the obtained mixture on a work surface in the classic fountain shape, add the grated Parmesan in the center , and gradually pour in the ice-cold water
and knead vigorously until you get a compact, firm, and fairly elastic dough . Once ready, wrap your shortcrust pastry in a sheet of plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 40 minutes. In the meantime, prepare the filling: clean the asparagus, trim them with a knife by removing the tougher part and peel the stalks with a vegetable peeler to remove the outer fibrous part. Then boil them in the special asparagus pot , leaving the tips out.
Once they are cooked, cut them into rounds taking care to keep the tips whole (they will be used for garnishing). Wash, peel, and dice the carrots and zucchini .
In a large pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil , add the diced carrots , a whole clove of garlic, the peas, diced zucchini and sauté the vegetables for a few minutes: they should remain crunchy and not fall apart.
Then turn off the heat and incorporate the asparagus , add salt, pepper, and season the vegetables with basil leaves. Sift the ricotta in a sieve and collect it in a small bowl, flavor with nutmeg, add the grated Parmesan ,
pour the milk and mix the cheese mixture to obtain a smooth and soft cream. At this point, add the sautéed vegetables to the mixture , slice the black olives into rounds
and add them to the filling along with the basil leaves , mixing with a spatula. Finally, take the Fontal cheese , cut it into cubes
and add it to the filling . Set the filling aside and take the shortcrust pastry: remove the plastic wrap and roll it out on a floured work surface into a round sheet about 1/4 inch thick . Wrap the sheet around the rolling pin and unroll it on an 11-inch diameter pan. Trim the border with a smooth cutter removing the excess dough (which you can re-knead to make the lattice strips).
Pierce the bottom of the pastry with a fork , so it won't puff up too much during baking. Then cut a parchment paper disc the diameter of the pan, wet it, squeeze it, and place it on the pastry. Cover the base with dried legumes or specific weights for blind baking . Bake the shortcrust pastry in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 30 minutes (if fan-assisted, at 320°F for 20 minutes). Remove the pan from the oven , take out the weights and parchment paper
and then fill it with the vegetable and cheese filling . Roll out the leftover shortcrust pastry and cut strips with a fluted pastry wheel and apply them over the surface, intersecting them diagonally, like a classic sweet pie .
Finally, decorate the edge with a strip of dough the same length as the perimeter of the pan, twisted into a helix shape . Brush the surface with a beaten egg and bake again at 350°F for 70 minutes (if fan-assisted, at 320°F for 60 minutes). Once cooked, remove the pie from the oven, garnish it with the asparagus tips , and serve it at the table!
You can store the rustic Italian pie in the refrigerator for 3 days. You can freeze it in portions to thaw more easily. It is possible to freeze the shortcrust pastry dough separately.
The rustic pie is good all year round, choose seasonal vegetables to create tasty and flavorful variations: mushrooms, artichokes, tomatoes, eggplants, and if you want to add a flavorful touch, also add diced cooked ham.
