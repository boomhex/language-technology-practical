instructions:
To prepare the tandoori pork shank, score the meat lengthwise by making 5-6 cuts on each shank to allow the marinade to penetrate well . Remove any skin residues and excessive fat clumps with a knife . Peel a garlic clove and remove the germ .
Place the garlic in a blender , add the ginger and the chili peppers ,
then add a small cup of water (about 1 oz) and blend . Transfer to a bowl and add the yogurt, the juice of half a lemon ,
paprika , garam masala, and cumin . Mix everything well ,
until you get a smooth sauce . Brush the yogurt sauce over the entire surface of the meat , cover and place in the refrigerator for at least 5 hours, preferably overnight. Keep the remaining marinade.
Before baking the meat, brush it again with the marinade. Cook in a static oven at 320°F in the central part of the oven for at least three hours, turning and brushing the meat with ghee and the leftover sauce from time to time .
Continuing to brush with ghee , the meat will become very tender. Once cooked, remove from the oven and serve .
It is recommended to consume the shank as soon as it is cooked. Alternatively, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.
The tandoori pork shank is excellent when served with plain basmati rice.
