instructions:
To make the coconut and limoncello muffins, start by sifting the flour together with the baking powder and baking soda in a bowl. Add to the mixture 2.8 oz of desiccated coconut and the salt. In the bowl of a stand mixer or with an electric mixer, whip the butter with the sugar until creamy. Add the eggs one at a time , continuing to whip, making sure to incorporate each egg well before adding the next.
Now add the milk slowly , also pour in the limoncello ; when it has been absorbed into the mixture, gradually add the previously sifted dry ingredients .
Flavor with lemon zest . Continue whipping the mixture until it reaches a smooth and homogeneous consistency. When the batter is ready, transfer it into a piping bag without a nozzle or with a plain nozzle . Prepare a muffin tin with paper liners: fill the liners with the muffin batter, leaving a few millimeters of space from the edge
and sprinkle the surface with the remaining desiccated coconut (13-14). With the indicated amounts, you will get 18 muffins. Bake them in a static oven preheated to 356°F for 25 minutes (or in a fan oven at 320°F for about 15-20 minutes). Once baking is complete, remove the coconut and limoncello muffins from the oven and let them cool before enjoying them.
You can store the coconut and limoncello muffins under a glass dome or in a tin box for 4-5 days. It is possible to freeze the muffins and thaw them at room temperature when needed.
You can accompany the muffins by serving them with lemon-flavored chantilly cream.
