Now peel the oranges: place them on a cutting board and with a knife, remove the top and bottom ends. Set the orange on the bottom end and with the knife, cut away both the peel and the bitter white part , then slice between each segment to separate them, thus obtaining slices without the white skin covering the segments . Now attend to the How to clean shrimp : remove the legs and shell , cut into the tail end, and finally cut along the back of the shrimp with a small knife and gently extract the intestine.
Place the cleaned shrimp in a bowl, add the olive oil , thyme leaves , salt, pepper, and flavor with lemon zest . Mix to season the shrimp, cover with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

incorporate the Greek yogurt and mix to emulsify the sauce , salt, and pepper to taste. Everything is ready to assemble the salad. Arrange the washed and gently dried baby spinach leaves on a serving platter, place the julienned cabbage in the center ,
arrange the peeled orange slices in a circle on the edge and place a few walnut halves between the segments , distribute the shrimp over the salad, and finally, dress with the sauce , also to be served on the side. The shrimp salad with yogurt sauce is ready to be enjoyed!
