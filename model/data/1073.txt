instructions:
To prepare the savory bell pepper tart, first cut the peppers in half, remove the seeds and the stalk, then cut them into regular rectangles about 1.5x3.5 inches. Place the peppers on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , add salt ,
add pepper , and drizzle with a little olive oil, then bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 25 minutes. Once cooked, remove the peppers from the oven and let them cool. Wash and trim the zucchini, then slice them thinly with a mandolin . Slice the scamorza cheese and then cut it into strips.
Assemble the rolls: lay a bell pepper slice on a cutting board, place a zucchini slice on top , and finally add a strip of scamorza cheese at one end. Roll up the peppers and set them aside.
Butter and flour a 6-inch diameter pan, lay the brisée pastry over it, and press it well onto the bottom and sides. Prick the bottom with a fork . Place the peppers in the pan . Wash and slice the Piccadilly tomatoes .
Then place them in the empty spaces between the rolls . Drizzle with olive oil , oregano, and pepper, and bake for 60 minutes in a preheated static oven at 356°F. Once ready, remove the savory bell pepper tart from the oven and enjoy it hot or warm .
Store the savory bell pepper tart in the fridge for a couple of days. You can freeze it after baking.
You can use puff pastry instead of brisée. For the filling, you can use other cheeses like caciocavallo or fontina.
