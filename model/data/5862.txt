instructions:
Saltimbocca alla Romana , literally translated as 'jump in the mouth', is a typical Italian meat-based main course of Roman cuisine. These are veal slices enveloped in raw ham and sage leaves, cooked briefly in a pan with a splash of white wine. A quick and tasty recipe that jumps in your mouth, as the name suggests. In the traditional recipe, veal slices are typically used. However, in today's version, we will substitute them with chicken and enhance the dish's appeal by adding cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil leaves. This creates a delightful fusion of flavors, reminiscent of both the famous Caprese Salad and Saltimbocca alla Romana . Incredibly easy and quick to prepare , Caprese Chicken Saltimbocca is the perfect choice for a delicious and hassle-free dinner with family or friends, ensuring a guaranteed success.

Arrange chicken slices on a cutting board and place a piece of raw ham on each slice (slightly smaller than the meat). Add a fresh sage leaf to the center, then secure the meat and ham together with a toothpick.
Sprinkle some flour on a plate, coat the chicken slices with flour on the side without the filling, and remove any excess.
In a large pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil over low heat.
Once the butter has melted, add the chicken slices and increase the temperature to brown the saltimbocca.
Season with pepper, avoiding additional salt since the raw ham already provides saltiness.
Once it begins to fry, incorporate white wine and allow it to evaporate for 1 minute on medium-high heat.
Remove the chicken saltimbocca and place it on a plate.
Introduce a teaspoon of butter to the pan and melt it over medium-low heat, allowing the sauce to thicken into a creamy consistency (a few seconds will suffice).
Cut cherry tomatoes and small mozzarella into wedges. Season them in a bowl with 3 tablespoons of olive oil, a splash of balsamic vinegar, and a pinch of salt. Allow them to marinate for a few minutes.
Transfer the chicken saltimbocca to a serving dish and add the tomatoes, mozzarella, and a handful of basil leaves. Drizzle the cooking sauce over the top.
Serve the caprese chicken saltimbocca immediately while it's still hot.
Caprese chicken saltimbocca is best enjoyed fresh. It can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 day. Reheat in the oven or microwave.

Chicken : For a perfect caprese chicken saltimbocca, use high-quality organic chicken breast. Slice it into teardrop-shaped thin slices, thicker at the top and thinner at the end, using a sharp knife.
Mozzarella : Opt for whole milk mozzarella balls for enhanced taste. If unavailable or short on time, packaged mozzarella pieces can also be used.
Tomatoes : Garnish your caprese chicken saltimbocca with cherry tomatoes. To elevate their flavor, we recommend marinating them.
Prosciutto crudo : Opt for a delicately seasoned raw ham.
