instructions:
To prepare the ham croquettes, finely chop an onion . Melt the butter in a saucepan and stew the onion for 10 minutes over medium-low heat .
Meanwhile, cut the ham into strips , add it to the pan , and cook for 1 minute. Add the flour all at once and toast it for 2 minutes.
Pour in the milk in three additions and flavor with nutmeg . You need to obtain a very thick béchamel, which will take at least 6 minutes .
Once you have obtained a thick consistency, transfer the mixture into a baking dish , let it cool at room temperature, and refrigerate to firm up for at least 2 hours. Take the mixture out of the fridge and invert onto a cutting board .
With a knife, cut out 10 equal rectangles . Shape them into croquettes by molding them with damp hands. Dip the croquettes first in beaten eggs
and then in breadcrumbs . As you bread them, place them on a tray . Heat the seed oil and bring it to 340°F. Fry the croquettes for 3 minutes, a maximum of 2 at a time .
Drain them when they are golden and let them dry on absorbent paper . Immediately serve the ham croquettes .
We recommend consuming the ham croquettes immediately.
Serve the croquettes with Mashed potatoes or a pea cream if you want to serve them as a main course, or prepare a quick sauce with Greek yogurt, oil, salt, and chives to dip them in if you prefer to enjoy them as an appetizer!
