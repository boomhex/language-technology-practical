The French term "champignon" means mushroom and in Italy, it refers to the most widespread and easy-to-prepare variety, cultivated all year round and also known as "button mushroom" or "Paris mushroom". When purchasing, always pay attention to the integrity of the champignons, choosing those with firm, white flesh, free of stains or holes on the cap.
