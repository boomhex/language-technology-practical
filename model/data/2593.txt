Capesante su letto di cipolle caramellate with carote and peperoni alla soia is all about mixing the fresh taste of seafood with something a little unexpected. Here, the capesante (scallops) are the stars, but what really makes this dish different is how the salsa di soia mingles with the natural tender sweetness of the onions and the bright, crisp snap of the peppers and carrots. It's like tasting the sea with an Asian twist—kind of unusual for Italian seafood. And you know what? People usually think of their capesante with a squeeze of lemon or breadcrumbs, but this one hits you with a tangy surprise thanks to that soy sauce. It's a fusion thing. Quick and easy, for real. Plus, you can really really taste each ingredient since nothing’s overdone or masked.
In many places where folks enjoy seafood and Asian-inspired sauces, this dish totally fits the bill. You get the best of both worlds: the moist, delicate molluschi and those caramelized onions that are just so so sweet. The peppers and carrots keep everything colorful and add a crunch you don’t always get in classic antipasto di mare or other Italian seafood starters. And the aroma? The salsa di soia sizzling in the pan wakes up the whole dish. It's way way lighter than capesante al forno or capesante gratinate , with that Asian edge that's just right for a quick, flavorful meal. Whether it’s a second course or a fancy starter, this dish gets people talking—because it’s not your everyday seafood dish, and it really brings out the best in every simple ingredient.
Perfect for anyone who appreciates a creative twist on traditional flavors, this recipe is especially great for gatherings where you want to impress without being stuck in the kitchen all day. The unique combination of capesante with soy sauce-infused vegetables offers a balance that’s both satisfying and visually appealing—an ideal choice for any occasion. Seriously good.
To prepare scallops on a bed of caramelized onions with soy carrots and peppers, start with the vegetable bed: take the red and yellow peppers, open them to remove the internal seeds, then cut them into strips, all of the same size if possible (1-2). Clean and thinly slice an onion, again preferably in slices of the same size .
Then cut off part of the green tops of the baby carrots, peel them with a vegetable peeler, and cut them in half ; in a pan, pour the oil, heat it, then add the onions, peppers, and carrots and sauté over medium heat for 7-8 minutes. The vegetables should remain crunchy. Then add the sugar and caramelize, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon.
Finally, add the soy sauce , let it evaporate, and turn off the heat. In another pan, pour a drizzle of oil and sear the scallops removed from their shells . Brown them for 3-4 minutes over high heat, turning them with a fork .
At this point, plate as you prefer; for example, you could use a round pastry cutter placed on the individual serving plate and pour in the vegetables first to create a nest shape, then place the scallops and garnish with a sprig of thyme . Serve the scallops on a bed of caramelized onions with soy carrots and peppers hot !
Store the scallops on a bed of caramelized onions with soy carrots and peppers in the refrigerator for 1 day in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
Avoid prolonged cooking of the scallops to prevent the meat from becoming rubbery.
