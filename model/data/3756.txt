Colorful platters of Lovers' Cookies promise a crowd-pleasing treat for any gathering, family night, or festive event. These easy cookie recipes bring everyone together with an inviting mix of chewy chocolate chip cookies dotted with rich chocolate and beautifully soft sugar cookies that work for every celebration or holiday baking moment. From the pretty look of sprinkles on classic sugar cookies to the gooey centers that come out with each bite of chocolate chip cookies , there’s a happy buzz around the kitchen table whenever these appear. People often love how these homemade cookies combine familiar flavors with simple, joyful sweetness—whether it’s a generous stack for an after-school snack, a fun base for making cookie sandwiches, or a pretty tray for neighborhood parties (kids and adults can never pick just one!).
Since easy cookie recipes offer both endless flavor options and that guaranteed homey feeling, busy families appreciate the flexibility. A classic peanut butter cookie or moist oatmeal round hits the spot when you want something hearty, while no bake cookies give you a way to satisfy quick dessert cravings or whip up treats for last-minute playdates. The best part—there’s a cookie for just about every taste or need, since the collection goes from traditional to creative with plenty of allergy-friendly ideas (think vegan or gluten-free choices). Boxes of these cookies—especially when filled with chewy, nice , buttery types—make thoughtful homemade gifts. Home cooks reach for homemade cookies and these quick desserts again and again because they’re simple, adaptable, and everyone leaves happy...that’s a WIN for any dessert table. Whether stacked high for holidays or shared straight from the container on a regular Saturday, Lovers’ Cookies make every day a little more DELICIOUS while keeping family traditions alive with warmth and great taste.
Cut the butter into cubes and, using the beaters of a mixer or a food processor, mix it with the sugar and grated lemon zest until you get a nice smooth cream.
Add the eggs to the cream (1 whole + 1 yolk), one at a time and, without overbeating, add the salt and finally the sifted flour with baking powder . Mix well and transfer the dough to the work surface , where you will work it until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough .
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for half an hour. After the necessary time, take the dough, roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured work surface until you get a sheet about 1/6 inch thick; with cutters, cut out the alphabet letters that form the words "I love you", but also "Valentine's Day", "love" and all the words that come to mind and could be suitable for the occasion, such as your partner's name. With heart-shaped cutters, cut out both classic cookies and those to be placed on the rim of cups ; if you don't have the appropriate cutter, remove a small rectangle of dough with a smooth-bladed knife as shown in the picture.
Line several baking sheets with parchment paper and arrange the cookies on them, spacing them a few inches apart . Bake in a preheated oven at 338°F for about 15 minutes. Once baked, sprinkle the letters with powdered sugar and prepare the colored glaze to cover the hearts with powdered sugar, coloring, and hot water . Mix everything well with a spoon .
To spread the glaze, which should be smooth and thick like glue, help yourself with a brush or a teaspoon . If desired, you can also prepare white glaze to create writings or color contrasts .
Another idea could be to fill two heart-shaped cutouts with strawberry jam. Take the whole cutout and spread it with jam , cover it with the other cutout and then fill the central hole with more jam .
If you want to make nice writings on the cookies, as an alternative to the glaze described above, you can beat an egg white until stiff and incorporate as much powdered sugar as needed to make the mixture very thick (at least 6-7 tablespoons). Put everything in a piping bag with a tiny nozzle (or make a cone with wax paper or baking paper) and write the message you like best.
