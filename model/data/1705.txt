To prepare almond milk, first soak the almonds in a bowl with 2 cups of water for at least an hour . After this time, pour both the almonds and the water into a blender with steel blades , then add the remaining 2 cups of water .
and the honey . Blend everything until you get a smooth cream , then strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve .
Mix well with a teaspoon to separate the liquid part from the solid part (7-8), then place the bowl where you collected the liquid in the refrigerator for at least an hour, covered with film. Serve your almond milk cold or at room temperature !
Almond milk can be stored for 4 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container. Shake it well before consuming. If you prefer, you can leave the almonds to soak overnight.
If you wish, you can flavor the almond milk by adding the seeds from a vanilla pod or a cinnamon stick to the soaking water, or you can replace the acacia honey with orange or linden honey for a more pronounced flavor. If you want to use almond milk to make a vegan recipe, you can replace the honey with the same amount of maple syrup or about 1/2 cup of sugar.
