instructions:
To prepare the gluten-free Easter pie, first start with the shortcrust pastry: in a food processor, pour in the gluten-free flour mix, the cold butter , and a pinch of salt . Turn on the mixer and slowly pour in cold water .
When the water is well absorbed , transfer the dough to the work surface . Knead lightly with your hands just enough to compact it into a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator while you prepare the filling.
Peel and finely chop the onion . In a large pan, heat a drizzle of oil, then add the chopped onion and stew over medium-low heat for about 8-10 minutes, adding a little water .
Now add the chard and cook for a few minutes, just enough to soften them . Drain the chard to remove excess liquid and let cool.
When the chard has cooled, transfer it to a bowl with the egg , grated cheese , and a pinch of salt. Separately, mix the ricotta, which you have drained in a sieve if necessary, with the eggs .
Season with grated cheese , nutmeg , and salt. Mix everything and set aside. At this point, take the dough from the fridge and roll it out with a rolling pin, dusting with a little gluten-free flour .
Form a disc with a diameter of about 12 inches and roll the sheet onto the rolling pin. Unroll the sheet over a flared tin that measures 8 inches at the base and 9.5 inches at the rim, about 2 inches high . Pass the rolling pin over the rim to cut off the excess dough , which will need to be worked and rolled out again for the top layer.
Now pour the chard filling into the tin and level it well with the back of a spoon , then add the ricotta filling .
Level here too to have a smooth surface . Make 7 depressions with a spoon , shell the eggs separately and gently place them in these spaces , being careful not to break them.
Roll out the rest of the shortcrust pastry, place it over the tin, and seal the edges . With the tip of a knife, make holes across the surface to let air escape during baking . Finally, brush the surface with the mixed egg yolk and cream .
Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F on the lowest rack (not touching the base of the oven) for 70 minutes . Remove from the oven and let your gluten-free Easter pie cool before cutting and serving it !
The gluten-free Easter pie can be stored for 2-3 days in the fridge.
It can be frozen after baking, already portioned.
The chard can be replaced with spinach.
If you like, you can use sheep's ricotta, which has a more intense and strong flavor.
For gluten-free recipes, we recommend purchasing only products that display the crossed-out spike on the packaging, certified gluten-free, recommended by the AIC Italian Celiac Association guidebook.
