instructions:
To prepare the ricotta and artichoke flans recipe, first clean the vegetables thoroughly: remove the outer leaves , then cut off the toughest tips, quarter them, and remove the inner choke . Boil the artichokes in plenty of salted water for about 10 minutes from boiling , they should be tender.
Drain them and transfer them to a bowl with cold water to stop the cooking. At this point, drain the artichokes and dry them with a cloth , then place them in a tall glass .
Add the sheep ricotta and blend everything well with an immersion blender . Pour the cream into a bowl .


Incorporate 80 g of grated cheese and the eggs , season with salt and pepper, and mix to combine the dough. Take 4 individual molds about 3 inches in diameter, grease the bottom and the edge with oil .


Coat with breadcrumbs , then fill them with the artichoke cream and sprinkle the surface with breadcrumbs .
Finish by sprinkling the remaining cheese on top . Bake in a preheated static oven at 375°F for 30 minutes or until well browned. Unmold the ricotta and artichoke flans and serve them warm .
The ricotta and artichoke flans can be stored in the fridge for a couple of days. You can freeze them after cooking.
Serve the flans with a Parmigiano Cream to make them even more enticing!
