instructions:
To prepare the yogurt four-quarters loaf cake, first pour the eggs into a bowl. Add the brown sugar and vanilla extract .
Beat with an electric mixer until the eggs are light, fluffy, and frothy . Then add the room temperature yogurt and mix again with the beaters .
Add the previously sifted flour and also the sifted baking powder . Stir with a spatula from the bottom up to incorporate the powders without deflating the batter.
Place the blueberries in a bowl and flour them . Add them to the batter and mix with a spatula .
Transfer the batter to an 8.5x3.5 inches loaf pan, previously greased and lined with parchment paper . Using a greased scraper, gently make a line in the center of the loaf ; this step is optional and only serves to achieve a more precise shape once baked. Bake in a preheated static oven at 365°F for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 330°F and bake for another 25 minutes. Always do the toothpick test before taking the loaf cake out of the oven .
Let it cool, then remove the loaf cake from the mold and sprinkle it with powdered sugar . Slice it and serve the yogurt four-quarters loaf cake accompanied by blueberry yogurt, fresh blueberries, and mint leaves !
The yogurt four-quarters loaf cake keeps at room temperature for 2-3 days.
Instead of blueberries, you can use raspberries, strawberries, or apple slices. Customize it by adding chocolate chips!
