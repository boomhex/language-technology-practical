In India, naan is like a must-have side for all those saucy dishes. This homemade naan with yogurt? It's a clever twist on the classic. I mean, instead of tossing that nearly expired yogurt, you can use it to whip up some soft, tender flatbread. Really, really good stuff.
This idea is catching on for folks who want to cut down on food waste while making something moist and golden at the table. Crazy how just a touch of yogurt can transform bread, right? It makes it fluffy and adds this slight tangy note that just pairs perfectly with Indian cuisine. And you know what? Some even call this a smart, eco-friendly version of the naan with yogurt you might find in restaurants, but it has that practical, home-cooked vibe.
And listen, in many kitchens, using up leftovers is essential. This no-fuss naan? Pretty much fits right in with other no-waste recipes. No yeast in this easy naan bread recipe , which means no waiting for dough to rise. Just mix, roll and cook. People who make Greek yogurt naan at home say it is soft inside and gets a hint of crispy edges if you get the pan nice and hot. Super tasty.
It's a great option for making the most of ingredients nearing expiration, creating a super versatile bread that works as an appetizer with dips or as a side for curry. Stovetop naan like this isn't just tasty; it's a feel-good way to keep food waste low and flavor high. Pretty simple.

It's all about getting creative with what you have and still putting out something pretty awesome on the table.

To make the yogurt naan bread, pour the flour into a bowl, then add the yeast , the plain yogurt , and the water .
Add the salt and mix everything with a spoon, then transfer the dough onto your work surface and knead by hand until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough . Let the dough rest in the bowl, covered with plastic wrap, for about an hour .
After this time, divide the dough into 6 portions , form balls , and roll them out with a rolling pin to form disks approximately 1/8 inch thick . If the dough tends to retract, let the disks rest for a couple of minutes and roll them out again, also using your hands.
Cook the naans in a non-stick pan over high heat for about 3-4 minutes on the first side and 2 minutes on the other side, or until golden brown . Serve your yogurt naan bread while still warm !
The yogurt naan bread can be stored for one day at room temperature.
You can freeze it after cooking.
If you wish, you can flavor the dough with a pinch of turmeric.
