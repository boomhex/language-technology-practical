instructions:
To prepare lomo saltado, first bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the rice that will serve as the accompaniment . While the rice is cooking, cut the beef filet first into slices and then into fairly large pieces .
Transfer the meat to a container, season with cumin and a pinch of salt, and set aside while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. Split the aji amarillo lengthwise , remove the seeds inside, and cut it into strips .
Peel and cut the onion into thick slices . Slice the tomatoes and cut the green part of the scallion into chunks .
Coarsely chop the cilantro . Finally, peel and cut the potatoes into wedges and fry them in hot vegetable oil .
In a wok or non-stick pan, sear the meat with a drizzle of oil over very high heat for about 5 minutes to give it a quick cooking , then set it aside . In the same pan, add the onions .
Add the tomatoes and the aji amarillo . Stir-fry everything for a few minutes, always over high heat, then add the seared meat .
First deglaze with vinegar and then with soy sauce , and continue to stir-fry everything for another 7 minutes, stirring often. Finally, add the scallion .
Season with cilantro and mix well . Your lomo saltado is ready to be served with rice and french fries !
Lomo saltado can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
Aji amarillo can be found in ethnic food stores; alternatively, you can replace it with a yellow bell pepper and a pinch of chili pepper!
The best cut of meat for lomo saltado is filet or sirloin; if preferred, you can also use rump steak.
