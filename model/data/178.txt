instructions:
To prepare the fig and walnut semifreddo, first peel the figs and then cut them into slices and then into cubes .
Set the figs aside for a moment and coarsely chop the walnuts with a knife . Now pour the ricotta into a bowl .
Add the sugar and cold heavy cream , then work with electric beaters . You should get a semi-whipped consistency. Now add the figs .
Also add the crumbled walnuts , the seeds you have removed from the vanilla pod , and mix everything with a spatula .
Transfer the mixture into the appropriate molds with the help of a spoon . We used a silicone mold for 6 desserts with a capacity of approximately 2.6 oz each, with a diameter of about 3 inches and about 1.6 inches high. Level the surface well and freeze for at least 6 hours . When you are ready to serve them, remove the semifreddos from the molds .
Transfer to the serving dish , decorate with fig slices and a mint leaf , wait a few minutes, and serve your fig and walnut semifreddo !
You can store the fig and walnut semifreddo in the freezer, wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to one month.
To enhance the texture and flavor, choose figs that are well-ripened but still firm. Instead of walnuts, you can use almonds.
