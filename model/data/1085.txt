instructions:
To prepare chocolate breadsticks, start with the dough. Break the brewer's yeast and dissolve it in 2 tablespoons of milk taken from the total quantity . Pour the flour into a bowl .
Pour the milk in which you dissolved the yeast into the center. Stir with a spoon, then gradually add the remaining milk . Finally, pour in the oil . Stir and also add the sugar .
Add the fine salt , work quickly, then transfer to a surface and knead for about 10 minutes .
Flatten the dough a bit , add the chocolate chips and knead until they are well combined .
Flatten the dough again with your hands and form a rectangle about 3/4 inch thick . Transfer the dough to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper .
and brush it with 1 1/2 tablespoons of milk ; finally sprinkle with granulated sugar . Let the dough rise for 2 hours .
After the rising time, gently flip the dough onto a floured board and carefully remove the parchment paper. With a smooth-bladed cutter, cut strips of dough about 3/4 inch wide .
Gently stretch each strip by hand to the desired length, about 12 inches . Arrange the breadsticks on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them slightly apart. Brush the breadsticks with milk and sprinkle with sugar .
Let rise again for 1 hour . Bake in a preheated ventilated oven at 356°F for about 20 minutes. Remove the breadsticks and let them cool completely on a rack before serving .
The breadsticks remain crunchy if stored in a tin box for a week. Freezing is not recommended.
For a more rustic result, use brown sugar instead of granulated sugar!
