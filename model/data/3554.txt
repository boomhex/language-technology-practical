Prepare the hazelnut shortcrust pastry by finely grinding the hazelnuts with a tablespoon of sugar in a mixer until you get a fine powder ; add this powder to the flour in the stand mixer.
Then add the sugar and the cold butter diced; mix quickly until you get a crumbly mixture, at this point add the whole egg and the yolk; form a dough ball , cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
Take the ball of pastry, roll it out into a rectangular sheet about 1/8 inch thick and cut it with the cookie cutter (8-9) in a pumpkin shape;
place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a preheated fan oven at 355°F for about 12-14 minutes until they are golden on the surface. In the meantime, prepare the glaze by adding powdered sugar and a little boiling water at a time to a bowl until you get a fairly thick cream , (you can adjust the consistency of the glaze by adding either more powdered sugar or water as needed) Divide the neutral glaze obtained into two bowls, in a smaller one add the green coloring that you will use for the pumpkin's stem and veins; in a larger bowl (the same one you used to prepare the white glaze is fine), add the orange coloring that will be used as the base for the pumpkin itself.
Set aside the two glazes and stir them occasionally to prevent the sugar from crystallizing. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack ; when the cookies are well cooled, drop a teaspoon of orange glaze onto the pumpkin and spread it with the back of the teaspoon;
wait for it to set and then spread the green glaze on the stem and then create the pumpkin's stripes with a small cone made of parchment paper or a simple syringe. Let the glazes solidify well before serving the cookies.
Food colorings are available on the market in liquid, powder, or gel/paste form. The most common are the liquid ones, which affect the consistency of the glaze, so in this case, less water should be used. The best colorings in terms of shade rendering are the powder ones; being very strong, a minimal amount should be used. Just like classic tempera paints, it's possible to mix food colorings to obtain colors according to your taste or needs, for example, in this case, if you can't find ready-made orange, you can create it by combining red and yellow until you find the shade of orange you like best.
