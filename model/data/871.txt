Gnocchi with scorpionfish ragu is one of those dishes that really leaves an impression. It's perfect for the holidays or anytime you’re craving something special. Hailing from Tuscany's beautiful coast, it features semolina gnocchi as its base. Really, it's like a tender, melt-in-your-mouth experience with every bite.
But the star? It's the scorpionfish ragu —don't let the fish's look scare you off! Scorfano, or scorpionfish, has firm, moist meat that works wonders in sauces and stews. In Livorno, it's a staple in dishes like Cacciucco alla livornese, but here, it’s crafted into a ragu with cherry tomatoes. And you know what? It gives a lighter, brighter touch. The result? A sauce that’s rich and tangy, packed with those amazing Mediterranean seafood vibes.
The Tuscan coast is all about making the most of local fish, and this dish really nails it. What really makes this bottarga pasta recipe shine is the finishing touch—thin shavings of bottarga di muggine, or cured mullet roe. It's got a salty punch that's kinda addictive, elevating the already fantastic sauce into something you’ll want to rave about.
While some might be used to classic meat ragù with gnocchi, this seafood version feels just as comforting and way more original. Honestly, the gnocchi soaks up all those savory flavors from the sauce, while those bursts of sweet cherry tomato make it even better. For sure. For anyone into seafood gnocchi or looking to try a traditional Italian gnocchi with a twist, this dish perfectly showcases Tuscan coastal cooking. Every bite hits you with a bit of that crispy, salty bottarga and the deep, satisfying taste of the sea. Pretty much a meal to remember. So, if you're looking to impress or just enjoy a great dinner, this is the dish for you!
