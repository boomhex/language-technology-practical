instructions:
To make Paniscia alla Novarese, first cut the pork rind into strips . Remove the hard part of the cabbage core and set it aside, then cut the leaves into strips .
Heat a drizzle of oil in a high-sided pot, add the pork rind and brown for a few minutes, then add the beans that have been soaked overnight and the cabbage core that was set aside .
Cover with water and bring to a boil . The broth will need to cook for about 40 minutes and will be used for the risotto preparation. Meanwhile, finely chop the shallot .
Clean the sausage from the lard , remove the casing and cut into small pieces . Lastly, dice the lard .
Take a saucepan and melt a pat of butter inside, add the lard and shallot . Season with salt and sauté for a couple of minutes, then add the sausage .
At this point, add the rice and toast it for 3-4 minutes, then deglaze with red wine and let it evaporate completely. Cook the rice by adding a ladle of broth at a time, being careful to gradually also pick up the beans with the pork rind but not the cabbage core .
Halfway through cooking, add the cabbage leaves , season with salt , and continue cooking. When the rice is cooked , turn off the heat and cover with a lid for 2 minutes.
Finally, stir in the butter and grated Grana cheese , add pepper to taste, and mix vigorously. Your Paniscia alla Novarese is ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume Paniscia alla Novarese immediately after preparation. Alternatively, you can store it in the refrigerator for up to one day.
If you can't find salam d’la duja, do not replace it with another type of salami but rather use fresh pork sausage.
In the broth with beans and pork rind, you can also add the outer cabbage leaves after cleaning it.
Historically, the recipe also included the addition of liver mortadella, definitely worth trying!
