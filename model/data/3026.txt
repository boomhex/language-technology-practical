Pasta con fave, zucchine e bottarga is, honestly, something special from the stunning Italian islands of Sardinia and Sicily . You know, these regions really know how to take simple ingredients and turn them into a culinary delight. The star here is definitely the pasta con fave —fresh broad beans—combined with zucchini. It's light, yet fills you up. Seriously good.
And you know what really makes it pop? The bottarga. This salted, dried fish roe is like the Mediterranean’s answer to caviar. It brings a strong, kinda nutty flavor with an almond-like aftertaste that pairs perfectly with the tender veggies. And here's the thing, folks along Italy’s coast can't get enough of it. Packed with magnesium, potassium, iron, and Omega 3s, it’s not just tasty—it’s healthy. Pretty much.
Opt for pasta like spaghetti or linguine. Long shapes, right? They soak up the sauce beautifully, making each bite moist and satisfying. This pasta con bottarga —well, it’s hard to resist, especially the way Sardinians and Sicilians do it. In the summer, when you’re craving something light yet flavorful, it really hits the spot. For sure.
Whether you go for bottarga in powder form or as thin flakes, it adds a rich, slightly salty burst that elevates everything. It feels fancy, yet super casual—like cucina italiana tradizionale should be. Bottarga truly showcases those Mediterranean flavors everyone loves.
The ricetta pasta fave zucchine bottarga is ideal if you're into blending fresh flavors with that punchy, sea-salty finish. Some local chefs might sprinkle lemon zest or fresh herbs to brighten it up a bit—can't go wrong there—but the true stars are still the crisp broad beans and the unmistakable bottarga topping. This dish captures the essence of a day by the sea—golden, simple, with those sunny, relaxed Italian vibes. It’s a meal that not only delights your taste buds but really transports you to the heart of the Mediterranean coast. And the sauce? Perfect.
To prepare the pasta with broad beans, zucchini, and bottarga, start by How to Clean Fava Beans . Detach the end of each pod and split it in half by pressing in the center with your fingers. Gently extract the seeds and remove their outer skin . If using pre-cleaned broad beans, you will need about 14 oz. In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil with a clove of garlic (you can omit it if you don't prefer) and add the broad beans. You can aid the cooking by adding water as needed . Cook the broad beans for about 15 minutes, salt and pepper to taste.
While the broad beans cook for another 15 minutes in the pan, take half of them and blend, adding some hot water to achieve a smooth and thick cream (5-6). Set the obtained cream aside.
In the meantime, wash the zucchini, remove the two ends, and cut them into thin strips . For this step, you can refer to the cooking school guide: how to cut vegetables. Add the zucchini strips to the broad beans in the pan for the last 5 minutes of cooking, stir, and sauté the vegetables . Then also add the broad bean cream, mix the ingredients, and turn off the heat .
In a large pot, bring the water to a boil, salt to taste, and cook the spaghetti . Once cooked, drain them and toss them in the pan to flavor with the sauce over medium heat. Finish mixing the pasta by adding the desired amount of mullet or tuna bottarga . You can also use fresh bottarga to grate directly into the pan. Serve this light and delicious pasta with broad beans, zucchini, and bottarga hot !
Pasta with broad beans, zucchini, and bottarga can be stored for a day in the refrigerator in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap. Freezing is not recommended.
The beauty of this dish lies in the delicate balance of flavors, however, those who love stronger flavors take note: whole bottarga, used in flakes, has a more intense taste, and if you wish, you can garnish the pasta with a few fragrant mint leaves and some cherry tomatoes.
