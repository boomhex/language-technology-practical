To make pasta del maresciallo, start by peeling and finely slicing the onion . Place the sliced onion in a pan , together with the pancetta bacon
and two spoons of olive oil . Brown for around 3 minutes on the stove, on a high flame. Add the crushed tomatoes , salt to taste , stir and cook the sauce for 15 minutes on a moderate flame.
In the meantime, bring salted water to the boil in a saucepan, to cook the pasta. Cook the pasta for as long as it says on the packet and drain when firm to the bite. In the meantime, add the fresh cream to the sauce and stir to amalgamate .
Flavor with the basil leaves and when the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it straight to the pan with the sauce . Saut? the pasta for a few moments so that it finishes cooking and to coat it in the sauce. Serve the pasta nice and hot, garnished with the basil leaves .
Pasta del maresciallo is delicious freshly made, we do not recommend storing it once cooked.
Replace sweet pancetta bacon with a few black olives, for an exquisite vegetarian version!
