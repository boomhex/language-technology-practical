instructions:
To prepare the potatoes in a pressure cooker (with skin) first wash them well . Then transfer them into the 4.5L pressure cooker and add 1 cup of water . Also add a pinch of salt . It is good that the potatoes do not overlap and remain slightly spaced apart.
Close the pressure cooker well with the lid, close the valve , and turn on the heat to medium-high. From the first whistle, indicating that the pot is under pressure, cook them on medium-low heat for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, lift the valve to release the steam (be careful not to burn yourself). As soon as the pot is no longer under pressure and the control valve has dropped, you can open the lid . Remove the potatoes without burning yourself and use them as you like!
To prepare the potatoes in a pressure cooker (without skin), pour a generous drizzle of oil into the 4.5L pressure cooker and let it heat over medium-low heat. Peel the potatoes , pour them into the pressure cooker , and brown them well on all sides . A few minutes will suffice.
Now add 1 cup of water and a pinch of salt (you can also omit it, in any case, it is preferable not to overdo it at this stage, you can always season later) . Close the pressure cooker with its lid, close the valve , and turn on the heat to medium-high. From the first whistle, indicating that the pot is under pressure, lower the heat to medium-low and cook them for 10 minutes.
Once cooked, turn off the heat. Lift the valve so that all the steam contained in the pressure cooker is released quickly (do this operation carefully not to burn yourself). As soon as the pot is no longer under pressure and the control valve has dropped, you can open the lid and transfer the potatoes to a container. Take care of the seasoning, first finely chop the parsley , then in a small bowl pour the oil, salt, and pepper .
Add the parsley, vinegar , and mix well. Now take the potatoes and cut them into quarters . Transfer them to a plate and season with the prepared emulsion. They are excellent both warm and cold.
You can store the cooked potatoes in the pressure cooker for 2 days in the refrigerator.
Freezing is not recommended.
When you turn on the heat under the pressure cooker it can be slightly higher to speed up the process, but as soon as you hear the whistle you should lower it, to maintain medium-low heat during cooking. If the potatoes are large, cook them for an additional 3-4 minutes.
How do you use a pressure cooker?
It is important not to overfill the pressure cooker. Usually, a mark inside the pot indicates the level not to exceed: usually 2/3. For foods that increase in volume, like rice, it is recommended not to exceed half. Before starting cooking, make sure the lid is closed correctly and the valve is closed. As soon as the cooker reaches pressure, you can lower the heat, making the steam release from the valve as constant and "light" as possible. Keeping it on low will also save energy.
How do you open a pressure cooker?
Never open the lid while steam is coming out of the valve. After cooking, you must release all the steam by lifting or turning the valve, and as soon as the pot is no longer under pressure you can open the lid. Be careful of the steam jet during the "decompression" phase.
