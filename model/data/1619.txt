To prepare spelt with swordfish, first start cooking it in plenty of salted boiling water . Then drain it and transfer it to a bowl. Let it cool slightly and in the meantime, chop the parsley .
Then, pour the almonds into a mixer , blend them until you obtain a powder , and transfer them to a bowl. Then grate the orange zest .
and mix it together with the parsley into the almond powder . Add 2 tablespoons of oil , mix everything, and pour it into the bowl with the spelt .
Mix everything and place it in the refrigerator. Move on to the swordfish: cut it into cubes and transfer them to a bowl. Then squeeze both the orange and the half lemon .
and add the juice to the fish . Cover with plastic wrap and let it marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour. After this time, deal with the olives: cut them into small pieces, removing the pit . Then pour 1 tablespoon of oil into a pan, heat it, and add the swordfish cubes, draining them from the marinade and keeping it aside .
Brown it for a couple of minutes, then add the marinade , salt , and add the chopped olives .
Cook for about 5 minutes until the sauce has reduced . Now take the spelt with almonds and distribute it on a plate creating a well in the center , where you will place the swordfish cubes .
