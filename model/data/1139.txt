instructions:
To make the quick pizzettes, first prepare the dough: pour the oil and milk into a large bowl , then add the salt and sugar .
Mix with a fork to emulsify everything . Now add the flour and yeast while continuing to mix with the fork.
When the ingredients are well combined, knead with your hands until you get a firm and homogeneous dough . Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of about 1/5 inch .
At this point, cut out circles with a pastry cutter with a diameter of about 2 3/4 inches , re-kneading and rolling out the scraps until you finish the dough. Place the circles on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them apart, then prick them with the prongs of a fork . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for about 10-12 minutes. When they turn slightly golden on the surface, remove and let cool .
Then spread the pizzettes with stracchino , garnish with arugula , and finish with smoked salmon cut into strips : your quick pizzettes are ready to be served!
The quick pizzettes can be stored in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, for 1-2 days. The untopped pizzettes can be frozen after baking and stored for about 2 months.
You can top the pizzettes as you like, for example, using ricotta or robiola instead of stracchino or replacing smoked salmon with fresh salmon: in this case, season the carpaccio with oil and lemon juice and let it marinate for at least 2 hours (you can take inspiration from the recipe for Crostini with Marinated Salmon ). Garnish with pink peppercorns for a spicy touch!
