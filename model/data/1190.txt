instructions:
To prepare the octopus salad with fennel and oranges, first wash the octopus under running water . Place a pot filled with water on the stove, add salt , and bring to a boil. When the water begins to boil, holding the octopus by the head, dip the tentacles into the boiling water for a few seconds, being careful not to burn yourself . Repeat this process twice,
then immerse it completely and let it cook for 40 minutes. After this time, drain it and cool it under cold water .
Remove the skin, which will come off easily, then cut the octopus into pieces and set aside. Take the fennel, remove the green part of the fronds , and slice the rest .
Wash them well and dry them with a kitchen towel . Then transfer them to a large bowl .
Peel the orange completely and only remove the segments . Cut them into small cubes .
Add the octopus to the fennel , add the orange cubes and black olives . Season with salt and pepper .
Add a drizzle of olive oil and chopped chives . Mix everything and refrigerate until it's time to serve the salad .
The octopus salad with fennel, oranges, and olives can be stored for one day in the refrigerator in a glass bowl, covered with plastic wrap.
Instead of oranges, you can use clementines or pomegranate seeds. Instead of fruit, you can add carrots and dress everything with apple cider vinegar. If you don’t like chives, add fresh chopped parsley instead!
