Branzino in crosta di sale is a Ligurian favorite that turns a simple fish dish into something memorable. And you know what? This branzino al forno gets wrapped in this thick salt crust made with egg whites and a splash of non-alcoholic beer. Seriously good. This combo makes the outside crispy and golden, while the inside stays moist and full of tender juices. Ligurians just love stuffing the fish with chopped herbs and garlic, adding a fresh, green flavor to the sea taste. The salt crust is even shaped like a fish—pretty cool, right? Cracking it open at the table adds an element of surprise, turning any meal into a special occasion.
What sets this ricetta branzino apart from your typical pesce al forno is how the salty, herby shell locks in all the sweet flavors of the fish without drying it out. Really, it’s amazing. The Ligurian style emphasizes wild herbs found along the coast, making the branzino alle erbe even more fragrant. So, here's the thing, you get this cool mix of tangy beer in the crust and the mellow aroma from the garlic inside. Perfect for dinner parties or family gatherings. I mean, when you want something more festive than plain baked fish, this is it. Slicing into the salt crust at the table provides a "wow" moment—no question—revealing all the tender fish inside.
Whether you’re a fan of branzino in crosta di sale or just looking for a fun way to enjoy seafood, this is a ricetta di pesce that really brings people together and makes even a regular evening feel like an event. With its rich flavors and unique presentation, it’s a dish that really, really showcases the best of Ligurian cuisine. And that's the truth.
To prepare the sea bass in a crust of salt, herbs, and beer, start by gutting the sea bass by inserting the knife into the opening near the tail and cutting it up to the head. Empty the belly and then rinse the sea bass under running water.
Chop the herbs with a handful of coarse salt , grate the zest of half a lemon into the mixture and finally add the finely chopped parsley .
Use part of the freshly prepared mixture to fill the fish's belly and add 2 cloves of peeled garlic . Now move on to the salt crust: whip the egg whites to stiff peaks and transfer them into a bowl .
Gently fold into the egg whites the fine and coarse salt , the leftover herb mixture, and grate the zest of the other half of the lemon . Then combine and mix everything together, adding enough beer to achieve a thick and creamy consistency.
Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet and then spread a thin layer (about 0.6 inches) of the obtained mixture, which will form the cooking bed for the sea bass . Then place the sea bass on top of the salt bed and cover it with the salt mixture, pressing gently to adhere the mixture well .
Mold it to fit the fish's natural shape . Bake in a preheated oven at 356°F for about 40 minutes. After the cooking time, remove the sea bass from the oven, let it rest for a moment, then use a small hammer to break the salt crust and proceed to remove the fish's skin: split it in half, removing the central bone, as in any other oven preparation.
For the salt crust, you can also use an alcoholic and very aromatic beer, whose flavor, thanks to the salt, will transfer to the fish, making it even more delicious.
