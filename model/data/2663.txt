To make the dumplings with cherry tomatoes, pesto, and mussels, start by preparing the dumplings: wash the potatoes and, without peeling them, put them in a pot with salted water and let them boil. While still hot, peel them , and mash them with a potato masher
and place them on a work surface where you have arranged the flour in a fountain with a pinch of salt . Knead everything until you get a compact but at the same time soft mixture. At this point, add an egg and continue kneading to have a lump-free and compact dough .
Then, divide the dough into many logs with a thickness of 3/8 inch , cut them into pieces of 5/8 inch with a knife or dough scraper , and gradually place them on a floured tray .
Meanwhile, prepare the Genoese pesto (Pesto alla genovese) : place the peeled garlic in the mortar, start pounding, and when the garlic has turned into a cream, add the basil leaves together with a pinch of coarse salt, which will help crush the fibers better and maintain a bright green color. Then, crush the basil against the mortar walls by turning the pestle . Continue like this until a bright green liquid comes out of the basil leaves, then add the pine nuts and start pounding again to turn into cream. Gradually add the cheeses, continuously stirring, and lastly, pour the extra virgin olive oil in a thin stream , always stirring with the pestle.
Mix the ingredients well until you get a homogeneous sauce . Set the pesto aside and take care of the mussels. How to Clean and Open Mussels : rinse them under fresh running water. With the back of a knife blade, remove all the incrustations, and manually remove the beard. Still under fresh running water and using a steel wool pad , scrub the mussels vigorously to remove all impurities. Cook the mussels by placing them in a pot with a drizzle of olive oil and a clove of garlic , cover them with a lid, and let them open spontaneously over high heat, it will take about 5 minutes.
Remove all the shells and keep the mussels in a small bowl , along with their cooking water. Wash the cherry tomatoes and cut them in half . Cook the cherry tomatoes in a pan with a drizzle of olive oil and chopped aromatic herbs for 10 minutes,
then add the mussels with their water , continue for another 5 minutes, and then incorporate the pesto , stir to flavor and turn off the heat.
Put a pot with plenty of salted water on the stove and bring it to a boil, cook the dumplings for a few minutes , drain them as soon as they surface , and pour them into the pan with the sauce. Let the preparation flavor for a few seconds over medium heat and then serve the dumplings with cherry tomatoes, pesto, and mussels well hot !
Store the dumplings with cherry tomatoes, pesto, and mussels in the refrigerator for a maximum of one day. You can prepare the dumplings in advance and freeze them before cooking: place them on a tray and then, when frozen, transfer them to suitable food bags. This way, you will prevent them from "sticking" together.
If you love seafood, you can vary the preparation by using clams, shrimp, or squid.
