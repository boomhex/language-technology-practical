instructions:
To prepare the baked pumpkin with smoked ricotta shavings, start by cleaning the pumpkin: cut it into quarters and, using a knife, remove the seeds and inner filaments . Then remove the outer skin .
Cut the flesh into slices about 1/4 inch thick and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place each slice so it does not overlap with the others, to ensure even cooking. Drizzle the pumpkin with oil , salt , and pepper.
Flavor the pumpkin by adding a few sprigs of rosemary , then bake it in a static oven preheated to 400°F for 30 minutes (if using a convection oven, bake at 350°F for 20 minutes). At the end of cooking, it should have a slightly golden color. Once baked, remove the rosemary sprigs .
and grate smoked ricotta shavings on top (10-11). Now bake again for 3 minutes in grill mode. Then remove the baking sheet from the oven , let it cool slightly, and enjoy your baked pumpkin with smoked ricotta shavings!
The baked pumpkin with smoked ricotta shavings can be stored in the refrigerator covered with clear plastic wrap for up to 2 days.
It can also be frozen once cooked, but without grating the smoked ricotta shavings, if you have used only fresh and not defrosted ingredients.
A little tip: for this recipe, we used the Mantuan pumpkin which is best suited for this preparation! If you prefer, instead of smoked ricotta, you can grate Pecorino on the pumpkin for a more intense flavor!
Like potatoes and tomatoes, pumpkin is also among the first vegetables imported after the discovery of America. It seems that the first seeds, found in Mexico, date back to 7000 B.C.
