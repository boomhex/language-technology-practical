To prepare the key lime cheesecake, start by setting up the base: place the Digestive biscuits in the mixer together with the brown sugar , then finely chop them and transfer them to a bowl; in the meantime, melt the butter over low heat in a small saucepan. When it is melted, let it cool slightly, add it gently in a thin stream to the crushed biscuits , and mix everything well. Butter a cake pan, preferably with a removable bottom, with a diameter of 9 inches; cut out a circle of parchment paper the same diameter as the bottom of the pan and two strips the same height as the sides, then line the pan itself. For this operation, you can consult the guide Cooking school: how to line a cake pan with parchment paper. Then pour the crumbled biscuits into the cake pan and use the back of a spoon to compact the biscuit base evenly over the entire surface . Allow the mixture to cool in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or in the freezer for about 10 minutes.
Now focus on the filling: put the fresh cream cheese and the 4 egg yolks in a stand mixer fitted with beaters . Alternatively, you can use a large bowl and an electric mixer or a hand whisk. Beat the ingredients until you get a light and fluffy mixture. Then, continue mixing with the beaters while adding the other ingredients: add the grated lime zest and the condensed milk in a thin stream .
Finally, gradually add the lime juice to the mixture and mix the ingredients until you obtain a homogeneous batter . Now your cream is ready. Remove the compacted biscuit base from the refrigerator and pour the cream into the cake pan . Be sure to cover the base evenly, using a spatula to level the surface. Then place the cake in the oven and bake for 60 minutes in a static oven preheated to 340°F. For a convection oven, bake the cheesecake for 35-40 minutes at 300°F .
In the meantime, prepare the cream for the decoration: pour the fresh liquid cream into a bowl and sift the powdered sugar over it . Then, beat the cream and powdered sugar with an electric mixer until the two are well combined . For this operation, you can consult the guide: How to Whip Cream which you can also find How to Whip Cream .
Once the cream is whipped, transfer it to a piping bag with a star tip. Once the cheesecake is done, remove it from the oven, let it cool slightly, and unmold it onto a serving plate, then place it in the refrigerator to chill for 3-4 hours. When it is cold, decorate it with tufts of cream to your liking (13-14). To give your key lime cheesecake an even more scenic touch, you can gently place thin strips of lime zest on each cream tuft !
The key lime cheesecake can be stored in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, for 2-3 days. Alternatively, you can freeze it, preferably dividing it into portions, in suitable food containers. Remember to thaw it slowly in the refrigerator.
If you do not have limes, you can replace them with half the amount of untreated lemon juice and also use their zest. Prepare homemade condensed milk by following How to make condensed milk !
