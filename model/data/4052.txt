instructions:
Baked chickpea bites are a main course that differs from classic meatballs . This recipe is light and nutritious, perfect for those seeking a vegetarian and flavorful alternative. The boiled and mashed potatoes serve as a natural binder thanks to their soft consistency, giving the bites a tender structure. This base is then combined with chickpeas that add a delicate taste and a slightly sweet note. The addition of soaked bread helps provide body to the mixture, making it even more homogeneous and malleable. Once formed, the chickpea bites are gently rolled in breadcrumbs, which adhere to the surface and transform into a light crispy coating during oven baking. They are a versatile dish suitable for various occasions, such as family lunches or dinners.

To prepare baked chickpea bites, start by thoroughly washing the potatoes and boiling them with the skin on. Begin with cold water, and once it reaches a boil, cook for 30-45 minutes depending on their size. Test their doneness by pricking them with a fork . Drain, peel, and mash them with a potato masher , then let them cool completely. Meanwhile, drain the chickpeas, reserving the liquid. Blend them into a smooth, creamy texture .
In a bowl, soak the stale bread with the chickpea liquid and water until it's soft, about 15 minutes. In the bowl with the potatoes, add the chickpea cream , the well-squeezed bread , and the egg .
Adjust the salt , add paprika , and mix all the ingredients .
Next, add the grated cheese and breadcrumbs. Knead until you have a homogeneous mixture. With moistened hands, form balls weighing about 1.75 oz . You will make 13 of them.
Roll them in breadcrumbs and place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Drizzle with a bit of oil and bake in a preheated fan oven at 355°F for 25 minutes, turning them halfway through. Remove from the oven, let cool slightly, and your chickpea bites are ready to be served .
Baked chickpea bites can be stored in the refrigerator in a sealed container for 2 days. If you wish to store them longer, you can freeze them. Place them on a tray so they don't touch and put them in the freezer for a couple of hours. Once frozen, transfer them to a freezer bag or suitable container. This way, they can be stored for 1-2 months.
If the mixture is too soft, you can add some breadcrumbs to achieve a firmer and easier-to-shape consistency. Conversely, if the mixture is too dry, you can add a bit of water. If you wish to make smaller bites for an appetizer or buffet, remember to reduce the baking time.
