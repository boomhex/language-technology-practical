instructions:
To prepare the herb chops with pumpkin and potatoes, start with the herb mixture that will flavor the meat: finely chop the rosemary, sage, bay leaf, oregano, and marjoram ; you will need a total of 0.88 oz of chopped aromatic herbs. Then pour the mixture into a small bowl, add salt and pepper to taste.
Mix the ingredients with your fingers and coat the pork slices with this herb mix . Transfer them to a microwave-safe baking dish lightly oiled and set aside while you prepare the vegetables: peel the potatoes ,
cut them in half and then into small cubes . Slice the pumpkin, remove the skin, and dice it into small cubes as well . Then arrange a layer of potato and pumpkin cubes over the chops in the baking dish .
Drizzle the baking dish with a little oil and, if you prefer, add a few more sprigs of rosemary . Bake the dish in the microwave and cook on steam-assisted mode 3 at 374°F. Then remove the herb chops with pumpkin and potatoes from the oven and serve them hot !
It is recommended to consume the herb chops immediately after cooking. The vegetables can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer, you can choose to accompany the chops with other seasonal vegetables, such as eggplants, zucchini, mushrooms, or cherry tomatoes.
