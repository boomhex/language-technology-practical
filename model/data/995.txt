So... Here's the deal. This dish comes straight out of Northern Italy —really special. It's a cool twist on the classic beer risotto . The magic here? The Weiss or Blanche beer, really—which gives the rice those fruity and citrusy vibes you don’t get with the usual wine-based version. People in places like Parma know culatello well—seriously good stuff. It's this tender, rich Italian cured meat, loaded with flavor without being too much. Pair it up with robiola cheese , and listen, you've got a combo that's both fancy and super surprising.
The beer balances everything, making each bite feel fresh. Almost like it cleans your palate for the next forkful. And you know what? It’s like a mini taste adventure. Digging into this gourmet risotto recipe , you experience how Northern Italians love to experiment while keeping things real. The robiola melts into the rice—making everything smooth and moist. And the culatello? It adds bursts of salty goodness—so so tasty.
It’s not your standard risotto. Using beer instead of wine is a fun move, for real, bringing out something way way better. Some say the result is a treat, a little party for your taste buds. Since this isn't the most traditional recipe, it's the kind of dish you'd wanna show off at a dinner with friends who love trying new things. Next time you’re considering risotto with beer, this combo of culatello , robiola cheese , and that hint of tangy beer will remind you how Italian food always surprises. Even if you usually stick to classic cured meats, this dish is a great way to see just how creative things can get up in the north—innovation with tradition in every bite. Pretty much perfect.
To prepare the beer risotto with culatello and robiola, start by immediately heating the Vegetable broth . Continue by peeling the onion, chopping it with a knife, and stewing it in a saucepan with the butter: make sure to let it sweat over low heat so it doesn't burn. If necessary, you can add a few tablespoons of hot broth. Once it becomes transparent, remove it from the pan and set it aside. In its place, pour the rice and toast it for 30 seconds. Deglaze with the beer and as soon as it evaporates, add the onion and a little broth at a time, stirring, until you've cooked the rice, seasoning with salt to taste. In the meantime, focus on the culatello. Cut it into thin strips and when the rice is al dente, remove it from the heat and add the robiola, Grana Padano DOP, and a tablespoon of broth. Cover with the lid and let it rest for a couple of minutes. Mix well and then serve in dishes, adding some strips of culatello and chopped chives. Your beer risotto with culatello and robiola is ready: enjoy your meal!
It is recommended to consume the beer risotto with culatello and robiola immediately, although you can store it in the fridge for a couple of days.
