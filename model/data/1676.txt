instructions:
To make the almond and orange balls, first wash the orange and take a quarter . Meanwhile, place the blanched almonds in a blender and blend them until they are powdered by operating the blender in bursts so as not to overheat the almonds too much.
Add the sugar , the orange segment, and the liquor , give another spin of the blades to mix the mixture, and if it turns out to be too dry, add a little more orange juice .
Once the dough is ready , transfer it to a larger bowl and with moistened hands, take about 1-1.25 oz of dough and form balls the size of a walnut .
At this point, roll each ball in sugar so that the sugar adheres well to the entire surface . As you form the balls, place them on a tray and if you prefer, put them in some pretty colored wrappers, let the almond and orange balls rest for 2-3 hours at room temperature before serving them !
The almond and orange balls can be stored in the refrigerator for 4-5 days. They can be frozen.
Rum, Grand Marnier, or Maraschino, choose the aroma you want to impart to these little delights!
