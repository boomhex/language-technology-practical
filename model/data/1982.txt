instructions:
To prepare baked feta, first preheat the oven to 350°F in static mode, then prepare the ingredients you will need: wash the tomatoes, remove the stem part, and slice them thinly . Peel the red onion, cut it in half lengthwise, and slice it thinly crosswise . Place the slices of tomatoes and onion in a bowl ,
then add the black olives , half the amount of olive oil , a pinch of salt, and mix all ingredients well .
Now take a ceramic baking dish (we used an 18 cm square dish, approximately 7 inches per side) and line the base with tomato slices . Place the whole feta in the center and distribute the remaining mixture around the sides .
To finish, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and a handful of oregano leaves , then bake in the preheated static oven at 350°F for about an hour. After this time, your baked feta will be ready to be served !
Baked feta can be stored in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to 3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
The layer of tomatoes at the base serves to prevent the feta from coming into direct contact with the baking dish and thus risking burning and sticking, so make sure to cover the bottom evenly. Baked feta is usually served in individual portions because it crumbles easily once cut: if you wish, you can also bake it in cute ramekins!
