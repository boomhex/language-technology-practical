So, let's talk about these breaded cutlets you find in Central-Southern Italy. They're everywhere, and honestly, they're a big deal. Unlike the thick Milanese version, you'll see more of the thin beef slices like noce di manzo or magatello here. These choices make the meat really tender—you know what I mean? And, the coating method? Flour, egg, breadcrumbs. Really simple, right? But so, so effective. It gets that exterior crispy and light, which is just what you want.
In places like Lazio or Campania, these cutlets are perfect for a quick lunch or chill dinner. They're totally different from the Northern style; the beef stays juicy, and the coating—golden and crunchy—totally satisfies. It's really no wonder people love these when they crave something good.
Some folks might compare them to chicken schnitzel or Japanese katsu, but the taste—let me tell you—is rooted in Italian home cooking. It's not about fancy ingredients at all. It's about using quality beef and that triple-dip breading, keeping each piece moist inside and delightfully crispy outside. It is pretty simple.
There are loads of ways to enjoy these easy chicken cutlet recipes . Add a squeeze of lemon? Sure. Tuck them into a sandwich? Why not! Many just dive in, hot from the pan, with a salad or roasted veggies. And listen, the flour-before-egg step is not just some random trick—it's vital for extra crunch and keeping the meat super juicy inside.
Unlike the baked chicken cutlets that can sometimes dry out, these pan-fried chicken cutlets stay juicy, packed with deep flavors. Whether you stick with beef or try other meats, these homemade chicken cutlets are really, really something. They bring a sweet taste of Italian tradition right to your kitchen. So here's the deal: enjoying these cutlets is like having a little slice of Italy on your plate. Makes every meal feel special, for real.

To prepare breaded slices, first pound them if they are too thick . Then pass them first in flour and then in previously beaten eggs .
Finally, pass them in breadcrumbs . Between each step, always be sure to shake them to remove excess. Continue this way until all 4 slices are breaded and transfer them to a plate as you go . At this point, pour the clarified butter into a large skillet .
When the butter is well melted and hot, immerse the first slice . Let it brown for 2-3 minutes, then turn it using tongs and wait another 2-3 minutes. Drain it and transfer it to a tray with paper towels to remove excess fat . Salt and serve your breaded slices while still hot!
If you're looking for a tasty side dish, try our buttered potatoes. Wash and cut the new potatoes in half . In a skillet, pour the butter and aromatic herbs, let it melt, then add the potatoes . Cook gently for about twenty minutes, stirring occasionally; add salt and pepper to taste. Serve the buttered potatoes with our breaded slices .
You can bread the slices a little in advance and store them in the refrigerator. If you prefer, you can also freeze them by wrapping them separately in plastic wrap.
Once cooked, we recommend consuming the breaded slices immediately. You can also store them in the fridge for a day and then reheat them, but they might not be as tender as when freshly made!
Clarified butter has a higher smoke point, allowing you to reach higher temperatures without burning, ensuring your cutlet is always well browned. If you can't find clarified butter, you can use oil instead. Both extra virgin and seed oil are fine. Alternatively, you can mix them.
It's always better to cook meat at room temperature to prevent the cold from storage from lowering the cooking base temperature too much: in this case, the breading might separate.
