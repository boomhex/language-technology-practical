instructions:
To prepare the rice flour cookies, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add cold butter, brown sugar , salt , and lemon zest . Mix for a couple of minutes.
Add both the whole egg and the yolk . Continue mixing for a couple more minutes with the whisk attachment. Add the rice flour .
and the baking powder , mix again until you get a homogeneous mixture . Transfer the dough onto a work surface, form it into a ball, and wrap it with plastic wrap . Let the dough rest for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator.
Take the chilled dough from the fridge . Take pieces of about 1 oz and form balls with your hands .
Place the dough balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and gently flatten them with your fingers . With these quantities, you will get about 32 cookies, so you can make multiple batches . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven. Once finished baking , let them cool completely on the baking sheet before enjoying them.
They can be stored for 1 week in a tin box or glass jar. You can freeze the raw dough.
After baking, they will be very crumbly, so it's necessary to let them cool completely before removing them from the baking sheet.
For gluten-free recipes, we recommend purchasing only products that have the crossed-out ear label on the packaging, certified gluten-free, recommended by the AIC Italian Celiac Association's guide.
. If a stand mixer is not available, how should you proceed?
In this case, you can knead by hand.
. Can butter be substituted with oil?
Substitutions don't always yield the same result; in general, you can try substituting butter with oil, keeping in mind that 100 g of butter can be replaced with a maximum of 80-85 g of seed oil.
. Can granulated sugar be used instead of brown sugar?
You can use granulated sugar while keeping the quantities unchanged.
. To make them more delicious, can they be covered with chocolate?
Of course, they can be covered with our Chocolate glaze after baking.
. Can another type of flour be used?
This recipe is calibrated for rice flour; if you want to use another flour, you must consider that each product has a different liquid absorption capacity, therefore requiring different dosages to test and experiment with.
