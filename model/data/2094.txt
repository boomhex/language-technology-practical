To prepare John Dory with peaches and chard, start by cleaning the latter. Remove the ends of the stalks , split the leaves in half , and rinse them under running water .
Slice the spring onion and transfer it to a pan where you have already added a drizzle of oil . Let it soften for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally, then add the red chard stalks.
Cover with a lid . Cook for about ten minutes, and when they have wilted, season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking for a couple more minutes , then set them aside.
Wash the nectarine, cut it in half using a knife , remove the pit, and first slice it into 0.4-inch thick slices and then into cubes .
Transfer the cubes to a large bowl , and add the lemon balm leaves, after chopping them with a knife . Season with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of oil.
Now move on to the John Dory fillets; it's best not to remove the skin so they don't fall apart during cooking. Cut the fillets in half to obtain 8 smaller pieces. Heat a drizzle of oil in a pan and place the John Dory fillets skin-side down , salt to taste, and cook for 2-3 minutes in total over high heat, flipping the fillets halfway through . Then turn off the heat.
If necessary, in the meantime, slightly reheat the red chard before plating. Divide the red chard among the serving plates , add the nectarine cubes , and finally the fish fillets . John Dory with peaches and chard is ready to serve!
It is recommended to consume John Dory with peaches and chard as soon as it is prepared; alternatively, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. Freezing is not recommended.
Can't find red chard? No problem! Try replacing it with fresh spinach! Instead of lemon balm, you can use lemon thyme, or you can enrich your John Dory with peaches and chard with the grated zest of 1 lemon.
John Dory, also known as "Sampietro" and in Italy as "pesce gallo" or "pesce cetra," prefers sandy bottoms and lives up to about 200 meters deep, mainly in the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic. The main feature is two large dark spots in the center of the fish's sides: according to legend, they represent the fingerprints of Saint Peter, the fisherman saint from whom the fish takes its name. Once in Saint Peter's hand, the fish supposedly spat out a coin, which was then used to pay a toll to Roman soldiers for maintaining the Temple.
