instructions:
To prepare the ricotta gnudi with vegetable ragù, start with the gnudi dough: in a bowl, add well-drained sheep ricotta and eggs , then flavor with nutmeg and lemon zest .
Mix with a whisk to achieve a smooth and creamy consistency, then season with salt and pepper . Now, fold in the grated Parmigiano Reggiano and flour .
Continue to mix well to combine everything . Store the dough in the refrigerator and proceed with the preparation of the saffron sauce: clean and chop the onion , then peel and dice the potato .
Do the same with the carrot . In a pan, pour a drizzle of oil along with the onion . Sauté for a minute, then add the potato .
Also add the carrot , season with salt and cover with water . Cook for 30 minutes over medium heat .
When the vegetables are cooked, turn off the heat and enhance with saffron threads , then mix well to release aroma and color . Transfer the vegetables to a jug and add a drizzle of oil .
Blend with an immersion blender to obtain a smooth and homogeneous sauce . Set the saffron sauce aside and focus on the vegetable ragù: clean the aglione .
Cut it into slices about half a centimeter thick, it shouldn't be too thin . Clean and dice all the vegetables into about half-inch cubes: start with the red onion and celery .
Continue with the zucchini , yellow peppers , and red peppers .
Finally, the eggplants . In a large pan, heat a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil with the aglione, a chopped chili pepper, and a sprig of thyme . Sauté for 3-4 minutes, then add the onion .
After a minute, add the celery , peppers , and eggplants, sauté for another couple of minutes. Finally, add the zucchini .
Cook everything for a total of about 10 minutes; the vegetables should remain crispy. Salt only at the end of cooking . Flavor the vegetable ragù with basil leaves and keep warm. Now cook the gnudi: bring a pot of salted water to a boil, then retrieve the dough from the fridge and form quenelles using 2 spoons .
Dip one of the spoons in boiling water and use it to slide the quenelle into the pot; this way, it will detach easily. Cook the gnudi for about 10 minutes, then drain them and place them on a tray; this recipe yields about 16, the number may vary depending on the size. You're ready to plate: spread the saffron sauce on the base of the plate .
Place the cooked gnudi on top and add the vegetable ragù in the center . Finish with a drizzle of raw oil and fresh basil leaves. Serve your ricotta gnudi with vegetable ragù immediately !
It is recommended to consume the ricotta gnudi with vegetable ragù freshly made.
Already formed and raw ricotta gnudi can be stored in the fridge, covered, for up to 12 hours. They can be frozen for about a month and boiled while still frozen.
Cooked ricotta gnudi should be consumed within a day, stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container.
It is advisable to drain the ricotta in a sieve for a few hours in the refrigerator, so it will lose its whey and the dough won't be too soft.
If you can't find aglione, you can use regular garlic.
The vegetables can be varied according to the season: use asparagus and peas in spring, pumpkin and kale in winter. To keep them crispy, salt them only at the end of cooking so they won't release their liquid.
For a bolder taste, you can add a few drops of lemon or a pinch of chili pepper to the saffron sauce.
