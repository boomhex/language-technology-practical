Cappellacci from Emilia-Romagna are those dishes that just stop you in your tracks—making you savor the joy of homemade pasta. I mean, really good stuff. These little pockets get a special twist with turmeric . It adds a warm color and a subtle, spicy kick. You don’t usually expect that in a cappellacci recipe , right? The dough is rolled tender and thin, wrapped around a rich filling made from Grana Padano cheese —specifically the Riserva DOP, known for its deep flavor and creamy texture. For real, it’s amazing.
In true Italian style, the finished pasta gets tossed in a bit of golden butter and even more grated Grana Padano. Which is great. This lets those few ingredients really really shine. The hint of turmeric plays off the nutty notes of the cheese, giving this turmeric pasta its own character without overpowering the classic vibe. So here's the deal, in Emilia-Romagna, folks like to keep things simple with the butter sauce. Pretty simple.
But here's the thing, this dish is super versatile. Depending on what's fresh at the market, people sometimes add light vegetable sauces, roasted pumpkin, or even a mix of seasonal veggies on the side. That’s the cool thing about Grana Padano pasta like this—it lets you experiment while still respecting tradition. And you know what? The moist filling stays soft inside the pasta, and the butter sauce adds just enough richness to make every bite feel special.
For anyone who loves homemade cappellacci or wants something different from the usual ravioli, this dish definitely gives you both flavor and comfort. It is the kind of food that brings together the best of traditional Italian recipes and a bit of creativity, all on one plate. Whether you’re sharing it with friends or just treating yourself, pasta with turmeric and Grana Padano shows how simple ingredients can come together in a way that feels a bit luxurious and super satisfying. Plus, the regional ingredients really highlight the heart of Emilia-Romagna, making every bite a tribute to its culinary roots.
To prepare the turmeric cappellacci with butter and Grana Padano, start with the fresh pasta: in a large bowl, pour the flour, flavor with turmeric , add the eggs and salt .
Work the ingredients by hand first in the bowl , then once well mixed, move to the work surface and knead until you get a smooth and homogeneous, firm dough . Set aside for 30 minutes at room temperature wrapped in plastic wrap. In the meantime, prepare the filling: pour the grated Grana Padano DOP Riserva into a saucepan .
Add the fresh liquid cream and let it cook over low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally .
Once ready, transfer the cream into a tall container and blend with an immersion blender for a few moments . Cover with plastic wrap and let cool in the refrigerator until use. Take the pasta , and take the first piece .
Roll it very thin with the pasta machine, passing the fresh pasta through the roller at least twice, at the penultimate step of the machine, to obtain a thickness of about a quarter inch . Do the same for each piece of fresh pasta .
From each, cut squares of 2.5x2.5 inches , fill each square with half a teaspoon of Grana Padano DOP Riserva filling . Lightly brush the edges with water .
First close into a triangle , press the edges well to seal , then fold the two ends towards the center .
Close the cappellacci by joining the two ends , pressing well. Continue this way for all the others .
Now that they are ready, proceed to cook and season: bring plenty of water to a boil in a large saucepan and salt it at the boil. In a large pan, gently heat the butter, adding a ladle of cooking water. Cook your cappellacci in boiling salted water for about 3 minutes . Then drain them directly into the pan with the butter , add a ladle of water as needed .
Season with grated Grana Padano DOP , mix to emulsify, and they will be ready to be plated .
We recommend consuming them immediately once ready. Alternatively, store the cappellacci in the fridge in an airtight container for 1 day and reheat as needed.
Uncooked cappellacci can be frozen on a tray and once hardened, placed in freezer bags, for up to 3 months.
You can freeze the fresh pasta raw, rolled into sheets or cut into ready-to-use squares. Freeze them on trays, separating the layers with parchment paper. Once well-hardened, place them in freezer bags and store them back in the freezer. When you need them, boil them directly from frozen in boiling water and proceed as per the recipe.
You can also add chives or thyme to the filling.
You can flavor the seasoning with sage or add diced pancetta!
