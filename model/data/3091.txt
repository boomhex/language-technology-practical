Cupcake fiamma al Nesquik is one of those desserts that's just plain fun. I mean, these cupcakes ? So, so soft and moist—thanks to that classic Nesquik powder we all remember from our childhood. And the real showstopper? It’s gotta be the topping. You get this big, fluffy swirl of strawberry meringue that’s not your everyday frosting. It’s crafted from a sugar syrup heated to a perfect 121°C, mixed with strawberry juice. Which is great. It gives the meringue this pretty pink color and a tangy twist.
Once you pile that meringue on the cupcakes, they head back into the oven for a bit. The outside gets crispy and a touch golden, like little flames flickering on top—totally fitting the “fiamma” name. And look, this dessert is like a sweet mashup of American cupcake vibes with a creative twist. People really love them at birthday parties or even just as a weekend treat. If you're into chocolate Nesquik cupcakes , you're gonna be really, really into these.
You know, it’s all about that Nesquik cupcake recipe flavor, but with an unexpected twist. The meringue adds something you just don’t see in the usual cupcakes. Folks who love a good chocolate Nesquik cupcake or other Nesquik chocolate desserts will find the cake stays surprisingly tender, despite the fancy topping. And listen, the strawberry meringue isn’t just for looks—it brings a sweet fruity note that complements the chocolate perfectly. Plus, when that meringue sets in the oven, each bite has this little crunch before you hit the soft center.
If you want to bring something a bit different to any gathering, these cupcakes are the way to go. They're super tasty and definitely show off both flavor and style. Seriously good. They’re the kind of easy Nesquik cupcakes that make you look like a pro baker, even though they’re pretty simple to pull off.
To prepare the flame cupcakes, sift the flour and the Nesquik into a bowl. Meanwhile, place the softened butter and sugar in another bowl and
beat them using a hand mixer until combined and the mixture is fluffy . Then add the yolk, beat with the mixer, and when it is incorporated, add the whole egg and incorporate it while continuing to beat . Now add the flour and Nesquik mixture and stir to combine all the ingredients .
Then add the baking powder and continue to mix until you obtain a homogeneous and lump-free batter . Place the cupcake liners in the cupcake tin, transfer the batter to a piping bag without a nozzle, and divide it into each liner
filling them to 3/4 of their height . Bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 15-20 minutes (or a fan oven at 300°F for 10-15 minutes), checking the doneness with a toothpick. Once baked, let the cupcakes cool and set them aside . Place the whole strawberries, washed and trimmed, in a blender and blend until
a puree is obtained . Pass the puree through a fine mesh sieve to remove any lumps and seeds: you should obtain 1.41 oz (40 g) of juice in total . Pour the strawberry juice into a small saucepan and
add the sugar . Stir to dissolve the sugar over low heat . When the syrup forms and begins to boil, immerse a sugar (or food) thermometer and bring the mixture to 248°F-250°F .
Meanwhile, beat the egg whites with a hand mixer or a stand mixer whisk at medium speed until stiff peaks form . When the syrup reaches the indicated temperature (250°F), pour it in a thin stream over the egg whites , continuing to beat not only until the syrup is finished but also until the meringue is completely cooled. The strawberry meringue should be very thick, smooth, and shiny .
Transfer the strawberry meringue to a piping bag with a star nozzle and pipe a generous swirl onto each cupcake . Place the cupcakes on a baking tray and bake them in a static oven at 480°F for 2-3 minutes until the meringue begins to color . Your flame cupcakes are ready!
Flame cupcakes can be stored at room temperature under a glass dome for a maximum of 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can make the meringue with the fruit you prefer: just replace the 1.41 oz (40 g) of strawberry juice with the same amount of juice from another fruit of your choice.
