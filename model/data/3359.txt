When autumn rolls around in South and Central Italy, Sfoglie con crema di castagne e scamorza becomes a must-try. Really, it’s everywhere. These flaky chestnut cream puff pastry bites are filled with this smooth, slightly sweet chestnut spread. But the real magic is the scamorza affumicata —a Southern Italian smoked cheese that adds a mellow, golden flavor. As it melts, every bite gives you that melty and stretchy texture, blending sweet and smoky flavors perfectly. Honestly, a sprinkle of toasted pine nuts adds a crispy crunch that’s just amazing, balancing with the soft pastry and creamy filling. Italians adore this combo in cooler months, especially when chestnuts fill the markets—and kitchens.
Enjoying these chestnut and scamorza puff pastry treats is like savoring a little bit of heaven, slowly. Whether it’s a starter or a snack at those autumn gatherings, it’s perfect. First off, you’ll notice the balance: nutty chestnut cream, gooey scamorza cheese, and a touch of woodsy smoke all wrapped up in buttery pastry. Not just rich or fancy; it’s like a rustic, homey snack. Yet, special enough for guests. And, I gotta say, recipes like this highlight why the Italian chestnut season is such a big deal and why savory pastries are interesting. If you’re looking to spice up your fall menu, this chestnut cream and scamorza recipe is super easy to love, even if chestnuts aren’t your usual thing.
You'll enjoy a moist, soft center, a crispy edge, and that special smoked cheese flavor—really, it stands out in Italian chestnut recipes and any savory puff pastry with chestnuts. It’s just a simple, really nice way to bring a slice of Italy’s autumn right to your table. Plus, it makes every gathering feel a bit more special and connected to the traditions of Italian cuisine. For sure.
To prepare the puff pastries with chestnut cream and smoked scamorza, start by spreading each pastry with a generous teaspoon of chestnut cream (if you want, you can use a piping bag with a star tip) . Cut the smoked scamorza into small slices (at least 0.39 inches thick) , grease a griddle with a tiny bit of oil
and when it is very hot, place the pieces of scamorza on it . Once a golden crust has formed on one side , flip them over to complete cooking. Place the slice of smoked scamorza (lifting it with a spatula) on each pastry and decorate the appetizers with some pine nuts !
