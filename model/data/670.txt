instructions:
To prepare the fried pizza strips, first pour the yeast into half of the indicated water dose . Mix well to dissolve it and pour it into a large bowl where you have already added the flour .
Start mixing with a fork , then add the remaining water and mix again .
Add oil and finally the salt . Work it further in the bowl, then transfer onto a surface and continue kneading .
When you achieve a rather smooth consistency , shape into a ball and transfer it into a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for 6 hours at room temperature.
After this time, chop the sun-dried tomatoes and slice the olives . Then take back the dough, which will have doubled in volume .
Transfer it onto a surface and deflate it by pressing with your hands . Add sun-dried tomatoes and olives .
Close the dough to incorporate them and knead quickly until obtaining a homogeneous mixture .
Now roll out the dough with a rolling pin and using a pastry wheel, make first vertical strips and then some diagonal cuts , to create diamond shapes .
Now heat the oil well and immerse a few pieces at a time, using a skimmer , cook until they are golden brown. Drain them , transfer onto absorbent paper, add a pinch of salt, and serve your fried pizza strips .
We recommend consuming the fried pizza strips as soon as they're ready!
You can also use diced cold cuts or onions in the dough!
