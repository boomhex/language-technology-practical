Cheesecake ricotta e amarene brings together the best of both worlds—classic American cheesecake style with that unmistakable Italian twist. And listen, what stands out immediately is how the creamy ricotta filling mingles with those succulent amarene cherries. Really good stuff. In this version, the cheesecake ricotta e amarene isn’t just your basic dessert; it’s got that crunchy cocoa cookie base that gives each bite a little something extra. You’ll spot the cherries arranged in a spiral right at the bottom, which isn’t just for looks—it makes sure you get that syrupy, sweet fruit flavor in every single slice. Pretty much. Italian desserts often use ricotta, but combining it with amarene like this is a real treat, especially when you’re in the mood for something special to cap off a meal or to serve up at a family gathering.
While many folks rave about New York cheesecake, the ricetta cheesecake amarene offers a totally different experience. The filling is lighter, thanks to the ricotta, and the base stays crunchy even after baking, providing a mix of textures—moist and rich, yet never too heavy. And you know what? It’s a showstopper when you cut into it and see the golden cherries perfectly lined up inside. This is the kind of cheesecake italiana tradizionale that really really makes an impression, especially if you’re tired of the usual desserts and want something that looks as good as it tastes. In Italy, some people opt for a cheesecake ricotta amarene senza cottura for summer, but the baked version is perfect when you’re aiming for a dessert that feels a bit more special. Each bite blends that tangy fruit with smooth ricotta and the chocolatey base, and the whole thing just works together in a way that feels both familiar and new. So, whether you’re a fan of dolce con ricotta e amarene or just want to try a really tasty take on cheesecake, this dessert has you covered. Seriously good. It’s a fantastic choice for any occasion, bringing a touch of elegance to your table with every bite. Enjoy the really good harmony of flavors that this Italian-inspired creation offers, making every moment a bit more indulgent. For sure.
To make the ricotta and black cherry cheesecake, start with the cookie base: finely chop the chocolate cookies in a mixer . Add the brown sugar , then combine the chocolate with butter and melt it in a double boiler (or microwave).
Pour the obtained sauce into the crushed cookie mixture , then mix and transfer the dough into a 9-inch diameter springform pan lined with parchment paper : using the back of a spoon, press well onto the base and sides of the pan . Place the base to set in the freezer for 30 minutes or in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Now, work on the cream: beat the eggs with sugar until a light mixture is obtained and flavor with the seeds of a vanilla bean . Separately, sift the ricotta through a sieve to eliminate any lumps , then drain the black cherries and set aside 50 ml of syrup. Add the ricotta to the egg mixture .
and sift the cornstarch into the cream . Finally, pour the fresh liquid cream, condensed milk , and the cherry juice you set aside and mix the mixture with a whisk to blend the ingredients.
Take back the cookie base and arrange the whole black cherries on top creating a spiral pattern , place it back in the freezer for at least 15 minutes then take it out and pour the cream into the mold (14-15) and bake the cheesecake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 30 minutes (or 320°F for 20 minutes for a fan oven); after this time, lower the temperature to 320°F and continue baking for another 30 minutes (or 280°F for 20 minutes in a fan oven).
Once baking is complete , remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool. Meanwhile, prepare the ganache: heat the cream and butter in a saucepan , pour the hot mixture over the dark chocolate and stir with a spatula to melt it,
transfer the obtained chocolate sauce to a bowl full of ice and whip it with beaters to obtain a compact and firm cream that you will transfer to a piping bag with a star-shaped nozzle . Decorate the cake with dollops of dark chocolate ganache and whole black cherries . Your ricotta and black cherry cheesecake is ready to be enjoyed!
Store the ricotta and black cherry cheesecake for 2-3 days in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap. The dessert can be frozen, perhaps in slices to defrost only the necessary portions.
If you do not like ricotta, you can substitute it with another fresh spreadable cheese.
