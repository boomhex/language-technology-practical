Caffè Padovano —let me tell you—it's a special little treat from Padua, nestled in the Veneto region of Italy. Folks up there really, really know their coffee. But this isn't your everyday cup of joe. Nope, this is dessert in a glass. So here's the thing: you start with a shot of fresh espresso and then give it a twist. Instead of just pouring coffee, you plop in a spoonful of white chocolate and mint ganache . And look, that ganache melts right into the hot coffee, making it all extra creamy and smooth. It's got this touch of sweet from the chocolate and a little zing from the mint. Super tasty.
You’d find it in those cozy northern Italian cafes—think lots of charm—where people love playing around with classic recipes but never forget the basics. Plus, a light dusting of cocoa powder on top just makes it look and taste even better. All the ingredients are simple, but somehow the whole thing just comes together. It's comforting and a bit surprising at the same time. Thing is, unlike some other Italian coffee desserts, Caffè Padovano isn't heavy or over-the-top.
It's about enjoying that warm, moist espresso with a creamy, almost tender ganache layer that floats on top. People in Veneto are serious about good ingredients, so the espresso is made the traditional way—usually with a moka pot, bringing out a deep, rich flavor. The ganache is the real twist here—it’s not something you'd find in every old-school Italian coffee drink. And you know what? That blend of mint and white chocolate totally wakes up your taste buds, while the cocoa on top just ties everything together.
Maybe you've seen regular caffè with a dash of liquor or whipped cream, but this Padua version is kinda its own thing. It's simple, elegant , and just a bit playful. Really works great after dinner, especially if you want something a little lighter but still special. I mean, for real, it’s the kind of dessert that feels just right when you want to slow down and enjoy a small but memorable taste of Northern Italy.
To prepare Padovan coffee, start by making the white chocolate and mint ganache (we recommend preparing it the night before): heat the cream in a saucepan over low heat, without bringing it to a boil , then melt the white chocolate pieces in it, stirring often . Once all the chocolate has melted, add the white mint syrup and mix well .
Transfer the obtained mixture to a bowl and place it in the refrigerator to cool for 24 hours ; after the indicated time, remove it from the refrigerator and whip it using electric beaters . Now take a spoonful of ganache and spread it on the side of a medium glass .
Now prepare the coffee using a moka pot. To get excellent coffee, fill the boiler of your coffee maker with cold, low-limestone water, being careful not to exceed the safety valve (otherwise you'll get a longer coffee). Fill the filter with ground coffee forming a “mound“ , which you will level by tapping the filter on the table with firm movements . Do not press with the spoon, nor make holes in the surface.
Screw the coffee maker tightly (to prevent the coffee from leaking from the sides while rising), then place it on a low and steady flame, to obtain a full-bodied coffee. As the coffee rises, a dense froth will form ; we recommend not letting it bubble too long, to maintain its aroma and sweetness. Your coffee is ready: before pouring, stir it directly in the moka with a teaspoon, to make it more homogeneous .
Now pour about 1.35 oz (40 ml) of coffee into the glass (equivalent to a cup) and decorate with a light dusting of bitter cocoa (14-15).
We recommend consuming Padovan coffee immediately. Once whipped, the ganache can be stored in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, for up to three days.
