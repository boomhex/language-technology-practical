Gluten-free biscotti from Italy bring a whole new vibe to breakfast, especially when you want something tender yet still sturdy enough to dunk in your morning coffee. Really good stuff. These rustic cookies get their unique texture from special flours like rice flour and teff, which come together to make each bite a little chewy, a little crispy, and totally satisfying. In Italian homes, particularly where gluten intolerance is a concern, folks really really appreciate recipes like this. And look, they offer a way for everyone at the table to enjoy the same food. Forget about those packaged options that can taste bland or dry—making a gluten-free biscotti recipe at home means you get way more control over the flavors and the moist texture that makes breakfast feel special. Plus, swapping in things like almond flour or making a butter-free version is a smart move for anyone who wants a healthier twist without missing out on taste.
In many Italian households, breakfast is kept pretty simple—think a cookie, maybe a few slices of bread, and a hot drink. That’s where these gluten-free Italian cookies really shine, fitting right into those quiet, early-morning meals. People love dipping these cookies in warm milk, watching as they soak up just enough to get soft but not fall apart. It’s a little moment of comfort. Pretty much makes everyone feel included, even if someone needs to follow a special diet. Some folks even experiment with other gluten-free treats, like muffins, using similar blends of flour. And you know what? Each one turns out with its own golden color and sweet bite. There’s a lot of pride in being able to bake homemade gluten-free biscotti that actually taste great—nothing chalky or boring here. For sure. Whether you go for gluten-free almond biscotti with a handful of nuts mixed in or just stick to the classic, these cookies always add something good to the breakfast table. Sharing them with family just makes mornings feel a bit brighter and more connected. Plus, trying out different variations keeps breakfast exciting and ensures there's always something new to look forward to.
To prepare gluten-free cookies, take a stand mixer with a dough hook (alternatively, you can make the dough by hand, quickly working all the cold ingredients in the indicated order) and pour in the buckwheat flour, the brown rice flour , potato starch, coconut flour , baking powder ,
sugar , unsweetened cocoa powder , and the butter cut into pieces .
Set the stand mixer to medium speed and mix everything until you get a sandy texture . At this point, keeping the mixer running, gradually pour the eggs into the bowl and continue mixing until fully incorporated into the mixture .
Transfer the dough to a work surface and form a smooth and homogeneous dough ball with your hands , then wrap it with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator to rest for about half an hour. After this time, preheat the oven to 350°F in static mode, then take the dough and roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 0.4 inches: you should form a rectangle about 12x8 inches . At this stage, try to work the dough quickly so as not to heat it too much with your hands.
Using a smooth-edged knife, cut the rectangle in half lengthwise, then cut smaller rectangles about 1.2 inches wide and 3.1 inches long : with these quantities, you should obtain 18 cookies . Now make holes on the surface using a cookie cutter or the prongs of a fork .
Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them well apart , and sprinkle the surface with brown sugar , then bake in the preheated static oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes, placing them on the lower rack. Once baked and cooled, your gluten-free cookies are ready to be dunked !
Gluten-free cookies can be stored outside the refrigerator for about a week. It is not recommended to freeze the dough.
Instead of coconut flour, you can use another type of gluten-free flour, such as hazelnut or almond flour. However, you cannot substitute it with desiccated coconut: having a different consistency would change the final result.
For gluten-free recipes, we recommend purchasing only products with the crossed-out ear of wheat on the packaging, certified gluten-free, recommended by the AIC Associazione Italiana Celiachia guide.
