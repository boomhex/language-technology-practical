Friarielli and eggs in a pan —a classic from Campania —is just perfect for when you crave comfort and speed after a long day. I mean, you can't go wrong with Italian greens and eggs paired with that Southern Italian flair. It's super tasty and no fuss. Friarielli, kinda like sautéed broccoli rabe , is a winter staple in Neapolitan kitchens. And listen, unlike friggitelli—those sweet peppers—friarielli brings a slightly bitter kick that totally wakes up your taste buds.
The magic? It starts with garlic and chili sizzlin' away, and the kitchen smells warm and inviting before you even toss in the greens. Sauté them until just tender—keeps that fresh bite. And look, this is what Neapolitans whip up when they want something easy but full of flavor.
Seriously, nothing beats digging into eggs in a pan over a bed of soft, moist greens. Plus, with a piece of perfectly toasted bread—super crispy—it’s heaven. Add toasted pine nuts for a nutty crunch that really really elevates everything. Best part? Cracking into the egg and watching that yolk ooze out. So so rich. It seeps into everything, making it extra special.
This texture and flavor combo is your go-to for a quick egg recipe anytime. You don’t have to be a kitchen pro to nail this. It's designed for those "I need something simple yet special" times. Southern Italian home cooks have been relying on dishes like this forever—filling, healthy, and coming together in no time. Pretty much perfection.
So, whether you're craving a traditional Italian breakfast or just a satisfying plate of pan-fried greens , this dish is the answer. Easy, fast and super flavorful. It's a real reflection of Neapolitan comfort cooking—seriously good.
To prepare the broccoli rabe and eggs in a pan, start with the sauté: slice a peeled clove of garlic thinly and a fresh chili . Pour a generous drizzle of oil into a non-stick or cast-iron pan and let the garlic and chili sauté over low heat for a few minutes .
Add the frozen broccoli rabe directly and let them stew, slightly increasing the heat . As soon as they are thawed, add a pinch of salt .
Finish cooking the broccoli rabe and, in the meantime, pour the pine nuts into a small pan to toast them .
As soon as the broccoli rabe are cooked, spread them slightly to create two cavities where you will pour the eggs . Let them cook for a few minutes until the egg white is well cooked, while the yolk must remain soft . Pour the pine nuts and season with salt and pepper if you like. Your eggs are ready, serve them hot .
We recommend consuming immediately.
If you don't like spicy, you can omit the chili.
