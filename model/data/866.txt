instructions:
To prepare fried eggs, we recommend using a non-stick skillet. Pour oil to cover the entire bottom . Heat it, then break an egg into a bowl and pour it in . Cook over medium-high heat, occasionally tilting the pan to scoop oil with a spoon and drizzle over the surface .
Continue this way until a white film forms on the surface . In about 2-3 minutes, the fried egg will be ready . Serve as desired with salt and pepper .
It is not recommended to store fried eggs in any form.
Enhance your fried eggs by adding some melty cheese to grate at the end of cooking or some tempting crumbled cooked bacon.
