instructions:
To prepare the chicken breast in the air fryer, first deal with the meat: clean the chicken breasts, then season with oil , salt , and paprika . Massage well to evenly flavor.
Pass the chicken breasts from both sides first in flour , then in beaten eggs , and finally in panko .
Place the breaded chicken breasts in the air fryer (we used a 6-liter capacity fryer) . Close and cook for about 15-20 minutes at 356°F. Meanwhile, prepare the side dish starting with the salad dressing: in a blender, put the spinach and cashews, then add the grated Parmesan cheese and the avocado pulp .
Add the oil and lemon juice , then blend until you obtain a creamy and homogeneous sauce .
Now coarsely chop the lettuce . Slice the cucumbers without peeling them , then cut them into fairly small cubes .
Combine the lettuce and cucumbers in a bowl , then pour the sauce and mix well to combine everything .
Meanwhile, the chicken breasts will be cooked, they should be crispy and golden , then cut them into slices . Plate by placing the side dish at the base of the dish, then place the air fryer chicken breast on top and serve !
It is recommended to consume the air fryer chicken breast immediately.
If you do not have an air fryer, you can bake the chicken breast in the oven at 392°F for about 20-25 minutes (the cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the meat).
