Fregola with seafood is, honestly, a really tasty way to bring the core of the Sardinian coast to your table. This Sardinian pasta is something special because of its rustic, toasted little balls—like a cross between couscous and regular pasta, but with a deeper, slightly nutty flavor. In Sardinia, cooks pick the freshest seafood around, like shrimp, mussels, clams and sometimes calamari. Super tasty stuff. These shellfish are tossed with the fregola as it cooks, so each bite really soaks up the briny, sea-kissed taste. And look, the careful prep matters. You want every piece of seafood to shine, for sure, and nothing should get lost in the mix. What’s great is how flexible this seafood pasta recipe can be—some folks just use whatever shellfish is fresh, and it always turns out to be a celebration of the sea.
