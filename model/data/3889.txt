To prepare bonito en papillote with cherry tomatoes, start by rinsing and halving the cherry tomatoes . Set them aside. Then, take an untreated lemon, wash it, and slice it thinly , dividing each slice in half. Set them aside. Proceed with the fish preparation. Make an incision from the head to the middle of the bonito's belly and gut it. Rinse under running water to remove any blood residues. Salt and pepper the belly of the fish, and place the peeled and chopped garlic clove inside .
Also insert the lemon slices and rosemary , washed and dried, to add flavor. Now take a piece of parchment paper large enough to wrap the bonito. Place the fish in the center and arrange the cherry tomatoes around it .
Salt and pepper. Close the parchment paper wrapping the bonito inside and roll the ends . Seal the ends with some string to hold the parchment paper in place, giving it the typical candy shape.
Transfer the bonito to a baking tray and bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 25 minutes (if using a fan oven, at 356°F for 15 minutes). Once the cooking time has elapsed, remove the bonito from the oven and serve your bonito en papillote with cherry tomatoes on the still-hot parchment paper !
It is preferable to consume bonito en papillote with cherry tomatoes while still warm. However, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
You can also choose to fillet the bonito and bake it this way to better absorb the aromas and flavors of the spices and cherry tomatoes. Since some liquid will be released during cooking, you might also opt to close the parchment with aluminum foil to prevent the liquid from leaking out.
The scientific name of the bonito is “sarda sarda,” although it is called palamitu in the Messinese dialect.
