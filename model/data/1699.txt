instructions:
To prepare the cod with peppers, first cut the already desalted cod fillets into coarse pieces , then take care of the other ingredients needed for the recipe: cut the green pepper in half and remove the seeds and inner filaments, then slice it into strips . Do the same with the other peppers: you will need a total of 150 grams (5.3 oz).
Clean the onion and slice it thinly . Pour the tomato paste into the white wine and stir with a teaspoon to dissolve it completely . Leave the cherry tomatoes whole.
Now heat the oil in a saucepan, add the onion and sauté briefly, then add the cherry tomatoes , the peppers ,
and the mint and basil leaves . Add a pinch of salt, pour in the wine with the tomato paste and the water ,
then cover with the lid and cook over medium heat for about 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, add the cod and stir gently to avoid breaking it .
Cover again with the lid and continue cooking for another 10 minutes, still over medium heat. During this time, avoid stirring to prevent the cod from falling apart, but gently shake the saucepan. After 10 minutes, remove the lid and continue cooking for another 5 minutes . Adjust salt only if necessary as the cod might already be quite salty. Your cod with peppers is ready to be served hot !
Cod with peppers can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days at most. Freezing is not recommended.
If you wish, you can also add eggplants or replace the cherry tomatoes with a diced beefsteak tomato: in this case, add it raw at the end of cooking.
