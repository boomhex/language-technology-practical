instructions:
To prepare the baked gratined squid with cherry tomatoes and olives, first dedicate yourself to cleaning the squid: detach the tentacles from the mantle and remove the cartilage pen inside it . Rinse under running water and use your hands to remove the innards found in the mantle. Use a small knife to cut the end of the mantle and remove the outer skin .
Cut the mantle into rings about 0.8 inches thick . Finally, separate the eye from the tentacles and place them in a bowl along with the squid rings. Now, cut the cherry tomatoes in half and the green olives .
Do the same with the black olives . Add the cherry tomatoes to the bowl with the squid , along with the black and green olives .
Also add the desalted capers , dried oregano , and dried chives .
Season with salt and pepper . Finally, add about three quarters of the breadcrumbs .
Season with about 2 tablespoons of oil , and mix thoroughly to combine the ingredients . Transfer everything onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper , spreading it evenly over the surface.
At this point, sprinkle with the remaining breadcrumbs and the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil . Bake in a static oven at 392°F for 10 minutes, then switch to fan mode, still at 392°F, for another 15 minutes. Your baked gratined squid with cherry tomatoes and olives is ready to be served !
It is recommended to consume the baked gratined squid with cherry tomatoes and olives immediately after preparation.
For an even tastier result, you can replace the fresh cherry tomatoes with sun-dried tomatoes in oil. Additionally, you can enrich the dish with sliced red onions, fresh chili, and grated lemon zest!
