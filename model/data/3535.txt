Colorful layers and cheerful looks make Harlequin cake stand out as one of the most beloved Romanian desserts for families—kids and adults both gravitate to its soft , jam-filled center and playful sponge. Whenever a special event pops up or holidays roll around, this classic Romanian layered cake is usually right at the center of the table, offering sweet flavors with pretty stripes and that festive feeling everyone recognizes. Rich layers, full of vibrant colors and subtle fruity accents from jams, create a nice burst of flavor in each bite. Since this dessert often comes with a moist crumb and a generous finish of crème fraîche icing , families really notice the creamy top layer (and those colorful sprinkles—kids spot them right away). Bright, layered cakes like this one make every get-together a little more fun since that cheerful look announces something DELICIOUS is ready to share.
Busy days or weekend gatherings, Harlequin cake just fits in—definitely a Romanian cake that brings people together. Parents choose it because those fluffy slices are both fun and comforting, while the jam-filled cake approach means you can pull from favorite flavors (apricot jam, plum jam… both winners). Versatile for birthdays, holidays, or relaxed Sunday desserts, it adapts easily to different events by switching up jams or how you decorate with garnished toppings. Serving suggestions tend to be simple—just slice and pile on a plate, or let everyone pick their favorite color stripe—but somehow it always looks neat and good . The pretty appearance and rich layers give it that wow factor, which feels pretty special when you want easy sharing and lots of happy faces around the dessert table. Home bakers appreciate reliable results… this is one traditional cake recipe that keeps families smiling with every slice. If your crowd likes festive cake recipes, chances are they’ll always request this one for another round.
To prepare the harlequin cake, combine the sugar, vanilla bean seeds, and softened butter in a bowl and mix them with an electric mixer. Add the whole eggs at room temperature one by one until they have a creamy consistency .
While continuing to mix, add the lemon and orange zest and mix. Then add the flour , previously sifted baking powder and potato starch, and mix well. Subsequently, pour the milk at room temperature into the batter .
Divide the obtained batter equally into four bowls; leave one with the natural batter and add a pinch of food coloring of different colors to the other three, preferably in powder form. For example, use red, blue, and yellow coloring and mix the powders to obtain different colors. Butter and flour a 7-inch cake pan with high edges (a panettone mold), place a tablespoon of batter in the center , then overlap another tablespoon of batter of another color on top of the first one,
then another one and proceed by placing a spoonful of batter on top of the other until you finish the colored batters. As the colors proceed, the batter will spread , covering the entire diameter of the pan . Bake at 350°F for 50-60 minutes, until a toothpick, when inserted, comes out dry. Let the cake cool, remove it from the mold, and sprinkle it with powdered sugar. To make the harlequin cake even more cheerful, add colorful cake decorations as desired.
