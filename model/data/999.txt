instructions:
To prepare the eggless cookies, first sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl . Add the butter, previously cut into small pieces and not too cold , and the sugar .
Combine the pinch of salt and milk . Quickly mix the ingredients until you have a homogeneous and compact dough .
Form a dough ball and wrap it with plastic wrap , to chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours. Then take the dough and soften it with your hands, add a dusting of flour both on top and underneath the dough to roll it out better with the rolling pin . If necessary, you can wait a moment at room temperature to soften it just enough to work with.
Create a rectangular sheet 3/8 inch thick, measuring approximately 9 1/2 x 6 1/3 inches . With a knife, cut the sheet in half lengthwise, then cut 6 horizontal strips of about 1 1/2 inches , so as to obtain 12 total cookies .
Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper , sprinkle the surface with sugar , and bake in a preheated static oven at 340°F for 25 minutes. Once baked, remove the eggless cookies from the oven and let them cool slightly before enjoying!
Eggless cookies can be stored in a tin box for a week. You can freeze them after baking or, if you prefer, you can freeze the raw dough.
Citrus zest, vanilla, or cinnamon, choose the flavors that will make your eggless cookies even more delicious!
