instructions:
To make the cod fillet with ginger, start with the sauce: grate the lime zest into a bowl , squeeze the juice , and pour 10 grams into the same bowl .
Peel the ginger and grate it , then collect the pulp with a teaspoon and place it in the bowl with the lime, add the olive oil and stir to mix the sauce.
Take the cod fillets and place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, salt , and pepper, then spread the sauce on the surface . Bake in a preheated static oven at 428°F for 25 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the rice: pour the basmati rice into a saucepan, add the coconut milk
the coarse salt , the Thai green curry , and a cinnamon stick .
also pour in the water , cover with the lid and bring to a boil, then lower the heat and let it cook for 15 minutes until the liquids are completely absorbed.
When the rice has absorbed the liquids, turn off the heat and remove the cinnamon stick . Meanwhile, the cod will have finished cooking, take it out of the oven and serve it accompanied by the spiced basmati rice, garnishing with mint leaves .
We recommend consuming the cod fillet with ginger immediately. It is preferable not to freeze the preparation after cooking.
If you do not like spicy notes, you can cook the rice without flavors. As an alternative to lime, you can use lemon.
