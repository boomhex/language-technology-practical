To prepare the lentil and potato meatballs in sauce, first, boil the potatoes . It will take about 30-40 minutes, depending on their size. When the potatoes are almost cooked, pour the pre-drained lentils into a food processor and blend them until you obtain a cream .
Transfer them into a large bowl, and when they are cooked, mash the potatoes inside . Add the grated Grana Padano PDO and the egg .
Then chop the rosemary and add it to the bowl . Mix everything with your hands .
Now add the breadcrumbs and mix . Finally, adjust the salt and pepper .
and a drizzle of oil . Mix everything and set aside, meanwhile, prepare the sauce. Finely chop the shallot and peel the potatoes .
Cut into large cubes of about 1 inch . Now pour a drizzle of oil into a pan and stew the shallot for 7-8 minutes over medium heat. When well stewed, add the potatoes .
Sauté the potatoes for 2 minutes and pour in the tomato puree . Add a little water to dilute the sauce .
Salt, pepper, and mix well . Cover with a lid and let it cook for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, shape the meatballs using about 1 oz of the mixture and form into round shapes .
Continue this way until they are all formed, placing them one by one on a tray . You will get about 25. Once finished, take a non-stick pan, pour a drizzle of oil, and heat it on the stove. Place the meatballs inside and cook them for 4-5 minutes. Using a spatula, turn them gently .
