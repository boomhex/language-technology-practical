So, green soup is this cozy dish from Puglia that people, like, crave after Christmas. Really. Families come together, and this green soup ? It's not just any veggie mix. It's packed with the best winter greens—like cicoria (you know, Italian chicory), tender cardoons, and fresh fennel. And look, these veggies simmer away, soaking up the simple, savory broth, leaving you with that moist and satisfying feeling. Super tasty. Some folks toss in crusty pane pugliese or a bit of pasta, so every spoonful feels creamy without the heaviness. Pretty simple.
In Puglia, they've been making this healthy green soup forever, each family adding their own twist based on what's in the garden or what Nonna's saved up. It's kinda like minestra maritata from Campania, but, you know, more local and homemade. Traditionally enjoyed on Santo Stefano, right after Christmas, it is perfect when you want something light yet comforting. The fennel gives it a sweet note, while those wild greens add an earthy flavor. It's the ultimate plant-based soup for those chilly days.
The simplicity? That's its charm. And real food, cooked with care, and meant for sharing. You do not need to be in Puglia to feel the love. This detox soup brings a piece of Italian winter into your home, using whatever greens you have. Grab a bowl, dip some bread, and you’re part of a big, happy family, even if you’re just chilling at home. Seriously good. There's no need for anything fancy with this delicious soup. Just pure, comforting goodness straight from the heart of Puglia. And the warmth? For sure.

To prepare the Apulian green soup, start with the meat broth: place the various pieces of meat in a large pot, then pour in the water and turn on the medium-high heat. Cover with a lid and let it come to a boil. At that point, you can lower the heat but ensure it continues to simmer. Skim occasionally during the initial cooking phase, about 15-20 minutes .
You can then add the peeled and roughly chopped carrot , celery stalks , and cherry tomatoes .
Cover again with a lid and let it cook for at least 2 hours over medium heat. While the meat broth cooks, prepare the vegetables: remove the end of the cardoon , then peel it to remove the tough and fibrous outer part .
Slice the cardoons . Remove the green part of the fennel , then slice it .
Cut out the cauliflower florets . Remove the ends of the chicory stalks , wash the leaves thoroughly by soaking them several times, frequently changing the water, and then drain well. Do the same with the stalks, removing the ends and cutting them into rough pieces .
Proceed in the same way with the turnip tops: remove the stem ends, roughly chop them, and wash well by soaking, frequently changing the water, then drain well. In another pot with slightly salted boiling water, add the cauliflower and fennel .
Add the cardoon , stalks (Swiss chard), and turnip tops. Let them cook for a couple of minutes, then add the chicory . Cook everything for at least 20 minutes .
Drain the vegetables and set them aside . Also, take the meat out of the broth , leaving the broth in the pot.
Shred the meat , salt the broth to taste , and keep it simmering on the stove to keep it warm .
Empty the pot where the vegetables were cooked, pour in some broth, make a layer of cooked vegetables , then add some meat and a nice sprinkle of cheese .
Continue like this until you run out of vegetables and meat, then cover everything with more broth and finally more grated cheese . In the end, stir and let it cook for another 20 minutes altogether .
Prepare the bread croutons by heating a drizzle of oil in a pan. Toast the croutons until golden brown . The green soup is ready , serve it steaming hot with croutons !
The Apulian green soup can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days in an airtight container.
Freezing is not recommended.
