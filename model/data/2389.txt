To prepare the juice and cake with peels, start by preparing the juice, beginning with the fruit. Wash the apples thoroughly (you can use either Granny Smith or Golden) and remove the core with the appropriate tool , then cut them into slices, without removing the peel . Wash the carrots well and trim them .
Also cut these into chunks of a couple of inches and start How to clean and cut the pineapple . Remove the outer peel and cut it first into 4 pieces and then cut each part into not too small pieces . With the leftover pineapple, you can make a pure pineapple juice or a Pineapple and Mint Sorbet .
At this point, place the fruit in the juicer: the apple pieces and carrot pieces , both with the peel to retain their nutritional properties, and finally the pineapple pieces .
Extract the fruit juice (16.5 oz), setting aside all the leftovers that come out (about 3.5 oz) . Squeeze the lemon separately, strain the juice, and add it to the juice . Mix everything and store your drink and peel scraps in the refrigerator .
In the meantime, focus on preparing the cake. Grease the pan with a little oil and line it with parchment paper . In a large bowl, pour the eggs together with the sugar .
Quickly beat them with a mixer until you have a frothy mixture. Add the grated lemon zest and the vegetable oil .
Mix with a spatula and add the salt . Also add 3.5 oz of juice leftovers and, still mixing with a spatula, incorporate them into the mixture .
Sift the flours , incorporate them into the batter , and also add 2.8 oz of juice while continuing to mix.
Also incorporate the cornstarch and baking powder, both sifted . Mix everything well, still stirring with a spatula, and pour it into the pan (26-27).
Finish by placing the almond flakes on the surface . Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 35-40 minutes (if using a convection oven, 320°F for about 30 minutes). To ensure the cake is cooked, always perform the toothpick test. Let cool , then remove the cake from the mold and serve your juice accompanied by the cake with peels!
You can store your juice in the refrigerator for up to one day, while the cake can be stored under a glass dome for a couple of days. Freezing is not recommended for both.
