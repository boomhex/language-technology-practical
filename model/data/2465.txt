To prepare the scialatielli with nduja, remove the casing from the nduja and place it in a bowl, mashing it with a fork to soften it . Slice the onion
and sauté it over low heat for 6 minutes in a non-stick pan with the oil , adding 50 g of hot water . Then add the nduja in small pieces, distributing it evenly .
Add the remaining hot water and stir with a kitchen spatula so that the nduja melts .
