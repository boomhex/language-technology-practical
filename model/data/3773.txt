Combine the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl. Mix well until you obtain a fluffy and frothy cream, then sift the flour and add it to the cream, mixing well to avoid the formation of lumps.
With the help of a knife, make a lengthwise incision on the vanilla pod. Boil the milk with the vanilla; when the milk reaches a boil, turn off the heat and let it cool. Open the vanilla pod and extract the seeds; mix them with the milk, which you will gradually add to the egg, sugar, and flour cream, stirring continuously.
Return the cream to low heat and stir until it begins to thicken, then fill individual cups with the cream and cover them with plastic wrap; to prevent a crust from forming on the surface, the wrap should touch the cream.
Let it rest in the fridge until serving time, then remove the plastic wrap, sprinkle the surface with sugar, and caramelize it with a gas torch until the sugar becomes golden and crunchy.
For adults only: try giving the crème brûlée a delicious aroma by adding a tablespoon of rum after thickening. If you don't have a gas torch, you can caramelize the sugar under the grill; in this case, use cups suitable for oven cooking and be careful as caramelization happens very quickly.
