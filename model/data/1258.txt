instructions:
To prepare the coconut cookies with a white chocolate heart, put the soft butter in pieces and the sugar in a bowl , beat the ingredients with electric beaters, and then add the eggs, one at a time . Once you have obtained a homogeneous mixture, add the sifted flour .
Continue by adding a pinch of salt and the shredded coconut . Knead by hand to incorporate the powders .
Finally, add the baking powder and mix the dough one last time. Now take a small portion of dough about the size of a walnut, weighing approximately 0.7 oz, form balls with your hands , then create an indentation by pressing with your thumb in the center of the ball .
Stuff with some white chocolate chips, about 0.1 oz , and wrap the filling with the dough , recreating the initial ball .
With the indicated doses, you will get about 29-30 cookies, place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Bake the cookies in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 20 minutes. Once cooking is complete, remove the cookies from the oven , let them cool, and then serve them with a dusting of powdered sugar .
Store the coconut cookies with a white chocolate heart in a tin box for up to a week.
For this recipe, we used white chocolate chips, but alternatively, a bar cut into small cubes will work just fine. This recipe calls for shredded coconut, not to be confused with coconut flour, which has a different consistency in terms of texture.
