instructions:
Place 10.5 oz of already cooked rice in a large bowl along with two small eggs, flour, the grated zest of 1 lemon, a pinch of ground cinnamon, sugar, and previously soaked raisins. Mix the ingredients well until you obtain a soft yet compact mixture, which you will cover and let rest for at least half an hour in a cool place.
Heat a pan with peanut oil and let it become very hot (but not boiling), then immerse spoonfuls of the mixture and form fritters that you will brown on both sides over low heat. When the fritters are perfectly golden, remove them with a slotted spoon and roll them in granulated sugar; serve the rice fritters while still warm.
To prepare the rice fritters, you can use leftover boiled white rice from a previous meal, preferably rich in starch, which will make the fritter batter softer.
