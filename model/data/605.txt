Baked paccheri with ricotta and zucchini flowers brings a real taste of Campania right to your table. Seriously good stuff. Big, tube-shaped paccheri —which people in Naples absolutely love—get stuffed with a creamy mix of ricotta and fresh zucchini flowers. And listen, these flowers aren’t just pretty—they add a light, almost delicate flavor that’s hard to find in other pasta dishes. What makes this dish different from the usual baked pasta is the combo of seasonal ingredients and the way everything comes together in the oven. A layer of silky béchamel covers the stuffed pasta, and after a sprinkle of grated cheese, the whole thing bakes until it’s bubbling and golden. Every bite gives you that cheesy pull and a hit of fresh, springtime flavor from the zucchini flowers. I mean, it really really shows how simple ingredients from Southern Italy can turn into something special.

It’s one of those zucchini flower recipes that shows off the beauty of Italian vegetables in the easiest way. Compared to other vegetarian pasta recipes, this one doesn’t just settle for tomato sauce—it goes for a rich, moist texture thanks to the béchamel and ricotta. There’s nothing heavy or complicated about it, though. Everything about this ricotta stuffed pasta recipe keeps things light, tender, and full of flavor. And you know what, whether you’re into traditional Italian pasta bakes or just want something a little different for a Sunday meal, this dish brings together classic techniques like stuffing and gratinating, which you see all the time in Neapolitan kitchens. And the result? A pasta bake that’s both down-to-earth and a little fancy. For sure. Easy to make but sure to impress everyone at the table. And when you dig into this tasty creation, you’ll really appreciate the balance of flavors that make it a standout dish in any setting. No question.
