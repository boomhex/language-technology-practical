instructions:
To prepare the ricotta and blueberry tart, start with the crust preparation. Pour the cold butter with the flour into a bowl , pinch it quickly with your fingers to avoid warming it too much. You should obtain a sandy mixture. At this point, add the sugar and work it for a few moments.
Add the egg and knead for a short time to compact everything. Form a dough ball and place it between two sheets of parchment paper, pressing it lightly .

Roll it out slightly with a rolling pin , giving it a square shape : let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the blueberry compote: pour the blueberries into a slightly warmed pan and add the sugar . Let it cook over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
When the blueberries have softened and the compote begins to thicken, turn off the heat and add the lemon juice, mix and set aside. Butter and flour a 7-inch ring mold. Take the crust, roll it out to about 3/16 inch thick, and cut it with the mold . Place the cut crust on a baking sheet lined with a silicone mat (or simple parchment paper) .
Also position the mold . With the leftover dough, create the edge: roll it out and cut a strip 1.5 inches wide and the length of the ring (about 23.5 inches) .
Place the strip of crust adhering it well to the ring so that it doesn't wrinkle during baking. Poke the base of the crust with a fork and let it cool in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Prepare the filling: in a bowl, mix together the ricotta, honey, and lemon zest .
Set the cream aside . After the necessary time has passed, fill with the ricotta cream and level with the back of a spoon .

Bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for about 45 minutes. Once baked, let it cool, remove the ring , and transfer to the serving plate .
Pour the quick blueberry compote and decorate with more fresh blueberries and fresh oregano leaves. The ricotta and blueberry tart is ready to be served .
The ricotta and blueberry tart keeps in the refrigerator for 2 days.
The crust keeps for 2-3 days in the fridge, rolled out as shown.

You can replace the ring with a round cake mold 7 inches in diameter with a 1.5-inch high edge.
