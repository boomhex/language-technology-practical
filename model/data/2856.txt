To prepare the ice cream muffins, start with the Stracciatella Ice Cream : in a saucepan, heat the whole milk and cream , then add the sugar and stir to dissolve it: bring the mixture to just below boiling (if you have a thermometer, it should not exceed 181-183°F). Split a vanilla bean lengthwise and extract the seeds, which you can add to the cream and milk mixture along with the bean, to infuse .
Once the mixture has reached the indicated temperature , turn off the heat, remove the vanilla bean , and cool the mixture by pouring it into a cold bowl immersed in another bowl full of ice (or in the same pot immersed in a bowl filled with ice).
Stir the mixture : this operation will immediately cool the cream, maintaining the consistency intact. Place the mixture in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap, and let it cool for at least 2 hours (or 1 hour in the freezer). After the necessary time, pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and turn it on for about 30 minutes. When it has reached the right creamy consistency, transfer it to a bowl and add the chocolate chips .
At this point, gradually add the sifted flour and baking powder, and mix the batter to combine the ingredients (10-11). Stir until you get a smooth and soft cream .
Line a 12-muffin tin with paper liners and pour the ice cream into each one using a sieve or a piping bag with a plain nozzle, filling the liners to the brim . Bake in a preheated static oven at 338°F for about 1 hour (302°F for about 50-55 minutes if using a convection oven). Once baked , remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly before removing them from the tin and serving!
Store the ice cream muffins under a glass dome or in a food bag for 2-3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
You can prepare ice cream muffins with leftover ice cream of different flavors, such as custard, caramel, or berries!
