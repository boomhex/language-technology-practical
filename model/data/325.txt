instructions:
To prepare the roasted guinea fowl, first finely chop 2 peeled garlic cloves, a sprig of rosemary, and 3 sage leaves . Transfer everything to a bowl and season with the oil .
Season with salt and pepper and mix .
Stuff the guinea fowl with two more crushed garlic cloves , three sage leaves , and a sprig of rosemary. Tie the guinea fowl's legs with kitchen string .
Wrap the string around the wings and knot it at the top , this way the guinea fowl will keep its shape during cooking. Place the guinea fowl on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, pour the chopped herbs over the guinea fowl , and massage the meat to distribute the herbs over the entire surface. Bake in a preheated, fan-assisted oven at 356°F for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and cut them into wedges . Remove the seeds and internal filaments from the pumpkin .
Then cut it into 1-inch cubes . Transfer potatoes and pumpkin to a bowl , then season with rosemary .
Season with salt and pepper . Add a sprinkle of nutmeg and the oil . Mix.
Add the vegetables to the baking sheet, along with the guinea fowl , cut the string , and continue cooking under the same conditions for another 40 minutes. Remove from the oven, let the guinea fowl rest for 10 minutes, then plate it. Your roasted guinea fowl is ready to be served !
Roasted guinea fowl keeps in the fridge, in a sealed container, for 2-3 days. Before serving it again, warm it in the oven at low temperature to preserve the flavor without drying out the meat.
For a more intense flavor, you can marinate the guinea fowl for a few hours, or even overnight, with olive oil, white wine, garlic, sage, and rosemary. If you prefer a different side dish, you can replace the potatoes and pumpkin with carrots, onions, or fennel.
