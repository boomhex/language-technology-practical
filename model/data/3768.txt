Big steaming bowl of rib stew sitting on the kitchen table...now that’s what family dinners are all about. Thick, tender pieces of pork ribs make this dish both rich and extra satisfying, and the color when it’s finished is just really nice, especially with all those summer vegetables tucked in alongside the meat. With plenty of flavor built right in, this pork ribs recipe stands out as real comfort food – it looks good, tastes great , and works for any family who likes food that’s filling but not fancy. Since it’s a genuine traditional stew , you’ll spot this on tables all over Latin America on chilly nights, at family gatherings, or during weekend get-togethers when people want something hearty that feels like home. Sometimes it’s about the way soft veggies mix in with the ribs, other times it’s those rich flavors coming together that make folks happy (families usually like how everyone finds their favorite part).
Something cool about this Mexican rib stew – you don’t have to stick to one way or one tradition, so it’s a hit for busy families who like to try new things or switch up their comfort foods. Swapping in fresh veggies for what’s in season, leaning into recipes from Colombian pork stew or adding a little twist from cazuela cooking, you get lots of options. People will notice how it goes really well with simple sides: maybe rice, a nice fresh salad, or just plain and HOT right from the pot…always DELICIOUS and usually leaves everyone talking about how good and filling it was. As far as family meals go, this hearty meal is kind of in its own lane—versatile but still classic, welcoming easy changes while sticking to what works best at the table. Home cooks keep coming back to this easy stew recipe because the results are reliable, the flavors are big, and it just feels right for those big family moments or the little weeknight meals that bring everyone together.
Cut the onion into wedges not too thin; peel the carrot and cut it into slices or large cubes; peel the potatoes and cut them into cubes about 1 inch (3 cm), then peel and finely chop the garlic. In a thick-bottomed pot, sauté the onion with a splash of oil. Add the potatoes, carrots, and garlic and cook them for a few minutes, avoiding browning.
Add the ribs cut across the bones and brown them for two minutes, then incorporate the paprika, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Cover the ingredients with water until it is at least three fingers above them.
Cook over medium heat for 1.5 hours, stirring occasionally. Adjust with salt and pepper and serve hot.
At the end of cooking, for a richer broth, we can mash a few potatoes and carrots with a fork, mixing and incorporating them into the broth. If you desire a slightly different yet equally good taste, try using saffron instead of paprika.
