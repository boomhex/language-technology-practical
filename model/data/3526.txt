and remove any bones with tweezers , then cut it into pieces . Proceed in the same way to clean the perch and cut it into pieces as well. In a non-stick pan, with two tablespoons of oil and one clove of garlic, cook the salmon over moderate heat, deglaze with 1 oz of white wine , then season with salt and pepper
and add the chopped parsley . Cook everything for a few minutes until the salmon is golden, then set it aside . Then cook the perch and the sea bream in the same way, always with two tablespoons of oil and one clove of garlic ,
deglazing with the remaining white wine , adding a generous handful of chopped parsley , and adjusting salt and pepper. Let everything cook for a few minutes over moderate heat, then set the cooked fish aside.
Clean and wash the spinach thoroughly under running water, drain them and sauté for a few minutes, over moderate heat, in a non-stick pan with two tablespoons of oil, three cloves of garlic, and the anchovy fillets . When they are cooked, turn off the heat and keep them aside , but warm. In three different bowls filled with cold water, soak the gelatin sheets: 1 tsp for the salmon, 1 tsp for the sea bream and perch, and 1 1/2 tsp for the spinach .
Using a blender, blend the spinach with the ricotta and, if necessary, adjust salt and pepper. Add the well-wrung gelatin sheets to the still warm spinach mixture and dissolve them thoroughly . Now blend the salmon with 1/2 cup of cream ,
dissolve the gelatin sheets in 1/4 cup of warm cream and mix them into the mixture (19-20). Then blend the perch and sea bream with 1/2 cup of cream
and also add the last 1 tsp of gelatin sheets, dissolved in 1/4 cup of warm cream (22-23). Take a loaf pan of dimensions 10.5x4 inches, line it with parchment paper, and pour the sea bream and perch mixture into it, then let it cool in the freezer for 15-20 minutes before proceeding with the second layer .
When the mixture is cold and solid, proceed by adding the second layer, the spinach one, level it well and put the mixture back in the freezer to firm up for another twenty minutes . Finally, pour the salmon mixture into the mold, level well, and leave in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours . After the indicated time, remove the fish and spinach terrine from the mold and serve chilled .
You can store the fish and spinach terrine in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days, closed in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap. If desired, you can freeze the terrine and then thaw it in the refrigerator.
You can use frozen spinach if you can't find fresh ones and proceed as described in the recipe. Instead of salmon, you can use salmon trout, or a mix of fresh salmon and smoked salmon to further enhance the flavor of this dish. Wait for one layer to be completely cold and compact before proceeding with the next one, otherwise, you won't achieve well-defined layers.
