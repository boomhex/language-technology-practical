It's got tender chicken, earthy mushrooms, and sweet leeks, all tucked into a rich, homemade chicken pot pie . You know when the filling almost melts in your mouth? Yeah, like that. Seriously good. It's cozy and a bit fancy at the same time. Usually, it's baked in a big dish to share, but also, small cocottes work great for individual servings. Special touch, right?

Honestly, it’s perfect for impressing everyone at the table with its classic, crispy crust, while the inside stays so moist and flavorful. And the pastry? It gets that golden finish in the oven. I mean, when you cut into it and the creamy filling spills out—pretty much why it’s a favorite.

No question, the best chicken pot pie recipes are staples in homes that love hearty, satisfying food.
To prepare the chicken pie, start with the preparation of the shortcrust pastry, use the doses indicated above and the procedure you find Easy Shortcrust Pastry Then divide the dough obtained into two parts (one slightly larger than the other) and let the pastry rest in the refrigerator for about an hour. Meanwhile, prepare the pie filling: cut the chicken breast into cubes (as for a stew) , clean the leeks and slice them quite thinly, clean the mushrooms well and slice the larger ones (keep the smaller ones whole) . In a very large pan, heat the extra virgin olive oil, add the sliced leeks
and let them wilt for at least 10 minutes. Then add the chicken , browning it well over high heat on all sides; finally, add the mushrooms . Deglaze with white wine and add salt. Then cook the chicken. In a saucepan, melt the butter, add the flour , stirring with a whisk (as if preparing a Béchamel sauce ),
then add the chicken broth , continuing to stir to avoid lumps. Let it thicken over low heat and then add this mixture to the chicken .
Add the chopped parsley and the fresh cream and stir to thicken the cream . Adjust salt and pepper and let it cool.
Then roll out the two pieces of shortcrust pastry into two sheets about 1/12 inch thick . Butter and flour a ceramic pie dish with a diameter of 9-10 inches, ideally quite deep and with fluted edges. Place the larger sheet on the pie dish , adhering well to the bottom and edges. Take the now cold chicken mixture and pour it into the pie dish , trying to form a 'mountain' in the center.
Then cover with the other sheet of dough . With a knife, remove excess dough from the edges and press them with your fingers to adhere well. Make holes in the center of the pie and brush it with 1 beaten egg . If you want, you can create decorations with the leftover shortcrust pastry scraps. Bake at 375°F for about 50 minutes, until the surface of the pie is golden brown. Let the chicken pie rest for 10 minutes before serving!
Store the chicken pie in the refrigerator, closed in an airtight container, for a maximum of 2-3 days.
The chicken pie is ideal if you have organized a dinner and prefer to be with the guests rather than in the kitchen: you can prepare it the day before and it might even be better, as the flavors will have had time to blend. If you want to go overboard, you can use the leftover shortcrust pastry scraps to create decorations that you will attach to the surface of the pie.
