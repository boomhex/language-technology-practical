To prepare the Roscón de Reyes, start by dissolving the crumbled fresh yeast in a little milk (taken from the total amount provided in the recipe), then set it aside. In a bowl, beat the eggs with the granulated sugar , using an electric mixer, until you get a frothy mixture. In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, place the sifted flour, turn on the device at a moderate speed and add the yeast ,
the remaining milk and the eggs beaten with the sugar . Add the grated zest of an orange and the salt . When the ingredients are well combined, replace the paddle with the dough hook.
Finally, add the softened butter one piece at a time, not adding another until the previous one is absorbed . This operation will take about 15-20 minutes. After this time, transfer the mixture to a lightly floured work surface and knead it just enough to obtain a smooth, elastic, and non-sticky dough . Form a ball and place it in a bowl covered with cling film , then let it rise in a warm, draft-free place (such as the oven turned off and closed but with the light on) for about 4 hours,
or until the mixture has doubled in size . At this point, work the dough to form a ball,
then make a hole in the center with two fingers and widen the hole to create a ring (13-14). Transfer the roscón to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brush it with a beaten egg yolk mixed with 2 tablespoons of cream .
Decorate the surface of the Roscón de Reyes with candied fruit to taste and return it to the turned-off oven to rise for another 2 hours. When the cake has doubled in size , bake it in a static oven at 350°F for at least 30 minutes . Once baked, remove the ring from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack, then dust it with powdered sugar: the Roscón de Reyes is ready!
Store the Roscón de Reyes under a glass dome for up to 3-4 days. It is possible to freeze the Roscón dough after it has risen. When ready to use, defrost it at room temperature and let it rise again until it doubles in size.
This ring-shaped cake is perfect for breakfast or a snack. Try cutting it in half and filling it with whipped cream or chocolate mousse.
Traditionally, when making the Roscón de Reyes, small surprises are hidden inside for the children (a coin, a figurine, earrings...), or a white or black bean. The unlucky one who finds the bean will have to pay for the cake!
