To prepare Morning Bread, start by heating the milk until it's lukewarm. Dissolve the yeast in a little milk taken from the total amount . In a stand mixer fitted with a hook, place the all-purpose flour and bread flour, and add the dissolved yeast in milk and honey .
Also add the sugar and 1 1/2 cups of milk and work the dough for about 3 minutes at low speed. Then add the softened butter at room temperature and increase the hook speed to medium, so that the dough absorbs the butter well.
Finally, add the salt and the remaining milk gradually , kneading for at least 7-8 minutes, until the dough is smooth and homogeneous . Put the dough in a bowl, cover with a clean cloth, and let it rest for at least a couple of hours in an off, closed oven with the light on.
After the necessary time, the dough will have doubled in size . Roll out the dough on a floured surface with a rolling pin, aiming for a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick . To make croissants, cut a strip from the center 6 inches long and 3 inches high and divide it into triangles .
Make a small cut at the base of each triangle and, grabbing the sides, roll the triangle onto itself . Thus, form all the croissants and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and let them rise for another 40-50 minutes, in an off, closed oven.
To form the snail shapes instead, cut strips 3/4 inch wide from the rolled-out dough and roll them into spirals (17-18). Arrange these also on a baking sheet with parchment paper and let them rise for 40-50 minutes.
Beat the egg with milk and after the second rise time, glaze the morning breads by brushing them with a brush ; if you want, sprinkle the surface of the croissants or snail shapes with sugar granules. Bake the morning breads in a preheated static oven at 356°F for 20 minutes, taking care to place a bowl of water at the bottom of the oven. Once the shapes are nicely golden (20-21), remove them and let them cool on a wire rack, so they can cool evenly. Your morning breads are ready: dust them with powdered sugar and fill as desired!
It's best to consume Morning Bread freshly made, but if you have any leftovers, you can keep it under a glass dome for up to two days!
