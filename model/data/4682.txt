To prepare the white chocolate mousse, first, soften the gelatin in a bowl with cold water for about 10 minutes . Chop the white chocolate and melt it in a bain-marie or, if you prefer, in the microwave . Pour the milk into a saucepan, and when it reaches a boil, remove it from the heat and add the well-drained gelatin .
Pour one-third of the milk into the melted white chocolate and when it is well combined, add another third of the milk mixture, stir to incorporate well, and finally add the last third of the remaining milk until you get a homogeneous and smooth mixture. Let it cool at room temperature and in the meantime, whip the very cold cream until you get a frothy consistency. Ensure that the milk and white chocolate mixture has reached a temperature of about 95/113 °F with a kitchen thermometer and incorporate it into the cream, stirring gently from bottom to top . When the mixture is well combined , pour the white chocolate mousse into individual cups of about 2.4 oz and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
