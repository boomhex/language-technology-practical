To prepare the mixed pasta soup with legumes and bay leaf, start by rinsing the legume mix under running water; then soak them overnight . The next day, prepare the Vegetable broth , then drain the legumes, rinse them under running water , and set them aside .
Proceed by peeling the garlic and finely chopping the peeled onion, celery, and carrot . Pour the oil into a saucepan, add the whole peeled garlic, let it brown, then remove it and add the freshly prepared mince . Let it stew for about ten minutes over low heat
In the meantime, tie the bay leaves and rosemary together , making it easier to remove them later. Take the Parmesan rind and scrape off the outermost part with a knife . Once the mince is wilted, add the legume mix and about 900 grams of broth .
Add the tomato puree , the aromatic bouquet, the Parmesan rind , adjust the salt , and mix everything together.
Cover with a lid and let your soup cook for about 1 hour, stirring often. At this point, remove the aromatic herbs and the Parmesan rind .
Pour the remaining part of the broth and wait a few minutes, until it reaches a boil, before adding the pasta . Cook, keeping the pasta al dente , and serve your mixed legume and bay leaf pasta soup still hot!
You can store your soup in an airtight container and keep it in the refrigerator for a maximum of 1 day.
It can be frozen, preferably without pasta, for about 2-3 weeks.
If you prefer, you can create the legume mix with the ones you love the most, just keep one small detail in mind: the various legumes should have the same cooking time.
