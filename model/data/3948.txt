To prepare the passion fruit semifreddo hearts, soak the gelatin sheets in a small bowl with cold water . Then cut 6 passion fruits in half , scoop out the pulp, and strain it to collect the juice (2.4 oz) .
Use a spatula to extract the juice by pressing the seeds well , then pour it into a small saucepan. Heat it slightly, then add the well-squeezed gelatin sheets .
Stir to completely dissolve the gelatin and set aside. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, add the sifted ricotta and the fresh liquid cream ; mix the two ingredients with a hand whisk .
Sift the powdered sugar into the bowl as well and once it is incorporated, pour in the juice in which you dissolved the gelatin . Combine everything with the hand whisk .
Pour the mixture into a small funnel to fill the heart-shaped silicone molds more easily (alternatively use a spoon); then level the surface of the molds with a spatula . Let the mold rest in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours or until fully set.
Before removing the mold from the refrigerator, prepare the passion fruit sauce: cut three passion fruits in half, scoop out the seeds, and strain them to collect the juice (as in steps 2-3-4); pour the juice into a small saucepan and add the powdered sugar . Cook over low heat and stir with a whisk to emulsify. Once ready, let it cool completely. Now that the preparations are ready, you can plate the semifreddo hearts: prepare 6 serving plates, pour some sauce on each, and gently remove the hearts from the mold .
Place the heart on the sauce then let your imagination run wild to decorate the plate with the sauce and passion fruit seeds (20-21).
At this point, you can complete the decoration with original chocolates (we used dark chocolate leaves) and garnish the passion fruit semifreddo hearts with a little sauce and some seeds (23-24).
Store the passion fruit semifreddo hearts in the refrigerator in an airtight container for a maximum of 1-2 days. The sauce can be stored in the refrigerator in a glass jar. Freezing is not recommended.
Why passion fruit? The name "passion fruit" was given by Spanish missionaries who, seeing it for the first time, recognized the symbols of the Passion of Christ: the cross, the sponge, and the nails.
Let's focus on the mold (the shape is indifferent): silicone is a winner because it will help you unmold the semifreddos more easily. If you prefer, when soaking it you can replace the water with rum or maraschino: a little extra aroma never hurts :)
