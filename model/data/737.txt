instructions:
To prepare sausage and potatoes with beer, remove the sausage casing and cut it into pieces of 1.5 inches. Brown the sausage in a pan over medium heat with 1.5 tbsp of oil . Sauté it on all sides .
Peel and cut the potatoes into wedges. Once browned, after 10 minutes, deglaze the sausage with 7 oz of beer and raise the heat. Continue cooking for another 5 minutes in the pan, and once the beer has reduced, remove the sausage from the pan .
Keep the meat warm and in the same pan add the potatoes . Salt, pepper and cook over medium heat for about 20 minutes, occasionally tossing the potatoes to color them on all sides.
Season with oregano and rosemary and another 1.5 tbsp of oil. When the potatoes have that beautiful golden color, deglaze with the remaining beer and let it reduce.
Add the sausage back to the pan and continue cooking for another 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and add more rosemary and oregano . Serve the sausage and potatoes with beer immediately .
We recommend consuming immediately. You can store sausage and potatoes with beer at room temperature if you consume them within a few hours, otherwise keep them in the refrigerator for a maximum of 1-2 days. Freezing is not recommended.
The amber beer has a citrusy and sweet taste, which gives the dish a particular aroma. If you cannot find it, you can substitute it with light beer, though this will result in a less aromatic flavor.
