Burrata salad from Puglia is all about pairing creamy cheese with a colorful mix of grilled veggies and fruit—perfect for warm nights. Burrata from Southern Italy, with its rich, moist center, is the star. And when you cut into it? The cheese just flows all over the plate, mingling with the flavors. And Grilled vegetables like radicchio and Belgian endive turn tender and crispy. Really good stuff. Baby spinach keeps it light. Slices of apple and sweet persimmon add an unexpected sweet bite. A classic Puglian move. A drizzle of extra virgin olive oil with fresh basil and thyme gives it that true Mediterranean vibe. Tastes like summer down south.
