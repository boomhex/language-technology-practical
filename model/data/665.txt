To prepare the pan-fried savoy cabbage, first peel the onion , finely chop it , and set it aside. Move on to the savoy cabbage. Remove any damaged outer leaves, wash it well under running water, and cut it in half with a sharp knife .
Then cut it into strips, discarding the harder central part. In a fairly large pan, pour the extra virgin olive oil and onion . Let it soften over medium heat, then add the savoy cabbage .
Pour in the hot broth , cover with a lid , and cook for 10 minutes, stirring several times. Remove the lid, and season with salt .
Add some pepper , pour in the Taggiasca olives , and continue cooking until the broth has evaporated . Serve the savoy cabbage hot with an abundant sprinkle of pepper.
The pan-fried savoy cabbage can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days. If you like, you can freeze it in containers and then thaw it when needed.
Add a pinch of chili pepper to the onion sauté!
