Since delights never come alone, why not accompany this tarte tatin with some delicacy, for example, a smooth cheese sauce, perhaps with Grana Padano or goat cheese, or even a light béchamel? If you miss a bit of crunchiness, we suggest working on the filling: you could add some cubes or strips of bacon or speck. We don't even have to tell you that you can use whichever mushrooms you prefer, right? :)
