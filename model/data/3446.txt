To prepare pasta with fava beans, bacon, and cherry tomatoes, first shell the fresh fava beans by splitting the pod in half and extracting the seeds . Then remove the growth covering the fava bean seeds . Blanch the fava beans in plenty of salted boiling water for 4 minutes , drain them, and cool them under running water. Set aside some of the fava bean cooking water that can be used to mix the pasta sauce.
Now put the bacon, cut into strips, in a pan with a chopped spring onion and a drizzle of oil and cook until the bacon has released its fat and become very crispy . At this point, remove the bacon from the pan and let it dry on a paper towel .
Transfer the fava beans to the pan where you cooked the bacon and cook for 3 minutes ; add the cherry tomatoes cut in half , continue cooking, mixing well, trying to break the cherry tomatoes so that they release their juice. Meanwhile, prepare the water for the pasta, bring it to a boil, add the pasta, and drain it al dente .
Add the bacon to the fava beans and cherry tomato sauce and sauté all the ingredients for another 5 minutes , adding some fava bean cooking water if it is too dry. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, being careful not to oversalt because the pecorino cheese will also add flavor. Add the pasta to the pan , mix the entire preparation, and finish with a drizzle of olive oil, a little finely chopped thyme, and finally grated pecorino cheese . Mix well and serve immediately.
You can also prepare a vegetarian version of this dish by eliminating the bacon from the ingredients.
