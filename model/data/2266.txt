instructions:
To prepare the salmon fillet with green pepper, ginger, and lime, start by making the accompanying sauce. First, peel the ginger , then pour the sour cream into a saucepan , let it heat for a moment over high heat, and deglaze with the brandy .
Add the grated ginger , a pinch of salt , stir to combine the ingredients and turn off the heat. Your sour cream sauce is now ready , set it aside until ready to serve.
Pour the green pepper into a mortar and crush it until it is powdered (alternatively, you can use the bottom of a glass to crush it). Take the salmon fillet and use tweezers to remove any bones ; to find them, simply run your fingers over the fillet. If your fillet has skin, remove it with a very sharp knife.
At this point, cut the fillet into 4 portions and sprinkle them with the freshly ground green pepper . Then cook the salmon pieces on a hot grill for about 5-6 minutes, turning them only once halfway through cooking.
Once cooked , place the salmon fillets on a plate and salt them .
Then, flavor with freshly grated lime zest . If you prefer, you can cut the fillets in half for a more balanced presentation. Serve your salmon fillets with green pepper, ginger, and lime along with the sour cream sauce !
It is advisable to consume the salmon fillets as soon as they are prepared; alternatively, they can be kept for a maximum of one day in the refrigerator.
Freezing is not recommended.
For a drier and less sweet taste, try deglazing your sour cream sauce with Gin instead of Brandy!
