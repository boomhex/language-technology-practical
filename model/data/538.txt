instructions:
To prepare the black cabbage and borlotti bean farinata, first remove the stalk from the black cabbage and slice it thinly . Clean carrots, celery, and onion, and finely chop them for the sauté . Heat a swirl of oil in a high-sided pot with garlic .
Add the vegetables , chili pepper , and a few sage leaves. Let it wilt and then remove the garlic .
Add the cabbage , let it soften for a few minutes, then pour in the tomato sauce and tomato paste. Extend with broth until covered . Cook for about 30 minutes and adjust with salt and pepper.
Also incorporate the drained beans and continue for another 30 minutes. At this point, add the cornmeal for instant polenta and cook until it is absorbed . Once the farinata reaches a thick consistency, it will be ready . Serve it hot with a drizzle of raw oil.
The black cabbage and borlotti bean farinata can be kept in the fridge for a couple of days. We do not recommend freezing.
The amount of cornmeal can vary depending on the desired consistency: if you prefer a more liquid soup, just reduce the dosage; increasing it will result in a rather compact soup. Don't throw away the discarded cabbage stalks but reuse them for a puree or broth. If you don't have fresh chili, you can use powder.
