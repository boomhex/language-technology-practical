instructions:
First, take care of preparing your piece of meat: place it on a cutting board and arrange the bacon slices lengthwise on the roast until the entire surface is covered . Then proceed to tie the roast, How to tie a roast to see how, and add the sprig of rosemary .
In a sufficiently large pan, sauté the finely chopped onion with the oil and butter. When the onion becomes translucent, add the roast wrapped in bacon , and let it brown by turning it on each side for five minutes. Once it is seared, add the vinegar
and season with pepper and salt to taste , also flavor with some nutmeg. Then pour in the cream , dilute with a little broth, and let the roast cook by closing the pan with a lid .
Let it cook for just over an hour (to understand if your roast is cooked, prick it with a toothpick: if a white liquid comes out, it will be perfectly cooked, if the liquid is pink then the meat needs more cooking time), then remove the roast from the pan and keep it warm , perhaps covering it with a bowl. Then thicken the cooking sauce and strain it with a strainer . At this point, cut the roast into slices and drizzle each slice with the cooking sauce.
Store the roast with cream in an airtight container in the refrigerator for no more than 2-3 days.
Cooking is essential: after about 30 minutes, remember to turn your roast so that it browns evenly on both sides. Occasionally shake the pan in which it is contained to prevent it from sticking to the bottom. I absolutely recommend serving this dish with roasted potatoes or mashed potatoes, something that can absorb the cooking sauce.
