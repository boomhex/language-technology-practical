instructions:
To prepare the ricotta and pear fritters, first lightly warm the milk in a saucepan; it should be lukewarm. Add the yeast and stir with a teaspoon until it's completely dissolved. Pour it into a large bowl, add the sugar
and the flour in 3-4 additions , stirring gradually with a whisk , to obtain a thick batter free of lumps. Also add the ricotta ,
a pinch of salt and mix with the whisk . Peel the pear ,
cut it into wedges and remove the central core . Then cut the pear into cubes and transfer them into the batter .
Mix well to combine everything and cover with plastic wrap . Let it rise in the oven turned off with just the light on for 2 hours . Once the dough has risen, heat the seed oil in a saucepan until it reaches a temperature of 338°F. At this point, take a spoonful of batter and pour it into the hot oil, using another spoon to help it slide off .
Fry 4-5 fritters at a time , turning them often. When they are well golden, about 5 minutes, drain them and transfer them to a tray lined with kitchen paper .
Continue this way until all fritters are fried . Roll the still-warm ricotta and pear fritters in sugar and serve them .
We recommend consuming the fritters immediately. Alternatively, you can store them for a few hours under a glass dome.
You can flavor the ricotta and pear fritters with a sprinkle of cinnamon or add to the dough, after rising, 1/3 cup of soaked and drained raisins or the same weight of chocolate chips, or 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts.
