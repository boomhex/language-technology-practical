When you’re on the hunt for something crispy and elegant for your next gathering, these mini cornetti salati are really a game-changer. Made with kataifi pastry —which is awesome—a type of shredded phyllo dough you often see in Greek desserts, these little bites transform into a golden, super crunchy shell that's both light and satisfying.
Plus, they’re pretty simple and don’t take much time at all. Inside, you’ll find salmone affumicato marinated with lemon and creamy stracchino , creating a blend of fresh seafood and smooth cheese. It's a combo that’s sure to be the talk of any party. These appetizers leave a lasting impression, for sure.
For a stunning presentation, serve these mini cornetti salati in small glasses or arranged on a board—looks like a restaurant, honestly. The tender salmon gets this zesty kick from the lemon, while the stracchino makes each bite moist and rich. And the best part? The kataifi stays crispy even after filling, unlike many other stuffed appetizers. Really, it works great.
If you're bored with the usual snacks—mini sandwiches or chips—these are a fantastic way to mix things up. The Greek influence of the kataifi dough adds a distinctive twist that makes them way way different.
So here's the thing: if you want an exciting appetizer that’s easy to enjoy and sure to impress, these mini cornetti are just the thing. Each bite offers a unique taste of salmone affumicato with a gentle tang from the stracchino —a combination that really really works, especially when you want your party snacks to stand out. These mini delights are perfect for creating memorable moments with friends and family, making them a must-have for any occasion. Seriously good.
To make the mini savory croissants with salmon and stracchino, unravel the kataifi dough and create a sort of ribbon then take steel cones and brush them with butter, wrap the phyllo dough strip around the cone starting from the pointed end of the cone moving towards the wider part .
Brush the dough with beaten egg . Fry in hot seed oil at 338°F (for optimal cooking, use a food thermometer), until golden brown (about 3 minutes), then drain the croissants using kitchen tongs and place them to dry on a tray lined with absorbent paper. Prepare the salmon: if you are certain you've purchased Norwegian salmon, no further precautions are needed. Otherwise, ensure you've purchased frozen fish and freeze it for at least 96 hours at 0°F before using it in the recipe: remove bones with tweezers .
Cut 8 slices from the fillet, cutting diagonally , place the slices in a wide dish without overlapping , and sprinkle salt and sugar over the surface .
Then drizzle with lemon juice , cover with plastic wrap, and store the marinated salmon in the refrigerator. Meanwhile, prepare the cream: place the stracchino in a mixer with blades , season with salt, pepper .
Blend until creamy, then add black and white sesame seeds , and mix to flavor. Transfer the obtained cream into a pastry bag with a star nozzle .
Squeeze a tuft of cream inside each mini croissant , take the salmon slices and roll them to form petals , place a petal on top of each croissant .
Then squeeze another tuft of cream in the center to seal . Transfer the croissants into narrow glasses, liquor glasses will do , and then serve your mini croissants with salmon and stracchino on a serving plate garnished with sprigs of fresh thyme .
Store the mini croissants in the refrigerator for up to one day; freezing is not recommended.
If you don't like stracchino, you can use another fresh spreadable cheese of your choice, flavored with herbs such as marjoram or mint, it's up to you!
