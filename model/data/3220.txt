If you’re on the hunt for something different from the usual cheesecake, then you’ve gotta check out the Tarte au fromage blanc from Alsace-Lorraine. It’s seriously something else. This French cheesecake is lighter and fluffier than the New York kind. I mean, really light. The secret? The fromage blanc cheese. It's packed with calcium and protein, making the tart creamy without being heavy. For real. Locals often go for puff pastry as the base. It adds this awesome crisp texture.
The filling is a delicious mix of fromage blanc with eggs, sugar, vanilla, and lemon zest. When you bake it, your kitchen smells amazing. No kidding. That lemon zest gives it a fresh touch, making the tart smell as good as it tastes. And the taste? Super, super good.
On weekends, you’ll see families enjoying this fromage blanc tart , especially when it's fresh and warm out of the oven. The tart puffs up with a golden top but cools into something soft and airy. Which is great. And it doesn’t need any fancy toppings because the filling nails that tender and sweet balance.
Many folks swear it’s the best Alsace dessert to enjoy with coffee or tea. Plus, it’s quick and easy to make when you’re craving something homemade without the fuss. This fromage blanc dessert totally captures that classic French baking vibe—simple, a bit rustic, and honestly, delicious. If you’re curious about European cheesecakes, give this one a try. It’s lighter than most, making it refreshing—perfect for spring or summer. So why not give it a whirl and bring a little taste of France to your home? Seriously, you won't regret it.
To prepare the tarte au fromage blanc, take a ceramic (or non-stick) baking dish with a diameter of 9.5 inches and line it with parchment paper cut to a 12-inch circle, wet it and squeeze it well. Dry the paper by dabbing it with a dry, clean cloth, then place it inside the dish so that it adheres well. Lay the puff pastry in the dish and line the dish, making the pastry adhere to the sides . Prick the bottom with a fork and place everything in the refrigerator.
Move on to the filling: in a large bowl place the fromage blanc , the egg yolks , the grated zest of an untreated lemon .
Cut the vanilla pod in half and scrape the seeds with the tip of a knife , then add them to the other ingredients . Finally, add cornstarch, salt, and cream to the bowl .
Mix everything with the beaters of an electric mixer or stand mixer until you obtain a smooth and creamy mixture . Separately, beat the egg whites with sugar (11-12):
the egg whites should be glossy, not stiff peaks, but still soft and creamy . Gently incorporate them into the fromage blanc mixture , mixing from bottom to top .
Pour everything into the puff pastry base, filling the mold to 3/4 of its height (16-17) and bake the tarte au fromage blanc in a static oven for about 1 hour at 356°F, until the surface of the cake is well golden . Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack: your tarte au fromage blanc can be served warm or cold!
The tarte au fromage blanc can be stored in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap or foil, for 3 days. Freezing is not recommended.
Fromage blanc is low in fat and is consumed both plain and in sweet and savory versions, enriched with sugar or chives. Its slightly tart flavor and firmness are somewhat reminiscent of Greek yogurt: in fact, fromage blanc is obtained by removing the whey from the yogurt.
Delicious on its own, the tarte au fromage blanc is incredibly good even when accompanied: with some blackcurrant compote, for example, with honey, or with your favorite jam. As for the fromage blanc: if you can't find it at the supermarket, don't panic. Replace it with Greek yogurt (the firmest you can find and fat-free) or with a mixture of 10.5 oz of ricotta and 10.5 oz of firm Greek yogurt.
