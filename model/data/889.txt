instructions:
To prepare the mantou, pour the water into the bowl of a stand mixer equipped with a hook , add the dry yeast , and briefly stir with a spoon to dissolve it .
Add the wheat flour and the sugar , and turn on the stand mixer at the lowest speed for 5-6 minutes .
When the mixture becomes compact , transfer it to a lightly floured work surface and knead it briefly to give it a round and smooth shape . Place the dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap , and let it rest at room temperature for about 40 minutes.
After the rising time , transfer the dough to a work surface sprinkled with a little flour and flatten it slightly with your fingers. Divide the dough into 3 portions with the help of a dough scraper , then form into logs .
Trim the ends of the logs with the scraper, then cut them into pieces weighing about 30-40 grams . Straighten the edges of the dough to obtain a rectangular shape, then place each piece on a square of parchment paper . Transfer the buns with their parchment paper base to a tray, cover with plastic wrap, and let them rise at room temperature for another 40 minutes .
After this time, you're ready for cooking : bring the water to a boil in the steamer, place the buns inside, and close with the lid. Cook for 8-9 minutes, then turn off the heat and let them rest closed with the lid for a couple of minutes: this way the dough won't crack but will remain smooth . Serve your mantou in the typical bamboo basket !
Mantou can be stored for 1-2 days, sealed in a plastic bag. You can freeze them before cooking, making sure to thaw them in the refrigerator before cooking.
Wheat flour is a very refined, white-colored flour that can be purchased in ethnic grocery stores: if you can't find it, you can use all-purpose flour.
