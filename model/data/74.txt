instructions:
To make the risotto with Romanesco broccoli, pomegranate, and kefir, first, prepare the Vegetable broth following our recipe. Clean the Romanesco broccoli: with a sharp knife, remove the outer leaves and the tougher base , then cut the top into pieces of the same size .
Boil the broccoli in the vegetable broth brought to a boil and let it cook until tender but still a bright green . Drain the broccoli with a slotted spoon and transfer half of it to a tall container , keeping the cooking broth aside.
Add a ladle of hot broth , a pinch of salt , and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil .
Blend with an immersion blender until smooth and velvety . Meanwhile, take care of the pomegranate: score it along the circumference with a knife and open it into four wedges .
With your fingers, gently detach the seeds, collecting them in a bowl ; set them aside for the final decoration. Now focus on the risotto: heat a large saucepan and pour the rice in dry for toasting . Stir for 2 or 3 minutes until the grains become translucent and start to release their aroma, then add salt .
Deglaze with white wine , letting the alcohol completely evaporate. At this point, begin to gradually moisten the rice with the hot broth , one ladle at a time, stirring occasionally and letting it be absorbed before adding more. Halfway through cooking, add the Romanesco broccoli cream .
Add the other half of the broccoli in pieces and mix thoroughly, continuing to cook until you get a soft and creamy risotto, but with grains still al dente. Off the heat, finish with the butter and grated Parmigiano Reggiano , then stir vigorously. Cover and let rest for a minute, allowing the risotto to become even more velvety.
Distribute the risotto onto plates and complete each portion with a spoonful of kefir and a handful of pomegranate seeds . Serve your risotto with Romanesco broccoli, pomegranate, and kefir immediately, nice and hot!
We recommend consuming the risotto with Romanesco broccoli, pomegranate, and kefir immediately.
You can prepare the Romanesco broccoli cream in advance and store it in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.
You can replace the butter with a spoonful of creamy spreadable cheese: it adds body and a slight acidity, in line with the kefir.
