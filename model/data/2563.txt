Cestini di pasta fillo con cremoso di cioccolato bianco e confettura di frutti di bosco are these really fun and tasty phyllo pastry cups that kinda just light up any table. We're talking about a mix of super crispy filo pastry and a soft, smooth white chocolate cream inside. And on top, there’s this tangy mixed berry jam that just really really wakes up your taste buds. Seriously good stuff. The result? A bite that’s light but rich, with the perfect balance of sweetness and berry flavor, which is great because it keeps things from getting too heavy.
You know, the texture is such a big part of the appeal—the flaky pastry crunches satisfyingly when you bite in, while the creamy center and jam just melt together. People love these because they feel kinda fancy but are actually one of those easy dessert recipes that don’t need much fuss. Plus, using phyllo pastry cups instead of something heavier means they won't leave you feeling too full after dinner.
One of the cool things about these is their versatility. Some folks swap the berries for a homemade berry compote or fresh red berries, and it still turns out perfectly. You’ll often see these as holiday desserts because they look elegant and taste even better, for real. But honestly, they’re great anytime you want something a little different from the usual no-bake desserts or cakes. The combo of white chocolate mousse with tender fruit filling is what keeps people coming back for more.
And you know what, if you’re looking to change things up, you can use the same idea to create a soft tart—just lay down a golden filo base, add your cream and berries, and you're set. For anyone hunting for quick dessert ideas or hoping to impress with something sweet and kinda crispy, these mini dessert cups are always a hit. They hit that sweet spot where fancy meets simple, making them a go-to choice for anyone who loves good desserts with great textures. Pretty simple.
To prepare the phyllo pastry baskets with creamy white chocolate and berry jam, soak the gelatin sheets in a bowl of cold water . In a saucepan, pour the milk and cream , then slice the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with a knife; add the seeds and vanilla bean to the milk and cream , heating until it reaches a boil.
In a separate bowl, beat the 2 egg yolks with the sugar and sifted corn starch . Mix with the beaters until the eggs and sugar are well combined .
When the milk and cream are about to boil , turn off the heat and remove the vanilla bean that you left to infuse. Then, slowly pour the hot milk and cream mixture into the egg mixture, filtering it with a sieve and continue with the beaters to mix the ingredients well .
Place the mixture you've obtained in a bowl and heat it in a double boiler, mixing well with the beaters and ensuring that the hot water in the pot doesn't touch the bottom of the bowl. Bring the mixture to 185°F, checking the temperature with a kitchen thermometer . Once it reaches the temperature, turn off the heat and transfer the cream to a large bowl, filtering it with a fine mesh sieve . Squeeze the gelatin sheets (which will have softened) and add them to the cream .
Mix with the beaters until the gelatin has melted , then finely chop the white chocolate , melting it in a double boiler .
Once the chocolate has melted, add it to the cream, mixing with the beaters . When you achieve a smooth and homogeneous consistency, pour the cream you obtained into a container and cover with plastic wrap in contact ; let it cool at room temperature (to speed up the process, place the cream in a bowl full of ice) and then put it in the refrigerator. When the cream has completely cooled, if you wish, you can pour it into a piping bag without a nozzle, making a hole, always storing it in the refrigerator until using. Meanwhile, prepare the baskets: take 4 phyllo pastry sheets measuring 19x10 inches. With a knife cut 6 equal squares measuring 5 inches .
Melt the butter in a saucepan or microwave; line 6 aluminum molds measuring 3.5 inches with one phyllo sheet at a time, pressing it well to adhere to the mold and form a cup : remember that phyllo pastry is very delicate, so be careful not to puncture the bottom to avoid leakage during baking. Brush with melted butter between each layer and continue : you need to overlap 4 phyllo sheets for each mold; you can decide to fold the corners of the basket or leave them out as decoration.
Once finished , place another mold inside , pressing slightly with your fingers to form a basket shape. Bake on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper in a preheated static oven at 390°F for 10 minutes (or 355°F for 8 minutes if using a convection oven), leaving the 2 molds stacked. Then remove the inner molds and bake at the same temperature for another 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, wash the berries, which will be used as garnish, under plenty of fresh running water. When the baskets are ready, unmold them and let them cool completely . Now you can assemble your desserts: fill the bottom with berry jam ,
then pour in the creamy white chocolate. Finish by adding the berries to taste and a mint leaf ; your phyllo pastry baskets with creamy white chocolate and berry jam are ready .
Store the filled phyllo baskets in the refrigerator for a maximum of 1-2 days. Freezing phyllo pastry that has already been frozen is not recommended. If you have any left, you can store the white chocolate cream in the refrigerator for a maximum of 2-3 days, covered with plastic wrap. It can be frozen for a month.
If you wish, you can make your creamy filling by choosing milk chocolate instead of white chocolate: I'm sure it will be a hit!
