instructions:
To prepare the cuzzetiello alla parmigiana, first slice the eggplants to a thickness of 0.5-1 inch . Pat them dry well and fry in peanut oil at about 340°F for 2-3 minutes. Fry a little at a time to avoid lowering the oil temperature too much. Then transfer them to paper towels to remove excess oil, add a pinch of salt, and set aside.
In a pot, pour olive oil, add the basil stems, the halved garlic, and sauté for a few minutes. Add the tomato puree , basil , season with salt, and cook over medium heat for about 30-40 minutes. At the end of cooking, remove the garlic and basil stems. Meanwhile, slice the mozzarella .
Let it drain on paper towels . Cut the ends off the loaves to obtain 4 pieces of about 6 oz each, then hollow them out . At this point, you can fill the cuzzetielli starting with the sauce .
Continue with a slice of eggplant , a slice of mozzarella , and more sauce .
Complete the first layer with a basil leaf . Make two more layers following the same order by closing the cuzzetielli with a slice of eggplant and place them in a baking dish. Bake in a static oven at 390°F for 5 minutes. Your cuzzetiello alla parmigiana is ready to be enjoyed !
The cuzzetiello alla parmigiana should be consumed as soon as it's ready.
You can substitute mozzarella with provola, or add cooked ham for a richer version. If you want a fresher and summer-filled option, try replacing mozzarella with stracciatella or burrata.
