instructions:
To prepare the pasta with parsley pesto and speck, bring some water to a boil and salt it to cook the pasta. Start with the parsley pesto: wash the bunch of parsley, remove the leaves and place them in a blender ; then pour in the salt , the pine nuts
the almonds and the grated Parmesan . Add a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil taken from the total amount and pulse the blades several times.
Stop the blades and add the remaining amount of extra virgin olive oil and blend again until you get a smooth pesto . The pesto is ready in about 4-5 minutes. Now you can cook the pasta
and in the meantime take the speck, cut it into slices about 0.4 inches thick and then into cubes . Heat 1.5 tablespoons of oil in a pan, add the speck .
Sauté for a few minutes , then add the pesto . Stir quickly and turn off the heat .
Drain the pasta (keep a little cooking water aside if needed) and add it to the sauce in the pan (16-17). If necessary to make everything creamier, add a little pasta cooking water. Serve your pasta with parsley pesto and speck immediately .
To make the pesto creamier, you can add some spreadable cheese or crescenza cheese to mix with the pesto once it's ready.
If you have leftover parsley pesto, you can store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 1-2 days, covered with oil. You can freeze it in suitable containers, even single portions.
