To prepare bigoli with clams on a bed of artichoke cream, start by preparing the artichoke cream: clean the artichokes by rubbing them with lemon and keep them soaked in water and lemon. In another pot, fry a clove of garlic and a tablespoon of oil. Squeeze the artichokes and place some chopped parsley and a pinch of salt in the center (if using another type of artichokes, cut them into quarters removing the central choke and the tougher outer leaves . Put them in the pot with a ladle of vegetable broth , cover them and cook until tender. Then blend them to obtain a sufficiently thick cream .
Open the clams in a covered pot and filter their water . Then remove them from the shells. Wash the tomatoes and cut them into pieces .
In a pan, brown the white onion from Chioggia in a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, deglazing with a little white wine . Then add the chopped clams and Cavallino tomatoes .
Cook until the clams become tender, adding their water as needed and salt. Bring salted water to a boil and cook the bigoli until al dente. Drain them and toss them in the sauce with the clams . Then add a handful of chopped parsley . Finally, plate the dish by placing the artichoke cream at the bottom of the plates and a tuft of bigoli.
To make this recipe, you can use artichoke hearts (with or without thorns) and cherry tomatoes.
