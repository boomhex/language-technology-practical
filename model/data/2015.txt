Rediscovering these authentic Italian recipes brings a piece of the region's warmth right to your table. And honestly? It's a genuine taste of Italy's culinary heartland.
To make the brustengo, first prepare the batter: pour the flour into a bowl and add a pinch of salt , then pour in the water slowly while stirring with a whisk to prevent lumps until you obtain a fluid and homogeneous mixture .
Place a non-stick pan about 10 inches in diameter on the stove, heat the extra virgin olive oil and add the water and flour mixture with a ladle ; evenly distribute the batter over the entire surface and cook over medium heat for about 10 minutes .
After 10 minutes, gently lift the edges with a spatula to check that the underside is cooked , then flip the brustengo and cook it on the other side for 4-5 minutes . Once cooked, transfer the brustengo to a cutting board .
and immediately sprinkle the surface with grated pecorino cheese . Cut it into 8 slices and serve it hot accompanied by Norcia raw ham: your brustengo is ready to be enjoyed !
It is recommended to serve the brustengo fresh. Alternatively, you can store it in the refrigerator for 1-2 days, or up to 2-3 days if you haven't added cheese, and then reheat it in a pan before serving. If necessary, you can slice the brustengo and freeze it without toppings.
The brustengo is even better when accompanied by typical products of its region, but if you wish, you can flavor it with another type of cheese like Parmesan and serve it with your favorite cold cuts!
