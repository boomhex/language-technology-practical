instructions:
To prepare the wild boar stew, first cut the meat into slices and then into pieces . Also slice the onion, previously peeled .
In a saucepan, pour the oil, add the meat and brown over medium-high heat until golden. Remove the meat and set it aside. In the same saucepan, add the onion .
Also add the crushed garlic cloves with skin, bay leaf, and rosemary . Sauté until the onions become transparent; if necessary, add a bit more oil. Add the meat , stir, and cook for a few minutes. Add the tomato paste .
Pour in the tomato puree , stir and cook for 2 minutes. Add the wine and let all the alcohol evaporate. Finally, add the meat broth and bring to a boil.
Adjust with salt and pepper . Stir, cover with a lid , reduce the heat to low, and cook for about 3 hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender. If necessary, to extend the cooking time, you can add water or more broth. Plate and garnish with a bay leaf. Your wild boar stew is ready to be enjoyed hot !
Wild boar stew can be stored in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for 2-3 days. To maintain its texture, reheat it over a low flame, adding a bit of broth or water if the sauce turns out too thick.
If you have time, before cooking, marinate the meat for a few hours with red wine, juniper berries, garlic, and rosemary. This will help tenderize the meat and enhance its flavors.
If you love spice, add chili pepper or smoked paprika.
