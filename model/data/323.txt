Paella with shrimp , calamari , and Iberico pork really captures the heart of Spanish cuisine . It draws from traditional Valencian paella —with a twist. And look, adding grilled Iberico pork gives it something special alongside the seafood. Imagine this: the tender bite of shrimp, crispy calamari, and marinated pork grilled to perfection. A homemade broth ties it all together, and you get this rich, layered taste typical of Spanish rice dishes. The saffron rice just soaks it up. Plus, when you add creamy aioli, each bite becomes an explosion of flavor. It's amazing, honestly.
In Spain—especially around Valencia—mixing pork and seafood is pretty much standard. The tender Iberico pork complements the crispy calamari, while the shrimp offers a sweet and slightly briny punch, essential to any shrimp paella . This dish has sparked variations all over the Mediterranean, like Sardinia’s "paella algherese," but its roots? Definitely Spanish. Every region in Spain throws in its own twist. Some keep it classic with rabbit and chicken, others go wild with seafood. But here's the deal: a good Iberico pork paella brings people together for a leisurely meal. It is about slowing down, savoring the moment—super important—and enjoying something golden and tangy with friends.
