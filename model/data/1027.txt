instructions:
To prepare the red pepper hummus, let's start with the peppers. Wash them, dry them, and place them with the whole garlic cloves on a baking sheet lined with wet and wrung-out parchment paper; transfer them to a preheated oven at 400°F for 30 minutes and let them roast on all sides until the skin begins to peel away .
Transfer the cooked peppers to a bowl , cover them with plastic wrap , and let them cool; this will make them easier to peel .
Now that the peppers have cooled, peel them and remove the inner filaments and seeds . Cut them into strips .
and let them drain in a colander . Also peel the roasted garlic cloves and after a few minutes, pour into the mixer glass the peppers, drained and rinsed chickpeas ,
the garlic cloves , tahini , lemon juice ,
salt, pepper, a drizzle of oil , and paprika , and now blend until you achieve a smooth and homogeneous sauce .
Transfer the sauce to a bowl , sprinkle it with chopped parsley , a drizzle of oil, and a dusting of paprika .
Quickly toast slices of bread, either in a pan or in the oven, and rub them with a garlic clove , then season with oil, salt, and ground chili pepper . Ready to accompany your red pepper hummus .
You can store the red pepper hummus in the refrigerator, well-covered, for 2-3 days.
It would be better not to freeze it.
Enhance the aroma of your red pepper hummus with mint leaves. Instead of pre-cooked chickpeas, you can use dried ones: soak them for 12 hours, use 4.5 oz, and boil them until tender but not overcooked. Tahini is a sesame seed paste, you can make it yourself by following the traditional Hummus guide if you can't find it.
