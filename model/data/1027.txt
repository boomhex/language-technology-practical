Homemade macaroni is all about bringing a bit of that Italian vibe right to your kitchen. Really. And here’s the thing—it’s not just one single thing. And it changes up depending on where you are in Italy. In Emilia Romagna, for example, homemade macaroni often means those neat little tubes. You know, rolled and cut on a wooden comb. Which is great, because it gives them that cool, ridged texture that really really holds onto sauce.
And over in Lazio, maccheroni a matassa twists and loops into thick, rope-like nests, while Tuscany usually goes for long, wide strips of egg pasta. Pretty simple. No matter the region, these pastas start with basic stuff: just flour and water, sometimes eggs. Always shaped by hand with a little fantasia and a lot of patience.
That tender dough and golden color—when you work it yourself—really makes a difference. This is the kind of pasta that soaks up flavors and feels homemade in the best way. And that's why so many folks say the best homemade mac and cheese starts with pasta you roll out yourself, just like they do in these Italian kitchens. No question.
The love for this homemade macaroni shines in all sorts of dishes, but it’s hard to beat when you turn it into a cozy homemade mac and cheese . Or even a creamy stovetop version. Seriously, with those moist noodles and just the right amount of sauce, you get that rich, cheesy bite that’s way way better than the boxed stuff.
Regional shapes like those from Tuscany or Lazio really hold onto the gooey cheese. Makes every forkful a little extra special. And listen, while there are loads of ways to dress it up—some families in Emilia Romagna might go for a meat ragù or a splash of tangy tomato—there’s a kind of joy in keeping things simple. Fresh, crispy breadcrumbs on top, a handful of grated Parmigiano, maybe a touch of nutmeg, and you’re set.
Whether you’re after an easy mac and cheese recipe or want to try baked or stovetop styles, starting with fresh, regional pasta makes a huge difference. For real. It’s a great way to bring people together, proving you don’t need fancy stuff—just good dough, a little time, and some Italian creativity to make really memorable food.

To prepare homemade macaroni, start by combining semolina flour, water , and salt in a bowl. Begin kneading by hand until the dough is compact ,
then transfer it to your work surface and continue kneading by hand . Shape it into a dough ball , cover it with plastic wrap , and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
After the necessary time has passed, take the dough ball. Take a piece of dough and roll it into rods about the thickness of your pinky finger (approximately 1/5 in) , rolling with your hands on the work surface .
Cut small pieces with a dough cutter, approximately 1.5 inches . Wrap a piece around the specific iron (or if you don't have it, you can use a skewer) . Once wrapped, gently roll it with both hands to extend it .
Slide it off and you'll have the macaroni . Place the pasta on a tray lined with a lightly floured cloth . Your macaroni is ready to be cooked in salted boiling water.
We recommend consuming fresh pasta immediately. If you want to dry it, you can store it in a bag at room temperature in a dry place. Alternatively, you can freeze it this way: place the tray in the freezer and wait for the macaroni to harden a little, then store them in a freezer bag for convenience. It is not recommended to store raw pasta in the fridge as it may absorb moisture.
If you don't have the typical iron, you can use wooden skewers. Dress your macaroni with a fresh tomato sauce or a good meat ragù!
