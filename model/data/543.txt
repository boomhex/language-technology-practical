instructions:
To prepare the pumpkin pasta with scallion oil, take the pumpkin, divide it into four parts , keep the skin, but remove the seeds and internal filaments . Wrap the wedges in oven-safe aluminum foil .
Cover a baking tray with more foil, place the pumpkin on it, and bake in a preheated oven at 350°F for 90 minutes , this way the pumpkin will remain moist. Meanwhile, prepare the scallion oil: separate the green tops and slice the white part .
Cut the tops into pieces and place them in a blender, adding the seed oil . Blend for at least 2/3 minutes intermittently.
Strain the obtained puree through a fine mesh strainer , thus getting a flavored oil . Once the pumpkin is ready, take it out of the oven .
Scoop it into the blender , pour in the oil in a thin stream , and add a pinch of salt .
Blend until the cream is smooth and set aside . Peel and dice the potatoes . In a tall pot, pour a splash of olive oil and the white part of the scallion .
Add the potatoes and season with bay leaf . Salt and pepper, then sauté over moderate heat .
Add the pumpkin cream , mix well, and pour in 2 ladles of vegetable broth or hot water, cover with the lid, and cook for 10 minutes . At this point, add the pasta to the pot .
Cook by adding enough vegetable broth or hot water to cook the pasta , remove the bay leaf, and stir occasionally. Blend with butter and grated Grana Padano DOP .
Plate and season with the scallion oil . Garnish with pumpkin seeds . The pumpkin pasta with scallion oil is ready to be served .
We recommend consuming the pumpkin pasta with scallion oil immediately.
To obtain a scallion oil with a more intense taste and color, we recommend preparing it the night before and storing it in the fridge. Cooking the pumpkin with aluminum foil allows for a moist and soft pumpkin, perfect for adding creaminess.
