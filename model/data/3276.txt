Pollo in fricassea is a classic comfort dish straight from Central Italy , and it’s just what you need when you're craving something heartwarming. This recipe sticks to tradition while making it easier for everyday cooks. You start with chicken pieces browned with onion and a touch of butter—so, so good—giving it a golden color and tender feel. After that, it simmers in vegetable broth. And the sauce? It’s the real game-changer. Eggs and lemon stirred in at the end make it creamy and slightly tangy, totally different from other traditional Italian chicken stew recipes. Some folks in Tuscany add animelle (sweetbreads) for that extra richness, but this version skips that, keeping it simple. Pretty much. Yet, it still delivers that moist goodness everyone loves about Italian stews.
What’s cool about chicken fricassee in Italy is how every region has its own twist. In places like Tuscany or Lazio, you might find it with more herbs or a splash of white wine—seriously good—turning it into a braised chicken with white wine sauce . This easy Italian chicken fricassee is a real crowd-pleaser because it uses basic ingredients like bay leaves, rosemary, and broth. But, the egg-and-lemon finish makes it really, really stand out from your usual chicken dinner.
The result? A silky sauce that clings to every bite. Perfect for scooping up with crusty bread or maybe a side of simple rice. You get these soft, almost velvety bites of chicken that feel pretty special—even though it’s super simple to make. For anyone craving a cozy meal that tastes like something you'd enjoy in a little trattoria in Central Italy, this creamy chicken fricassee is just the thing. It's perfect for a busy weeknight or a laid-back Sunday dinner with friends. Plus, it offers good flavors, a sauce that’s a bit zesty, and fits right into any day of the week. Whether you're a seasoned cook or just starting out, this dish is an awesome way to bring a taste of Italy into your home. For real.
To prepare the chicken fricassee, finely slice the onion and let it soften in a pan with the butter for at least 10 minutes over low heat . Now take your chicken, clean it well and cut it into pieces: cut the chicken in half ,
first cut the wings, then the thighs , separate the back from the breast and cut both into pieces (for a detailed guide on how to correctly cut the chicken click here). Now add the chicken pieces to the onion
and brown them on all sides for a few minutes (use tongs to turn the chicken). Deglaze everything with some white wine and prepare a bundle of herbs (tying together bay leaf and rosemary with kitchen string) to add to the meat .
Add a ladle of vegetable broth to everything , cover with a lid and continue cooking over low heat for at least 30 minutes (if the chicken dries too much, add more broth). Towards the end of cooking, adjust salt and pepper. The chicken fricassee is ready : serve it in a rather deep serving dish, which can also contain the sauce formed during cooking.
Store the chicken fricassee in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 48 hours.
If you desire a creamier sauce, you can add a tablespoon of white flour at the end of cooking, first dissolving it in a little warm water to eliminate any lumps.
