instructions:
To prepare the meatloaf with vegetables and cheese, let's start with the filling. After trimming and peeling the carrots, cut them into sticks about 1/4 inch thick . Then cut the tougher parts of the asparagus and split them in half .
Finally, trim the zucchini and cut them into sticks as well; they should all be roughly the same size . Now move on to cooking. In a pan, pour a dash of oil and let it cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes . In another pan, cook the trimmed asparagus, zucchini, and green beans together, also with a splash of oil, for 5 minutes .
At the end of cooking, they will be crunchy; set aside the carrots, asparagus, green beans, and zucchini to cool . Cut the cheese into slices and start mixing the meatloaf. In a bowl, add the ground meat, grated Grana Padano DOP cheese, and the egg ,
breadcrumbs , salt, pepper, and start kneading . Work for a few minutes until you get a uniform mixture .
Then spread the mixture with your hands on a sheet of parchment paper, forming a rectangle about 16x12 inches thick . In the middle, distribute the vegetables and cheese . Use the parchment paper to roll everything well
until you get the classic meatloaf shape. Let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes . After the time has passed, remove the parchment paper and place the stuffed meatloaf on a baking sheet with parchment paper, grease the surface and proceed to cooking: the stuffed meatloaf bakes in a static oven, preheated in static mode at 356°F, for about 50 minutes. Enjoy your meatloaf with vegetables and cheese while it's still hot
The meatloaf with vegetables and cheese can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.
If you prefer, you can also freeze it if you've used fresh ingredients.
If Emmental is not your favorite cheese, you can use a gooey cheese of your choice. How about Asiago, Provolone, or Scamorza? The meatloaf with vegetables and cheese can be enhanced with some aromatic herbs to your liking and maybe some finely chopped nuts like almonds or walnuts.
