instructions:
To prepare the roast in a pressure cooker, first take the tied piece of meat , otherwise read our tutorial: How to tie a roast to do it yourself. Pour a drizzle of oil into a pressure cooker with a capacity of 4.5 L and heat it over medium-high heat. Then place the roast inside .
Brown it well on all sides, turning it with tongs from time to time , being careful not to pierce it. Then transfer it to a cutting board and pour the white wine into the pot .
Deglaze the cooking juices and pour the liquid into a small bowl . Coarsely chop the celery and onion .
Do the same with the carrot . Pour another drizzle of oil into the same pot and add the vegetables . Let them stew over medium-low heat .
Pour back the reserved cooking juices , place the roast back inside and add the aromatic herbs .
Add a pinch of salt and a grating of pepper . Close the pressure cooker and cook over medium-high heat. As soon as it comes to pressure (you will hear a continuous whistle), lower the heat to medium and count 20 minutes. After this time, turn off the heat and let the pot vent completely. Once it is no longer under pressure, you can open the lid. The pressure cooker roast is ready !
You can store the roast in the fridge for 2 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
Once cooked, you can let the roast rest in a well-covered baking dish. This way, when you slice it, the slices will remain intact.
If you prefer, you can blend the cooking juices to make a sauce to serve over the meat slices.
As cuts, you can use bottom round, shoulder, or beef rump. You can also opt for pork or veal, changing the cooking times.
How do you use a pressure cooker?
It's important not to overfill the pressure cooker. Usually, a mark inside the pot indicates the level not to exceed: generally 2/3. For foods that increase in volume, like rice, it's recommended not to exceed half. Before starting cooking, make sure the lid is properly closed and the valve is shut. As soon as the pot reaches pressure, you can lower the heat to keep the steam release from the valve as constant and "gentle" as possible. By keeping it to a minimum, you will also save energy.
How do you open a pressure cooker?
Never open the lid while steam is escaping from the valve. After cooking, you must release all the steam by lifting or rotating the valve, and once the pot is no longer under pressure, you can open the lid. Be careful with the steam jet during the "decompression" moment.
