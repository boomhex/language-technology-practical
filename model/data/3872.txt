Wash the bones thoroughly under running water, then place them in a large pot with the veal trimmings, fill with cold water until everything is covered, cover with a lid, and bring to a boil. Let it boil for 5 minutes, then drain the liquid and wash the bones first with hot water and then with cold water: at this point, place everything back in the pot with cold water and bring to a boil again. Boil for an hour, skimming and removing fat from the surface often. In the meantime, clean all the vegetables and cut them into pieces, then after an hour of cooking, immerse all the ingredients in the stock and continue cooking for another hour. Once cooking is complete, turn off the heat, let it rest for 15-20 minutes, and then strain everything through a sieve.
For this preparation, you can purchase pieces of foot, bones derived from the veal rack, and pieces of tail from the butcher. The bones, instead of being blanched, can be degreased in the oven by placing them in a baking tray for 5 minutes at 392°F; you will then need to remove them from the oven, remove the excess fat, and continue preparing the white stock according to the recipe.
