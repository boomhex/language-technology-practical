To prepare the cod terrine with apple sauce, start by rinsing the raisins under running water, then place them in a small bowl with the white wine : leave for at least 30 minutes. Then take the desalted cod (if you have salted cod, you can follow our cooking school: How to Desalt Cod ) and quickly rinse it under a stream of cold water, then pat it dry . Remove the fish skin with the sharp blade of a knife ,
remove the bones using kitchen tweezers and place it in the mixer to blend. Transfer the minced cod to a large bowl to which you will add the beaten egg yolks .
Also add the grated cheese and pine nuts . Then drain the raisins and set the wine aside .
Add the raisins to the other ingredients . Finely chop the well-rinsed and dried parsley and add it to the bowl as well .
Mix the ingredients well with a fork to obtain a homogeneous mixture . Now butter an 11x4 inch loaf pan with a height of 2.75 inches and line it with parchment paper : you can cut strips of parchment paper to the width and length of the pan's bottom and sides, so there are no uncovered spaces. Transfer the mixture obtained , leveling it with a spatula.
Sprinkle with the grated cheese and bake in a static oven preheated to 340°F for 50-55 minutes (if using a fan oven, 300°F for 40-45 minutes will suffice). While the cod terrine is in the oven, focus on the apple sauce: cut them in half and peel them. Cut them into wedges and then into cubes .
Place them in a non-stick pan and add the white wine you used to soak the raisins : let it evaporate over medium heat. When the wine has evaporated, peel the ginger with a vegetable peeler and grate the peel directly into the pan . Cook over moderate heat for a few minutes, then add the sugar .
Add the water and let it cook for about a few minutes until the water is almost completely absorbed . Continue to stir to blend the ingredients and flavors. The apples at the end of cooking should be well cooked and very soft. Then transfer them to a narrow, high-sided container .
Blend them with an immersion mixer and your apple sauce will be ready. Meanwhile, the cod terrine will also be ready (you can test the cooking with a toothpick) : unmold it by turning it upside down on a serving plate , being careful to gently remove the parchment paper as well.
You can choose to serve the cod terrine by cutting a few slices and placing the apple sauce on them and on the terrine itself . Your cod with apple sauce is now ready to be served and enjoyed !
Although we recommend consuming the cod terrine with apple sauce when freshly made, it is possible to store this preparation in the fridge covered with plastic wrap for up to 1 day.
You can also, if desired, freeze the cod terrine once cooked only if you have used fresh and not defrosted ingredients. However, we do not recommend freezing the apple sauce.
How to flavor this bold-tasting mixture? You can replace or add the fragrant thyme to the parsley!
The term cod refers to Atlantic cod. This fish can be preserved by salting (and is called "baccalà") or drying (in this case it is called "stockfish"). Although this distinction is necessary, in some regions of Italy there is confusion about the use of the two terms baccalà and stockfish, which are often used interchangeably.
Thanks to its versatility in the kitchen and its ease of pairing with many ingredients, cod lends itself to many preparations. Although a typical ingredient of poor cuisine, many regional recipes in Italy use it, and it has recently gained great fame, even being elevated to use in starred chefs' menus.
