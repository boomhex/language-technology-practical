Schiacciate con scaglie di Castelmagno e cipolle caramellate is this flatbread recipe that you often see at cozy gatherings in Piedmont. And you know what? It's really, really good. This dish mixes Castelmagno cheese —a local gem from Cuneo—with sweet and tangy caramelized onions . The cheese has a strong, slightly crisp flavor, and those onions? They add a soft, golden touch to each bite. Can't go wrong. It all sits on thin, rustic flatbread, a staple up in northern Italy. Seems fancy but really just highlights local ingredients.
Thing is, in Piedmont, it's all about using what's around you. So, you'll find dishes like this in homes and cafés tucked in the mountain towns. The warm, rich aroma of this flatbread makes it super inviting for any occasion. There's something comforting—seriously good—about breaking off a piece of this cheese and onion flatbread.
This Italian appetizer shines as a snack or as part of a larger spread. Pretty much, it's perfect when friends stop by. Some towns might swap the Castelmagno for other cheeses, but honestly, nothing quite matches its rich and tender style.
The onions are cooked until they're moist and slightly jammy—perfectly balancing the salty cheese. If you're after an easy flatbread with a special touch, this one's a winner. Fits right in with traditional Italian recipes —offering elegance, local flavor, and a taste that really invites you back for more. Whether you're having it as a gourmet snack or a starter, the combo of Castelmagno and caramelized onions turns something simple into something unforgettable. The layers of flavor and the soft texture make each bite a really good experience, perfect for sharing with loved ones or savoring solo.
Start by preparing the caramelized onions: clean the onions and slice them not too thinly (using a knife or a mandoline). Heat the oil in a non-stick pan and allow the sliced onions to soften . When the onions become translucent, add the brown sugar and mix well.
Wait for the onions to caramelize, then deglaze with white wine vinegar , season with salt and pepper, and complete the cooking of the onions. Cut the Castelmagno cheese into thin flakes and place a tablespoon of caramelized onions on each "La Bottega di Olivia&Marino" Flatbread , and garnish with the cheese. Decorate each appetizer with a sprig of fresh thyme.
