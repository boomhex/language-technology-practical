To prepare the olive puffs with ricotta and grilled peppers, wash the peppers thoroughly and grill them in a convection oven at 482°F for 20 minutes . When they are ready, peel them, remove the seeds , and cut them into strips, then into cubes, keeping some strips aside for the final decoration .
Put the ricotta in a small bowl and add the diced peppers , then finely chop the savory and add it to the mixture , always keeping some leaves aside for the final decoration. Mix well with a fork to blend all the ingredients and adjust the salt .
At this point, transfer the mixture into a piping bag with a star nozzle and start composing the puffs by squeezing a dollop of ricotta and grilled pepper cream onto each puff , then place a rolled-up strip of pepper in the center and finally some leaves of savory on each pepper .
We recommend assembling the olive puffs with ricotta and grilled peppers at the moment and consuming them shortly, to fully enjoy their crunchiness. If you wish, you can still store the ricotta and grilled pepper cream in the refrigerator, closed in an airtight container, for up to two days.
If you prefer, you can replace savory with thyme or fresh oregano.
