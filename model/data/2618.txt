instructions:
To prepare the Mornay sauce, grate the aged Asiago cheese, then in a saucepan, heat the milk , while in another melt the butter over low heat , add a pinch of salt when it is completely melted .
Then remove it from the heat to add the flour little by little , stirring with a whisk to avoid lumps. Put the saucepan back on the heat and toast the flour for a few moments, stirring constantly, and when it becomes golden, add the milk at room temperature or slightly warmed . Stir continuously and season with a grating of nutmeg. Then once it reaches boiling, turn off the heat and add the grated Asiago cheese .
In a separate small bowl, beat the egg yolks with the fresh liquid cream , then add them to the béchamel and mix with the whisk to combine the mixtures (if necessary, you can return the sauce to the heat to thicken it more).
Once ready, pour the sauce into a low, wide baking dish (10-11) and cover with contact wrap to cool at room temperature, then place it in the refrigerator. Once ready, you can serve it to accompany your dishes, or place it in a piping bag with a narrow nozzle to fill your preparations, such as Savory Fried Bombs !
Mornay sauce can be stored in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for 1-2 days.
Freezing is not recommended.
If you prefer, you can replace the Asiago cheese with Pecorino, Grana, or Parmesan and add a pinch of pepper!
