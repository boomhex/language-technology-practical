instructions:
To prepare the gluten-free focaccia, first boil the potatoes for about 20 minutes (1-2). Then mash them in a bowl and let them cool slightly.
Pour the room temperature water into a small jug, add the fresh yeast and stir with a teaspoon until it dissolves . When the potatoes are lukewarm, add the rice flour
and the tapioca flour . Add the water in which you dissolved the yeast and start kneading with your hands .
Once you have a uniform mixture, add the salt and the oil . Knead again until everything is well absorbed . Don't worry if the dough is a bit sticky.
Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for about 2 hours, preferably at a temperature of around 80°F. After two hours , grease a 9.5-inch pan and pour the dough inside. Gently press with your hands to spread it evenly across the pan .
Pour the oil on top , press with your fingertips to create the classic dimples , place the rosemary sprigs on top
and the coarse salt . Bake in a preheated static oven at 392°F for 40 minutes. Remove your gluten-free focaccia from the oven and let it cool slightly before removing from the mold and serving .
It is recommended to consume the gluten-free focaccia on the same day. It can be warmed up before serving.
Freezing is not recommended.
You can omit the mashed potatoes and replace them with 2.1 oz of potato starch and add about 1/4 cup of water. It will be lower. The cooking time is reduced by about 10 minutes.
