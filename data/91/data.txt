To prepare the potato and onion ravioli with cheese cream, first boil the potatoes starting from cold water until they are soft; it will take about 30-40 minutes, depending on the size. Meanwhile, focus on the fresh pasta: place the flour in a fountain shape on the work surface and pour the yolks in the center 2 , then add a pinch of salt 3 and a little water.
Start incorporating the flour by beating the eggs with a fork 4 , then help yourself with a scraper and finally knead with your hands until you obtain a compact, smooth, and homogeneous dough 5 . Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 20 minutes 6 .
In the meantime, take care of the filling: peel the onions and cut them into julienne strips 7 , then pour them into a saucepan where you have heated a drizzle of oil 8 . Sauté over high heat, stirring often 9 .
When they have taken on color, deglaze with water 10 and continue stirring to scrape the bottom well. Continue cooking until they are nice and soft and caramelized 11 ; it will take about 10-15 minutes. Transfer the caramelized onions to a cutting board and finely chop them with a knife 12 .
Meanwhile, the potatoes will be ready, so pass them through a potato ricer and collect them in a large bowl 13 . Salt 14 , pepper, and add the chopped onions 15 .
Flavor with thyme leaves 16 and mix the mixture 17 , then transfer it to a piping bag without a nozzle 18 .
Now take back the dough, divide it into smaller portions, and roll it out with a pasta machine starting from the widest thickness down to the penultimate (about 1/16 inch) 19 . Give some folds to the sheets when moving from one roller to another to give more strength to the dough. Lay the sheets on the work surface and cut out discs with a cookie cutter with a diameter of 2.75 inches 20 . You can knead and roll out the scraps again to make more ravioli. Squeeze a dollop of filling in the center of each disc 21 , then spray them with a little water to facilitate sealing.
Fold each disc in half to form a half-moon 22 , then press the edges well to seal, taking care to expel all the air. Finally, close the ravioli by gently pushing with your thumb inward 23 and pinching the ends together 24 . Continue this way to form all the ravioli; with these quantities, you will get about fifty.
At this point, prepare the fondue: grate the castelmagno 25 . In a saucepan, pour the cream and grated cheese 26 , then heat over very low heat for about ten minutes until melted, stirring occasionally with a small whisk 27 .
You are ready to cook: bring a pot of salted water to a boil, drop in a few ravioli at a time 28 and cook for 2-3 minutes. Drain the ravioli in a pan, then add a ladle of their cooking water 29 and the butter 30 .
Toss gently off the heat 31 , then plate. Complete the dish with the castelmagno fondue 32 and a few thyme leaves. Your potato and onion ravioli with cheese cream are ready to be served 33 !
It is recommended to consume the potato and onion ravioli with cheese cream immediately. If there are leftovers, they can be stored in the refrigerator for 1 day.
You can freeze the raw ravioli and cook them directly from frozen, slightly increasing the cooking time.
The potato and onion ravioli are made with a dough based solely on yolks, ideal for fresh stuffed pasta. As it is rather hard to work with, you can add a little more water if needed or, if you prefer, use a mixer.
It is important not to dust the work surface with flour when forming the ravioli; otherwise, they will not seal.
