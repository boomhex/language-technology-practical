Scrippelle 'mbusse is this really charming dish from Teramo, right in the heart of Abruzzo . It's such a beautiful city, and you know what?

They’re rolled up and soaked in a steaming, flavorful chicken broth. And the taste? Imagine these paper-thin Italian crepes in broth, almost like pasta sheets, but so much lighter.

What sets scrippelle ‘mbusse apart from other Italian soups? The focus is on that broth and those thin crepes soaking up every last drop. In Teramo cuisine, this dish often pops up during holidays and Sunday lunches—sometimes after a heavier meal—because it feels lighter but still warms you up. And listen, the broth is usually homemade, filling the air with a rich and inviting aroma. Thing is, the secret lies in rolling the crepes just tight enough to hold, but not too tight, so the broth seeps in perfectly. Compared to some other traditional Italian soup recipes, this one’s way, way more rustic and genuine. The soft texture is a big reason why everyone loves it. Whether you call it a scrippelle recipe or just crepes in chicken broth, it brings a touch of Abruzzo right into your kitchen. These simple flavors stick with you, and each bite gives you that warm blend of broth and crepe that's simply classic. It's pretty much the kind of meal that offers not just nourishment but a taste of Italian heritage that sticks with you long after the last spoonful. Really.

To optimize time, you can prepare the broth even the day before.
How to use the meat from the broth? It's simple! You can shred it and dress it with green sauce, grilled vegetables, or a salad. Alternatively, you can use it to make delicious Meatballs , such as the typical Milanese Mondeghili (Milanese meatballs) !
