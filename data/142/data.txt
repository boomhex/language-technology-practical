For a gourmet touch, you can add some salmon roe and a grating of fresh horseradish as a garnish. If you want a crunchy texture, you can brush the bread discs with a little oil and bake them in a preheated static oven at 320°F for 10 minutes, just until they are golden. Wait for the bread discs to cool and become crispy before filling them.
