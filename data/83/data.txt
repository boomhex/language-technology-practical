Ricotta fritters, oh man, are the stars of Carnevale buffets all over Italy, especially Central and Southern parts, whenever the festive season rolls around. What makes these ricotta fritters so fun? It’s how they mix moist ricotta cheese with zesty orange flavor and little bursts of chocolate chips. Really, the orange zest isn’t just for show—it gives the fritters this fresh smell and a bit of tangy taste that just wakes up your senses. They’re not just plain sweet treats; they’ve got a tender middle thanks to the ricotta—making every bite sort of melt in your mouth. Pretty much. Unlike the heavier castagnole or the fruity tortelli alle mele, these orange ricotta fritters pull you in with their citrus kick and those chocolate bits scattered throughout. Folks often chat about them as the ultimate surprise on the dessert table during Carnival time, with that playful mix of orange ricotta fritters and chocolate chip fritters in one. Seriously good.
At any big Italian Carnival party, you’ll see people grab these fritters before anything else because they really are the definition of indulgent snacking. You get this golden outer layer that’s just the right amount of crispy, then bite in to find a moist, slightly sweet middle, all dotted with gooey chocolate chips. You know? In some towns, people add extra orange zest or swap out the chocolate chips for chopped candied citrus, but the classic combo always wins. These chocolate chip fritters are among those Italian dessert recipes that feel fancy but are actually pretty simple, fitting in with all kinds of easy fritter recipes. For sure. They’re great for sharing, too—people just grab them with their hands and pop them in their mouths, leaving a little trail of powdered sugar everywhere. So... When you’re in the mood for sweet ricotta pastries that bring a real Carnival vibe, these citrus-infused fritters are a no-brainer. Whether you call them homemade ricotta desserts or just Italian party food, they always seem to disappear fast once the plate hits the table, leaving everyone wanting more of that great Carnevale taste. Cannot go wrong.

Use a kitchen thermometer to keep the oil constant at 340°F. If the oil is too hot, you risk burning the outside of the fritters while leaving them raw inside; on the other hand, if the oil isn't hot enough, the fritters will absorb too much oil and end up greasy and not crispy.
