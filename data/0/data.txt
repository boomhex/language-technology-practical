This version’s thicker, with a more delicate flavor. Why? Because of those eggs blended right in. People love how it works as a base for an egg salad recipe or as a moist spread on sandwiches. It’s not your basic store-bought mayo—this homemade mayonnaise really really lets you taste the difference. When you want something richer and more tender, this is it.
And listen, whether you’re putting it next to cold meats, dipping veggies, or spooning it onto fish, it brings out those French vibes—pretty much. Folks use it at all kinds of gatherings like family buffets or quick lunches. Why? It’s so versatile and makes even basic dishes seem way way fancier without any stress.
In different regions of France, people might mix in a bit of mustard or fresh herbs to switch things up. Thing is, each version is just a bit different from the last. That's the cool part— mayonnaise with cooked eggs goes with so many things, and you can tweak it however you want. I mean, it’s kinda like how sauce gribiche shows up in French cooking, but this is smoother, really. Especially when you use a blender. You get a thick, rich base that’s awesome for a classic egg salad or an egg sandwich spread that actually sticks. And here's the deal, bringing homemade sauces to the table makes regular food feel a bit more special—it is awesome.
The flavor? Mild but still assertive, so it stands up to smoked salmon, roast beef, or just some boiled potatoes on the side. Once you try it, you might find yourself skipping the store-bought stuff for good. And the golden look and real taste make every bite that much better. Plus, you can whip it up in no time. Perfect for when you want something really good without the fuss. For sure.
