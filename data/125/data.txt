Risotto with stracchino is a big deal in Northern Italy, especially in Lombardy . And you know what? This isn’t your ordinary broccoli risotto . Nope. It’s got a unique blend of flavors and textures that'll make you really, really happy. The creamy base of stracchino cheese melts just right—making each bite super moist and smooth.
Broccoli shows up in two ways here. One part is blended into a tender green cream, infusing every spoonful. The other part? Sautéed till it’s slightly crispy, then tossed on top. Seriously good. This combo keeps things interesting, so you're never left with a dull bite.
Then there are the anchovy fillets. Small but mighty, they offer a burst of salty goodness that cuts through the richness and highlights the broccoli's earthiness. People in Lombardy love this mix—no question.
