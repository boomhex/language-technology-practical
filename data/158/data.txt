Apple puff pastry squares bring a taste of Northern Italy right into your kitchen. Really good stuff.

Seriously, this combo of warm, soft apples and that hint of citrus makes them stand out from your usual easy apple dessert .

To prepare the apple puff pastry squares, first clean the apples. Core them and cut them into fairly thin slices 1 . In a pot, melt the butter, then add the lime zest 2 and the apples 3 .
Add the sugar 4 , lime juice 5 , and stir 6 . Cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes. A syrup should form that will thicken and caramelize over time, while the apples will break down into a compote-like consistency. Once ready, let it cool completely.
On a baking sheet covered with parchment paper, lay out the puff pastry and prick it with a fork 7 . Spread the sliced almonds 8 on the surface to enrich the filling and partially protect the pastry from the moisture of the filling. Pour the apple compote 9 and spread it over the surface, leaving 3/4 inch from the edges.
Place a second puff pastry sheet on top 10 and seal the edges well 11 . Brush with melted butter 12 .
Sprinkle the surface first with sliced almonds 13 and then with sugar 14 . Using a knife, apply pressure to score the top layer of the pastry and the filling, but not the bottom layer, creating lines on the surface: 4 on the short side and 6 on the long side 15 . This way, you'll form the squares.
Once this is done 16 , bake in a static oven at 350°F for 35-40 minutes 17 . For perfect browning, check during the final minutes that the sugar has caramelized; if not, place the baking sheet on the top rack and continue baking for a few more minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Separate the squares with your hands or a knife, and dust with powdered sugar. Your apple puff pastry squares are ready to be enjoyed 18 .
The apple puff pastry squares can be stored in the refrigerator, in a closed container, for 1-2 days.
Renette apples are ideal, but other types work too. This dessert is perfect for using up apples that are about to become mealy. If you don't have lime, you can use lemon. You can customize the squares by adding to the filling: raisins, chopped walnuts, cinnamon, or chocolate chips. They are delicious when served warm with a quenelle of unsweetened cream.
