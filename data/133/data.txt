Squid risotto is a beloved dish in Northern Italy , especially along the coast where seafood's a big deal. With squid risotto , you get something that feels creamy and a bit fancy—yet it’s really about fresh flavors and simple comfort. Honestly, Carnaroli rice is the real star here. It's what gives this seafood risotto that velvety texture everyone loves. Really, the rice soaks up the tomato concentrate and white wine—making every bite rich and moist. And look, in Italy, folks often finish things off with a bit of butter and Parmigiano, a step called mantecatura, which makes everything taste so so tender and smooth. Fresh parsley is tossed in right at the end for a splash of color and a pop of freshness—perfect with the gentle taste of the calamari.
For anyone who loves classic Italian risotto recipes , this version stays true to tradition but keeps it easy. Which is great. Instead of mixing in a ton of other seafood, this dish really lets the calamari shine. Sometimes cooks add a handful of clams or a bit of shrimp for a bigger seafood kick—especially near the Ligurian or Venetian coasts. Compared to dishes like squid ink risotto , this one's lighter but still packed with flavor, perfect for a weekend dinner. You get those subtle ocean notes, a hint of tangy tomato, and that amazing golden color from the rice and butter. I mean, it all comes together in a way that feels easy but still kinda elegant.
Anyone who’s into easy seafood recipes or wants a taste of traditional Italian dishes will likely make this calamari risotto again and again. And once they see how stress-free and crispy the final result can be with just a bit of patience, they are hooked. For real. With its coastal charm and simple prep, this risotto offers a little slice of Italian seaside life right at your table. Pretty simple.
