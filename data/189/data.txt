To prepare the berry millefeuille, start with the custard cream, one of the elements of the diplomat cream: place the gelatin in a bowl with cold water 1 and let it soak for about ten minutes. Meanwhile, heat the milk in a saucepan, flavoring it with the seeds of the vanilla pod 2 and the grated lemon zest 3 ; it should come close to a boil.
In a separate bowl, pour the egg yolks and sugar 4 , whisk them, then add the cornstarch 5 and mix again 6 .
Add the hot milk to the egg yolk mixture in 2 parts 7 , then transfer everything back to the saucepan 8 and let it simmer gently, stirring constantly with the whisk 9 .
When the cream has thickened, turn off the heat and incorporate the well-drained gelatin 10 . Mix well to combine it evenly 11 , then transfer the cream to a baking dish, cover with cling film in contact with the surface, and let it cool completely 12 .
While the cream is cooling, take care of the puff pastry: roll it out on the work surface and divide it into 2 rectangles 13 , then prick them with a fork 14 . Transfer the pastry sheets onto a baking sheet with their parchment paper and sprinkle the entire surface with powdered sugar 15 .
Bake in a preheated fan oven at 340°F for about 10-15 minutes 16 . After this time, remove from the oven 17 and cover with another sheet of parchment paper 18 .
Place another baking tray on top to apply pressure 19 and bake for another 10 minutes; this way, the puff pastry will not puff up. Once golden, remove from the oven and melt any remaining sugar with a blowtorch 20 , then let it cool 21 .
Now pour the cream into a bowl and work with electric whisks 22 until it is whipped, but not too much 23 . Take the custard cream and soften it by mixing with a spatula 24 .
Incorporate the semi-whipped cream into the custard a little at a time 25 , gently mixing from bottom to top so as not to deflate it 26 . Transfer the resulting diplomat cream 27 into a piping bag without a nozzle.
You are ready to assemble the millefeuille: place the first pastry sheet on the serving plate and cover it with tufts of diplomat cream 28 , then add half of the berries 29 . Fill with a little more cream 30 .
Place the second pastry sheet on top 31 and cover it with tufts of cream 32 , then distribute the other half of the berries 33 .
Finally, dust with powdered sugar 34 and garnish with mint leaves 35 . Your berry millefeuille is ready to be served 36 !
The berry millefeuille can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days in an airtight container.
Both the custard cream and diplomat cream can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to 4-5 days. Alternatively, they can be frozen for a month.
You can use the berries you prefer.
The diplomat cream can be replaced with simple custard cream or chantilly cream, if you prefer!
When combining the egg yolks with sugar to prepare the custard cream, remember to mix immediately, otherwise, the eggs will cook and lumps will form.
