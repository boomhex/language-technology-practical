Mushrooms in oil, or “funghi sott’olio” as they say in Italy, are a must-have at any good antipasto table. These marinated mushrooms really show off the tender side of Italian home cooking. And you know what? They let you savor the earthy, woodsy flavor of mushrooms like champignon, porcini, or even cardoncelli all year long. This mushrooms in oil recipe locks in that rich taste with a good soak in olive oil, garlic, herbs, and maybe just a touch of vinegar. In different parts of Italy, people might add peppercorns or even a dash of chili, so you can definitely play around with your own twist. The result? A jar full of moist, savory mushrooms ready to elevate any snack or meal. Spoon them on warm toasted bread or pop them onto a pizza for that rustic touch.
Honestly, no matter the occasion, these pickled mushrooms come through every single time. Think big family dinners or quick lunches, and they are just perfect for those fancy cheese boards when guests pop by. They work great as a marinated mushroom appetizer , side dish, or nestled next to some cured meats. What really sets them apart from other preserved veggies is how the oil becomes super aromatic and flavorful. Even a little drizzle from the jar can make a salad or roasted potatoes taste so so special. It's common in Italian kitchens to keep a few jars around—alongside sun-dried tomatoes, eggplants, or artichokes done "sott’olio" style. That way, you've always got something with a crispy bite and a tangy kick ready to go. These preserved mushrooms turn everyday dishes into something really, really special, and they last quite a while too. So you get both convenience and authentic Italian flavor without much fuss. Mix and match with whatever mushrooms you find fresh at the market, and don’t hesitate to share a jar or two—people always get excited about homemade stuff like this! Perfect for all kinds of dishes, from pasta to gourmet pizzas , these mushrooms add a burst of flavor to any meal, for sure.

To prepare mushrooms in oil, start by cleaning the champignon mushrooms: remove the base of the stem 1 and gently clean the surface with a cloth or damp napkin 2 (if the mushrooms are very dirty, you can opt for a quick rinse in cold water for a few seconds). Cut them in half 3 .
Set the mushrooms aside 4 . Clean and finely chop the garlic 5 , and slice the fresh chili pepper into rings 6 .
In a saucepan, heat the vinegar 7 and water 8 ; as soon as it nears boiling, immerse the mushrooms 9 and add salt.
When the solution starts boiling again 10 , add the rosemary, chili pepper 11 , and chopped garlic 12 .
Also add the bay leaves 13 and stir. Wait 1 minute, then let it cool slightly and drain the mushrooms with a skimmer 14 , transferring them to a colander 15 .
Dry everything on a clean cloth 16 , patting them well. Then take a perfectly clean 17 oz glass jar with a new lid. Fill it with the mushrooms, pressing them lightly 17 . Then fill with extra virgin olive oil to the top in two steps, waiting for the oil to distribute throughout the jar 18 .
Seal with the lid 19 and submerge in a pot with cold water. Turn on the heat and bring to a boil for about 60 minutes. After this time, let the jars cool in the water itself. To be sure the 'vacuum sealing' operation is successful, just check that the lid doesn’t click when pressed with fingers.
Store your mushrooms in oil in a cool place away from light.
Since it's a homemade preparation, we recommend consuming the mushrooms within 6 months. If you notice signs of alteration, such as air bubbles rising from the bottom to the lid or the oil becoming cloudy, the preserve might not be safe to consume. In case of doubt, it is essential not to taste or consume the product.
For a milder alternative to garlic and chili, you can use thyme or marjoram for an intense yet balanced aroma. If using other types of mushrooms, the blanching time in water and vinegar is almost always the same; it always depends on the size and type of mushrooms.
Homemade preparation of preserves and jams can pose health risks. In a domestic environment, it is not possible to create the necessary conditions and measures to ensure food safety and suitability, which industrial procedures can ensure to prevent dangerous contamination. It is therefore important to strictly follow food safety guidelines to reduce risks, but one must always keep in mind that one can never achieve the same food safety as professionally produced preserves and jams. For correct preparation of homemade preserves, we refer to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health .
