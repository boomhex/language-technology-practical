Carefully unmold the Bavarian cream on top of the biscuit 43 ; if necessary, you can slightly warm the mold with a torch. Finally, decorate with raspberry sauce as desired 44 . Let rest in the refrigerator for an hour before serving your beautiful Easter Bavarian Cream with Pistachio and Raspberries 45 !
The Easter Bavarian Cream with Pistachio and Raspberries can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, well covered with cling film or inside an airtight container.
