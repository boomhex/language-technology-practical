Jam crostata —it’s one of those treats that just feels like home. I mean, in Italy, this traditional Italian dessert is like a staple, whether it is breakfast, an afternoon snack, or even a sweet bite after dinner. Really comforting. What makes a jam crostata so inviting is that golden shortcrust shell, called pasta frolla. It bakes up with a crispy edge but stays tender inside. Always filled with a thick layer of fruit jam—apricot, cherry, raspberry, you name it. And the lattice pattern on top? It’s not just for looks. It helps the jam bubble up and get extra fragrant as it bakes.
Each region in Italy might use a different jam or put its own spin on the crostata recipe . But the heart of it? Always that cozy feeling you get from a homemade dessert shared with friends or family. So so comforting.
The Italian jam tart ? It’s tied to all those nostalgic memories of grandma’s kitchen or lazy Sunday mornings. People often chat about how the right butter temperature makes the dough soft and easy to work with. And really, how the right thickness is key for that balance between a moist jam layer and a crisp base. No fancy stuff needed here—just good jam, a gentle hand with the dough, and a bit of time in the oven until everything is golden and bubbling. Some families like to get creative, maybe doing a two-flavor fruit crostata or swapping in different jams depending on the season. And the smell? For real, that alone is reason enough to make one.
The first slice always brings a rush of comfort. Whether you go for a simple apricot jam tart or a bold raspberry crostata, there’s something about this homemade crostata that reminds everyone of childhood and the little joys of Italian life. It's more than just a dessert; it's a piece of Italian tradition that brings people together—creating moments of happiness with each bite. Really really special.

To prepare the jam tart, you can mix by hand, or use a stand mixer to make the shortcrust pastry. Place the softened butter cut into pieces in the bowl of the stand mixer 1 , add the powdered sugar 2 , and work at low speed with the paddle attachment until you obtain a creamy mixture. Alternatively, you can do this step with a wooden spoon or by hand. Add the eggs 3 and mix again.
When they are well absorbed, add the flour, preferably sifted 4 , and the sifted yeast 5 . For flavoring, also add the vanilla extract 6 .
Mix again to combine everything 7 . Transfer the mixture to a work surface and quickly compact it to form a dough ball, but do not warm it too much with your hands 8 . Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour 9 . This will make the pastry easier to work with.
After this time, remove the plastic wrap and transfer the dough to a floured surface 10 . Add a little more flour and roll it out with a rolling pin 11 to a thickness of about 0.4 inches. Place the base of the mold in the center of the pastry and measure about 2 inches more in diameter 12 .
We used a 10-inch non-stick mold, so we cut out a pastry disk with a diameter of 12 inches 13 . Roll the pastry onto the rolling pin and unroll it gently over the mold to line both the base and the sides 14 . Press lightly with your hands to adhere well, then remove the excess by pressing firmly on the edges with the rolling pin 15 .
Prick the base with a fork 16 and generously fill with the jam 17 , spreading it evenly 18 .
At this point, knead the pastry scraps and roll them out again to a thickness of 0.4 inches 19 , then use a fluted pastry wheel to cut 8 strips about 11 inches long (0.8 inches more than the mold's diameter) 20 . Lay 4 strips diagonally on the tart's surface 21 .
Do the same in the other direction with the remaining 4 strips 22 , then remove the excess pastry, gently pressing the strips down 23 . Bake in a static oven preheated to 340°F for about 50 minutes, placing the pan on the bottom rack. Once baked, take it out of the oven and let it cool to room temperature before removing it from the mold and serving your jam tart 24 !
The jam tart can be stored at room temperature for 2-3 days, under a glass dome, or well covered.
You can freeze the tart after it's baked and cooled.
The pastry can be frozen for 7 days or kept in the fridge for 2-3 days.
Vary the filling of your tart using your preferred jam or preserve! You can use apricot, cherry, strawberry, berry jam, or whichever is your favorite flavor!
If you don't have a stand mixer, you can work the dough by hand, adding the ingredients in the same order and being careful to knead quickly to avoid warming it.
You can dust the surface with powdered sugar after it has completely cooled, if desired.
