Gratinated prawns from Southern Italy? They're just a beautiful mix of simplicity and a touch of elegance. Imagine those charming seaside towns where fresh seafood is like, part of everyday life. And look, the magic of a good baked prawns recipe is totally in the textures: juicy prawns with a crispy, aromatic breadcrumb layer on top. Seriously good stuff. The local pane di grano duro breadcrumbs, mixed with parsley and lemon zest, give it a fresh and zesty kick that's hard to resist. Add some Japanese panko—makes the crust light and crunchy—enhancing that classic, tender seafood experience cherished in Southern Italy.
Plus, whether you are hosting a weekend gathering or planning a special dinner, it feels effortless yet impressive. Gratinated prawns are a perfect choice. And the breadcrumbs? They soak up the juices, keeping the prawns moist and highlighting the flavors of the sea. Families in Campania or Calabria? They might throw in a hint of garlic or chili for an extra kick, but the core stays the same. For real, it's all about quality seafood, good bread, and simple, honest flavors. Pretty simple.

It's not just a shrimp gratin ; it's tradition—feels fresh—with a golden top that impresses at the table. Pair it with a salad and some chilled white wine, and you've got a meal that's both casual and, well, kinda fancy. I mean, this dish really shows how a few ingredients can create something amazing when done right. Enjoy the comforting, homemade feel it brings, and savor the authentic taste of Southern Italy.
