Ravioli with saffron and ossobuco—this one’s a true gem from Lombardy . Really, it captures the tender flavors of ossobuco alla milanese in such a cool way. Instead of the usual veal stew with risotto, they’ve used saffron-infused pasta dough. Pretty awesome, right? And look, that classic yellow color with a subtle aroma is just so so Milanese.
What really makes these saffron ravioli stand out is the moist and rich ossobuco filling. It kinda melts inside the pasta. Seriously, it’s like a stew but with a fresh twist. Plus, they sprinkle gremolada—a mix of parsley, lemon zest, and garlic—over the top. Adds a zesty kick, you know? And a fresh aroma, too.
This dish is rooted in Northern Italy’s traditions, yet it feels super innovative. It’s like a tribute to heritage with a touch of creativity. All across Milan and Lombardy , cooks take so much pride in reimagining recipes like ossobuco, and these ossobuco ravioli ? They’re a prime example, for sure.
The slow-cooked veal shank in these gourmet ravioli fillings keeps all that savory flavor intact. Now it's hugged by soft, silky pasta instead of rice. And here's the thing— ravioli with saffron and ossobuco pairs beautifully with a drizzle of its braising juices. Enhances the deep taste of the meat, plus the saffron pasta adds a slightly earthy touch. Pretty much perfect.
Some folks in Lombardy even experiment with other meats, but veal ossobuco ravioli? That’s the real Milanese deal. This kind of homemade ravioli shows off how Italian pasta dishes transform the old into something fresh, blending comfort with a hint of excitement. Whether you're in a bustling Milan kitchen or a quiet Lombard village, this dish reflects the art of Italian cooking—where tradition meets innovation—and every bite tells a story of its origins. Perfect for a family dinner or special gathering, it's a dish that brings the essence of Northern Italy right to your table.

To make saffron and ossobuco ravioli, first prepare the Beef Broth following our recipe. Keep it warm and start the dough: place the flour in a mound and pour the eggs in the center 1 , the saffron dissolved in a little water 2 , and a pinch of salt 3 .
Incorporate the flour first with a fork 4 and then by kneading with your hands on the work surface 5 until you obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough ball 6 . Cover with plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
In the meantime, prepare the ravioli filling: clean and finely chop the onion 7 , celery 8 , and carrot 9 .
In a pan, melt the butter with a drizzle of oil. Meanwhile, flour the ossobuco and remove any excess flour. Place the meat in the pan and brown for 3 minutes on each side 10 . Remove the ossobuco from the pan and set aside. Degrease the same pan with a paper towel 11 , then add a drizzle of oil, the onion, and the carrot 12 .
Add the celery 13 and chopped garlic 14 , then sauté for a few minutes. At this point, put the ossobuco back in the pan 15 .
Deglaze with white wine 16 and let all the alcohol evaporate. Moisten with the beef broth 17 , salt, and pepper 18 .
Cover with a lid 19 and cook for 90 minutes over medium heat. Once the ossobuco is cooked, extract the marrow 20 and set it aside in a bowl. Separate the meat from the bone and chop it with a knife 21 .
Meanwhile, reduce the cooking juice 22 . Add the chopped meat to the marrow 23 and the reduced cooking juice 24 .
Add the grated Parmigiano cheese 25 and mix 26 until you get a homogeneous mixture. Once cooled, transfer the filling to a piping bag and set aside. Retrieve the dough ball and pass it through a pasta machine 27 until you get a sheet about 1/16 inch thick.
Dust the work surface with a little semolina; this way, it will be easier to detach the ravioli after forming them. Divide the sheet in half and brush one of the parts with water 28 . Squeeze small mounds of filling on 2 rows about 1½ inches apart from each other 29 . Then cover with the second sheet 30 .
Press with your hands near the filling to eliminate the air 31 , making it less likely to open during cooking. Cut out the ravioli with a 3½-inch round cutter 32 . The leftover dough can be re-kneaded to form more ravioli; with these quantities, you will get about 22. Now, proceed with the preparation of the gremolata: in a bowl, grate a small piece of garlic 33 .
Add fresh chopped parsley 34 , grated lemon zest 35 , and a drizzle of oil 36 . Stir to combine the ingredients.
You are ready to cook: bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the ravioli for about 3 minutes 37 . Meanwhile, in a pan, melt the butter with a ladle of pasta cooking water 38 . Add part of the gremolata 39 and mix.
Drain the ravioli and transfer them to the pan 40 , then let the cooking liquid reduce; the sauce should be nice and creamy. Plate, finishing with more sauce 41 and a sprinkle of grated Parmigiano cheese. Your saffron and ossobuco ravioli are ready to be served 42 !
It is recommended to consume the saffron and ossobuco ravioli as soon as they are ready.
The ravioli can be stored raw, in the refrigerator, arranged on a floured tray and covered with a clean cloth, for up to one day. Alternatively, you can freeze them and cook them directly from frozen, slightly extending the cooking time.
If you prefer, you can replace the gremolata with a classic butter and sage seasoning or with a Parmigiano fondue.
