Mushroom loaf brings a whole new vibe to the table when you’re after something tender, rich, and a bit unexpected for dinner. In Italy, folks often make polpettone , usually packed with meat. But this vegetarian meatloaf ? It flips the script in the best way. Instead of the usual ingredients, you’ve got a mix of fresh mushrooms, earthy dried porcini, creamy beans, and toasted hazelnuts. And listen, it’s all mashed together with a zing of ginger. Really really good.
That combo? It’s moist and full of flavor, with little pockets of crunch from the nuts. It’s not just tasty—this mushroom loaf gets brushed with a sauce made from soaked porcini. It soaks in and gives every slice a boost of savory goodness. And look, you’ll see variations in different Italian homes—sometimes eggplant, lentils, or even potatoes get tossed in, and each version has its own twist.
Serving this dish feels like putting a little bit of Italian holiday spirit on your table, especially when paired with oven-glazed carrots that get sticky and a touch sweet thanks to maple syrup. For real. Both the loaf and the carrots cook at the same time, which just makes things easier. And ties the meal together.
People are usually surprised by how much this vegan meatloaf feels like the real deal—satisfying and filling, but still light enough that you don’t feel weighed down. Which is great. It’s a solid pick for anyone who wants a meatless meatloaf that’s original. Plus, it works for a festive meal, like a vegan Christmas lunch or when you’ve got guests who like trying something new.
With that mushroom meatloaf flavor and the mix of golden crust and soft inside, it checks all the boxes for a cozy dinner. You get the best of both worlds: tradition and a fresh, plant-based twist. Pretty simple. It’s a dish you’ll want to keep in your back pocket for all kinds of occasions. And here’s the thing, it’s a tasty conversation starter that shows how creative vegetarian cooking can be, celebrating both tradition and innovation.

To prepare the mushroom meatloaf, first soak the porcini mushrooms in cold water for 15 minutes 1 . Meanwhile, clean the mushrooms: remove the earthy base of the stem 2 and wipe them with a damp cloth, then cut them into cubes about 0.5 inches 3 .
Do the same with the champignons 4 . Finally, peel and chop the shallot 5 . In a non-stick pan, heat a drizzle of oil and add the shallot 6 .
Sauté for a few minutes, then add the cardoncelli mushrooms 7 and champignons 8 . Season with salt, pepper, and ginger 9 . Stir and brown for about 5 minutes over high heat.
Meanwhile, drain the dried porcini mushrooms and reserve the soaking water, which will be used later to make the sauce 10 . Roughly chop the porcini and add them to the pan 11 . Continue to brown the mushrooms until they are well toasted; it will take about 10-15 minutes in total 12 .
In the meantime, cut the bread into pieces 13 , transfer it to a food processor 14 , and blend to turn it into breadcrumbs 15 .
Set the breadcrumbs aside in a bowl and place the pre-cooked beans 16 , hazelnuts 17 , and sautéed mushrooms 18 in the same processor. Blend to combine the ingredients.
Add the breadcrumbs 19 and blend again until you obtain a fairly homogeneous mixture, then add the chopped parsley 20 . Adjust with salt and pepper and mix well 21 .
Place a sheet of parchment paper on the work surface, position the mushroom mixture in the center, and shape it into a loaf 22 . Wrap the parchment paper around the meatloaf 23 and seal the ends like a candy wrapper 24 . Place the package in a baking tray and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 30 minutes.
While the meatloaf is cooking, prepare the side dish: wash and tip the baby carrots 25 , then distribute them in a baking tray and season with oil 26 , salt, and pepper. Mix with your hands to coat the carrots evenly, then bake the tray along with the meatloaf and cook for 25-30 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: filter the mushroom soaking water with a paper towel 28 and pour 7 oz into a saucepan along with the cornstarch 29 and soy sauce 30 .
Add the oil 31 and pepper 32 , then turn on the heat and let it thicken, stirring often until you obtain a smooth and thick sauce 33 .
After 30 minutes, remove the meatloaf from the oven and open the package 34 , then brush it with the mushroom sauce 35 . Return the meatloaf to the oven uncovered and bake for another 20 minutes, still at 350°F. Once cooked, also remove the carrots and drizzle them with maple syrup 36 .
Add the thyme leaves 37 and roughly chopped hazelnuts 38 , give a stir, and put back in the oven for another 5-10 minutes, just until the meatloaf is ready. Once out of the oven, let the meatloaf rest for a few minutes. Finally, garnish with thyme and pepper and serve your mushroom meatloaf sliced and drizzled with the remaining sauce 39 !
The mushroom meatloaf can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, wrapped in plastic wrap; you can warm it up whole or in slices by browning it in a pan with a drizzle of oil.
You can freeze the meatloaf after cooking.
The carrots can be stored in the refrigerator for 1-2 days; you can reheat them in the oven or in a pan.
For the meatloaf, you can vary the type of mushrooms and beans as you prefer. If you use portobello mushrooms, make sure to brown them well to avoid them being watery.
If you can't find baby carrots, regular carrots cut lengthwise into 2 or 3 pieces will work fine. Alternatively, you can serve classic roasted potatoes or a red cabbage salad flavored with cumin seeds as a side dish.
The mushroom sauce is also great for enriching pasta dishes or thickening a soup!
