If you're looking to bring a taste of Southern Italy into your kitchen, this baked squid recipe is just what you need. It combines the classic flavors of the Mediterranean with a modern twist. Seriously good. In regions like Campania and Sicily, seafood is a staple, and using pangrattato (Italian breadcrumbs) mixed with panko creates a really really good crunch. And look, this oven-baked squid has a crispy exterior, while the inside stays so so tender and juicy.
Baking rather than frying gives you that golden crunch without all the extra oil, making it a healthier choice. Pretty simple. You can enjoy it at a casual family dinner, or make it the centerpiece of a holiday feast. Add your personal touch with parsley, lemon zest, or chili flakes—customizing is part of the fun!
During festive occasions like Christmas Eve, when seafood is a must-have, this dish fits right in. And here's the thing, it’s not just for special occasions. It’s perfect for any dinner. The fresh squid paired with the crunchy coating is a satisfying combination that everyone loves. As healthy squid recipes go, this one is low in fat but high in flavor. Plus, it is easy to prepare. It aligns with Mediterranean seafood recipes that really let the seafood shine.
Unlike heavier fried calamari, this easy baked squid is light and tender, so you can enjoy more without feeling full. Families might add local herbs or adapt the breadcrumbs to what they have, making each version unique—which is great. Whether you serve it with a fresh salad, roasted vegetables, or just a squeeze of lemon, this is one of those baked seafood dishes that always gets people talking—and coming back for seconds. It's a delicious way to experience the flavors of Italy right at home.
