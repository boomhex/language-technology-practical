Gluten-free torta pasqualina is one of those dishes that just screams celebration, especially around Easter in Liguria. Seriously good stuff. You get this tender, flaky crust—thanks to a solid gluten-free swap—that still gives you the same comfort as the old-school version. And look, what really sets this gluten-free Italian savory pie apart is the filling. Big scoops of creamy ricotta, lots of chopped Swiss chard (bietole, which folks in Liguria are serious about), and those whole hard-boiled eggs that peek out in every slice. And the eggs? That surprise of golden egg in the middle isn’t just for show; it’s a classic symbol of the holiday and always gets people talking at the table.
Even with the gluten-free dough, the pie stays moist and flavorful, and the greens work so well with the mild, almost sweet ricotta. Whether you eat it fresh from the oven or pack it up for a picnic on Pasquetta (Easter Monday), this gluten-free torta pasqualina makes any meal feel special and homey. And here's the thing, in Liguria, it’s all about keeping those traditional flavors front and center. Swapping in a gluten-free pie crust means anyone avoiding gluten can still get in on the fun without missing out on taste or texture.
The crust holds up just right—never soggy, still crispy around the edges—and the filling really shines. Folks who have tried other gluten-free Easter pie recipes will notice this version feels like the real deal, not just a substitute. Really really delicious. It fits right in with a bunch of gluten-free Easter recipes , whether you’re making a whole spread or just want one standout dish. And you know, even people who don’t need to avoid gluten end up loving the rich, tender slices. With a pie like this, the vibe is all about sharing, enjoying old traditions, and making sure everyone around the table gets a taste of something comforting and totally delicious, no matter their diet. That’s the thing about a gluten-free torta pasqualina —it’s just good food, made for everyone.

To prepare the gluten-free Easter pie, first start with the shortcrust pastry: in a food processor, pour in the gluten-free flour mix, the cold butter 1 , and a pinch of salt 2 . Turn on the mixer and slowly pour in cold water 3 .
When the water is well absorbed 4 , transfer the dough to the work surface 5 . Knead lightly with your hands 5 just enough to compact it into a ball. Cover with plastic wrap 6 and transfer to the refrigerator while you prepare the filling.
Peel and finely chop the onion 7 . In a large pan, heat a drizzle of oil, then add the chopped onion 8 and stew over medium-low heat for about 8-10 minutes, adding a little water 9 .
Now add the chard 10 and cook for a few minutes, just enough to soften them 11 . Drain the chard to remove excess liquid 12 and let cool.
When the chard has cooled, transfer it to a bowl with the egg 13 , grated cheese 14 , and a pinch of salt. Separately, mix the ricotta, which you have drained in a sieve if necessary, with the eggs 15 .
Season with grated cheese 16 , nutmeg 17 , and salt. Mix everything and set aside. At this point, take the dough from the fridge and roll it out with a rolling pin, dusting with a little gluten-free flour 18 .
Form a disc with a diameter of about 12 inches 19 and roll the sheet onto the rolling pin. Unroll the sheet over a flared tin that measures 8 inches at the base and 9.5 inches at the rim, about 2 inches high 20 . Pass the rolling pin over the rim to cut off the excess dough 21 , which will need to be worked and rolled out again for the top layer.
Now pour the chard filling into the tin 22 and level it well with the back of a spoon 23 , then add the ricotta filling 24 .
Level here too to have a smooth surface 25 . Make 7 depressions with a spoon 26 , shell the eggs separately and gently place them in these spaces 27 , being careful not to break them.
Roll out the rest of the shortcrust pastry, place it over the tin, and seal the edges 28 . With the tip of a knife, make holes across the surface to let air escape during baking 29 . Finally, brush the surface with the mixed egg yolk and cream 30 .
Bake in a preheated oven at 350°F on the lowest rack (not touching the base of the oven) for 70 minutes 31 . Remove from the oven and let your gluten-free Easter pie cool 32 before cutting and serving it 33 !
The gluten-free Easter pie can be stored for 2-3 days in the fridge.
It can be frozen after baking, already portioned.
The chard can be replaced with spinach.
If you like, you can use sheep's ricotta, which has a more intense and strong flavor.
For gluten-free recipes, we recommend purchasing only products that display the crossed-out spike on the packaging, certified gluten-free, recommended by the AIC Italian Celiac Association guidebook.
