Gorgonzola and apple risotto is one of those dishes you don't expect to be so amazing, but trust me, it really is. This combo, super popular in Northern Italy —especially in regions like Lombardy and Piedmont —brings together flavors that are both creamy and tender. The secret? Those sautéed apples. They stay a bit crunchy, giving you a perfect blend of sweet fruit with rich cheese. It's a mix, really, that makes gorgonzola and apple risotto something special. And look, throughout the region, you'll find other risotto recipes with local cheeses or pears, but this one's got a balance that's just, well, perfect for something different. It's the kind of dish you whip up to impress at a gathering, or when you want a cozy meal at home. Really good stuff.
Northern Italians are pretty much masters at making every ingredient shine, and risotto with gorgonzola and apple is a testament to that. The rice gets super moist and almost silky—thanks to the melting cheese. But here's the thing: you still get that little crunch from the apples, so it never feels too heavy. Some folks call this a creamy risotto recipe , but honestly, it's more than just texture. The way the salty gorgonzola packs a punch, while the apples add a tangy sweetness, makes it seriously addictive. Compared to other blue cheese risotto dishes, this one feels lighter. The fruit really makes it.
And listen, in Northern Italy, they even switch up the apples, from tart to sweet, depending on what's in season. It's like, if you're into savory apple recipes or want to try an easy risotto with apples that's a bit different—this one's a keeper. For real. Plus, it’s a fantastic way to dive into Italian risotto variations, where simple ideas turn out surprisingly fancy.

Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and season with oil 7 , salt, and pepper 8 . Bake in a fan oven, preheated to 392°F (200°C) for 15 minutes. Separately, cut an apple into slices 1/12 inch (2 mm) thick 9 .

If gorgonzola is too strong for your taste, you can replace it with a milder cheese like robiola or taleggio. You can add a crunchy touch with chopped walnuts, toasted almond slices, or pistachios.
