The creamy white lasagna is all about that luxurious béchamel that soaks into the egg pasta sheets. It’s moist and comforting—which is great. Italians love to add their own twist, maybe cherry tomatoes or artichokes, for that extra pop of flavor. What’s really awesome about this vegetable lasagna with white sauce is its flexibility. You can, you know, get creative with what’s on hand or find some fresh picks at a local market. Perfect for any occasion, pretty much.
Across Italy, you'll find a bunch of ways to mix it up. In the north, someone might throw in a layer of pesto or sliced carrots for a bit of sweet contrast.

Ricotta gives a creamy texture while Parmigiano-Reggiano on top gets all golden and bubbly. Seriously good. With all these possibilities, it’s no wonder a white sauce lasagna is a hit at family gatherings and casual hangouts. No need to follow a strict recipe. This béchamel sauce lasagna really, really encourages mixing and matching flavors you love. Each dinner is fun and a little different.

To prepare the white vegetarian lasagna, start with the egg pasta: pour the flour into a bowl 1 , setting aside about 50g. In another bowl, beat the eggs, then add them to the flour 2 and start kneading until the ingredients are combined 3 .
At this point, transfer the mixture to a work surface and knead it 4 , adding the reserved flour as needed, until you obtain a smooth, firm, and elastic dough, shaping it into a spherical shape 5 . Wrap it in plastic wrap 6 and let it rest for about 30-60 minutes out of the fridge in a cool, dry place.
In the meantime, work on the béchamel: pour the butter into a saucepan 7 , let it melt gently, then add the sifted flour, stirring quickly 8 . Once you have a hazelnut-colored roux, add the boiling milk 9 and stir again.
Season your béchamel with a pinch of pepper 10 , salt, a grate of nutmeg 11 , and continue to cook, always stirring, for 5-6 minutes until it reaches the right consistency. At this point, transfer the béchamel to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap in contact 12 .
Wash all the vegetables and start cutting them: peel the carrots and cut them into julienne strips 13 , for the broccoli, only take the florets 14 , and finely slice the onion 15 .
Trim the zucchini and also cut them into julienne strips 16 . Clean the mushrooms, slice them 17 , and cut the cherry tomatoes in half 18 .
Once all the vegetables are prepared, pour the oil into a pan and add the carrots first 19 , let them cook for a couple of minutes and then add the broccoli. Add a splash of water 20 , cover with a lid and let cook for 3-4 minutes. At this point, also add the onions 21 .
Finally, add the zucchini 22 and mushrooms 23 and cook, stirring occasionally. Once cooked, salt and pepper, then turn off the heat and add the cherry tomatoes and thyme 24 .
In the meantime, your egg pasta will have rested, so take the dough and divide it in half 25 . Roll out the pasta with a pasta machine 26 , reducing the thickness each time 27 .
You will need to obtain sheets of about 2 mm thickness. Cut 8 rectangles of 6x8 inches from the sheets 28 . Blanch the sheets for 1 minute in boiling, lightly salted water 29 , then drain and lay them on a tray lined with a kitchen towel 30 . If you prefer, you can quickly dip the sheets in a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking, then spread the rectangles out on a clean towel, but the important thing is to lay the various rectangles flat and without overlapping.
Once the pasta is cooked, take a 12x8 inch baking dish, add 2 or 3 tablespoons of béchamel 31 and spread it at the base of the pan. Place 2 pasta rectangles side by side, then cover with more béchamel, sprinkle with grated cheese 32 , and add a third of the vegetables 33 .
Cover with another 2 pasta sheets 34 and proceed in this way to make another 2 layers, until all the ingredients are used up. Once you reach the last layer of béchamel 35 , sprinkle with more grated cheese, cover with the remaining vegetables and bake in a preheated static oven at 350°F for 20 minutes, then turn on the grill and bake for another 5 minutes. Your white vegetarian lasagna is ready to be served 36 !
The vegetarian lasagna can be stored in the refrigerator covered with plastic wrap for up to 1-2 days.
They can be frozen either raw or cooked.
The great thing about vegetables is that every season has many different types!
