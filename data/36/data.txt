Pasta and potato supplì are, I gotta say, a wild spin on classic Italian appetizers . And they mix the best parts of two regional favorites—super super delicious. Drawing from Naples, where pasta e patate is like the ultimate cozy dish, this street food twist wraps those tender flavors into a crispy Roman-style snack. The real magic? When you bite through the golden shell and hit that melty provola cheese center—talk about the famous "al telefono" cheese pull you get with true Roman supplì . Instead of the usual rice, this version uses a rich, moist pasta and potato blend, kicked up with smoky lardo and a good shake of black pepper. Folks in Campania are all about those deep, hearty flavors, and you can really really taste it with every bite. It's like getting a bit of Naples and Rome at once, especially when you catch those hints of provola and the soft potato inside.
Across Southern Italy, everyone has their take on pasta recipes , but this mash-up? It feels especially fun at parties or casual get-togethers. There's something playful about how the crispy outside gives way to all that creamy goodness inside—kinda like arancini, but with a surprise twist. People who love traditional potato croquettes or even fans of rice balls will want to check out this snack since it really stands out among homemade supplì . In Rome, they fill their supplì with mozzarella, but here, the swap for provola brings a smoky hit that goes great with the southern vibe.
And here's the thing, the best part is the mix of textures: the crunchy breading, soft potato, and stringy cheese all in one bite. It’s the sort of food that shows up at street fairs and instantly disappears from the tray—can't go wrong. Whether you’re into Italian appetizers or just want a new take on easy pasta dishes, this street food is sure to surprise folks with its mix of familiar flavors done in a totally new way. Perfect for those who enjoy a little culinary adventure, this dish captures the heart and soul of Italian street food culture. Pretty much.

To make the pasta and potato supplì, first prepare the vegetable broth and keep it warm. Start with the vegetables for the soffritto: clean and cut the carrots 1 , celery 2 , and onion 3 into 3/8 inch dice.
Dice the lard as well 4 . Peel the potatoes and cut them into the same-sized cubes 5 . Finally, finely chop the rosemary 6 .
Heat the oil in a large saucepan, then add the chopped vegetables 7 , lard 8 , and rosemary 9 .
Sauté over medium-high heat for 5 minutes, stirring often 10 . At this point, add the potatoes 11 and salt 12 .
Season with black pepper 13 and tomato paste 14 , then cover everything with a portion of the vegetable broth 15 .
Stir and cook over medium heat for 25 minutes 16 . After this time, add the mixed pasta 17 and cover just enough with the remaining vegetable broth 18 .
Continue cooking over medium heat for about 15 minutes, ensuring the broth keeps simmering 19 . Stir frequently to prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottom 20 . Once cooked, turn off the heat and add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano 21 .
Mix well 22 , then transfer the pasta and potatoes to a baking sheet 24 , spreading it across the surface 24 . Place the tray in the refrigerator.
Meanwhile, cut the scamorza into strips 25 . After the cooling time, wet your hands and take a portion of pasta and potatoes, lightly pressing it in the palm, then add the scamorza 26 and seal it inside to form supplì 27 ; with these quantities, you should get about 20.
After forming all the supplì, you're ready for the breading: coat the supplì first in flour 28 , then in beaten eggs 29 , and finally in the mix of fine and rustic breadcrumbs 30 .
Heat the seed oil to 320°F and fry 1-2 supplì at a time for about 4 minutes 31 . When they are nicely golden, drain them on paper for frying 32 . Your pasta and potato supplì are ready, serve them hot 33 !
Pasta and potato supplì can be stored in the refrigerator for one day.
The supplì can be frozen raw and then fried directly from frozen, slightly increasing the cooking time.
It's important to measure the oil temperature for frying to ensure a crispy outer shell and a stringy interior.
Remember to wet your hands before forming the supplì: this way the pasta won't stick to your hands and it will be easier to shape them into the classic oval shape.
