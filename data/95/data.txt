To prepare the crystal dumplings, start with the dough: in a bowl, pour the wheat starch and cornstarch 1 . Mix the powders with chopsticks (or a spoon), then slowly pour in the boiling water 2 . Once all the water is absorbed, knead by hand 3 .
Transfer the dough to a work surface and continue kneading until it becomes smooth and elastic; this step requires a lot of energy because the dough is quite tough 4 . Form a ball, place it in the bowl, and cover with plastic wrap 5 . Let it rest for 5 minutes, then incorporate the lard, which will give the dough more elasticity 6 .
Form the dough into a ball again, place it back in the bowl 7 , and brush the surface with sesame oil to keep it hydrated 8 . Cover with plastic wrap and set aside while you prepare the filling. Finely chop the cleaned shrimp with a knife 9 .
You should obtain a very fine mince 10 . Transfer the shrimp to a bowl, then add the ground pork 11 and half a chopped scallion 12 .
Now season with grated ginger 13 , soy sauce, oyster sauce 14 , and sesame oil 15 .
Also add some ground white pepper 16 and a pinch of salt. Mix well to combine the filling 17 . Now take the dough to form the dumplings: take pieces weighing about 20 g (0.7 oz) for each dumpling 18 . Cover the rest of the dough with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out.
Roll out the dough ball by applying light pressure with the side of your palm: the disc should be thinner at the edges so that the thicker center won't crack during cooking. Lift the disc from the work surface with a scraper, then fill the center with a teaspoon of filling 20 . Fold it in half, aligning the two edges 21 .
Pinch the edges firmly at the center 22 , then close the dumplings, slightly pleating the edges as you seal 23 , to create a wavy pattern 24 . With these quantities, you'll get about 16 dumplings.
Prepare the steamer basket, line it with a sheet of parchment paper with small holes, and place the dumplings 25 . Cover with the appropriate lid and steam for 8-10 minutes 26 . Serve your crystal dumplings with soy sauce 27 !
The crystal dumplings can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
For best results, it's advisable to reheat them in a pan with some water to keep them soft and flavorful. If not consumed within that period, they can be frozen (either before or after cooking).
Crystal dumplings can be filled with a mixed vegetable filling, such as mushrooms, spinach, and tofu, for a tasty vegetarian version. For a more aromatic taste, try a filling based on Chinese cabbage, scallion, and a pinch of ginger.
